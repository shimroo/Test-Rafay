 "er frequencies" has taken us on a journey to the hearts and minds of many eritreans and friends of eritrea, who have supported us with their presence at our shows in toronto, dallas, minnesota,la, san jose, oakland etc. the magnitude of the positive feedback and anticipation for more creations on our part has been the source of the motivation that propells us to work harder and with intensified dedication. we are humbled to be told that many at the eritrean festival and 
soccer tournaments felt that "er frequencies" was one of the best albums 
they have purchased that year. now the question remains, will our second 
album entitled "     ", live up to the hype and expectations? well, only 
time will tell and we hope the single that will drop in may will give y'all 
a hint of what is cooking in the kitchen. this time around the challenge 
isn't necessarily lyrical, but would we have our own original production? 
our own sound? maybe something that will pave a way for others to take it to 
another level? hmmm, i guess we will have to wait and see. stay tuned.

with love,
aermed mindz
