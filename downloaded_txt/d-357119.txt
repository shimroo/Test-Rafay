chicktok details how compression saves them thousands of dollars













if one type of website benefits from data compression the most, then it’s websites that stream videos to many users. chick tok is one of these sites that allows users to meetup for sex. thousands of users upload and view videos from their site every day, and by fine tuning their use of compression, they’re able to save thousands of dollars every day.
while there are a few different ways that you can compress your video files so that they take up less space on your hard drive, or store them faster in the cloud, the method that chicktok uses to do this is called “variable bitrate.” this method of compressing allows you to change how much data each individual frame contains based on what the user wants to see at any given time.
this means that instead of having all the frames for an entire scene stored as one large file, you would have a bunch of small files which contain only the parts of the file that need to be displayed at any point during playback. this not only saves space on your server, but it also speeds up the load times of your videos.
chicktok’s compression algorithms
chicktok has choosen to go with the vbr encoding format because it gives them more flexibility than other methods. there are a lot of other formats out there like h.264 or mpeg-4 part 10, but since these are designed for different types of media, they don’t always give you the same kind of control over how your video looks. with vbr encoding, you can still get great quality while saving a ton of space, so long as your traffic volume doesn’t increase too quickly.
in order to find the right balance between savings and quality with live streaming, chicktok has been experimenting with several different algorithms for the last couple months. in their latest test, they’ve found that using the following parameters results in a good compromise:
frame size – 400 kbps
segment count – 2
chunk size – 16
bandwidth – 4mbps
they also came up with a way to avoid duplicate segments that will help ensure that no single segment takes up more than four times its original size. if you ever wanted to learn about how some of the most popular porn sites handle their compression, look no further!
chicktok uses variable bitrate to save money on server costs
a big reason why chick tok has chosen to use variable bitrate is because it helps them save money on their server costs. when you’re dealing with a site that gets millions of hits per month, even a 1% decrease in cost can make a big difference. that’s especially true when you’re talking about a site that’s already spending $30,000 a month on servers alone.
other sites might not need to worry about saving money on their server costs quite as much since they probably don’t have anywhere near the amount of bandwidth and storage space that chicktok does, but they could still benefit from using vbr encoding if they’re dealing with a lot of data transfers. as long as they’re happy with the quality of their videos and don’t mind the decreased download speed, vbr encoding would be a good way to save some cash.
what about the quality?
some people wonder whether or not variable bitrate really makes a big enough difference to matter. it’s certainly true that a lot of people will never notice the difference between a video encoded at 1 mbps and one at 4 mbps. however, in certain circumstances, even a slight drop in quality could be noticeable.
for example, if someone had a perfect computer with lightning fast internet connection, they probably wouldn’t care about the extra megabytes that were saved by compressing the video. but if they had a slow pc and bad internet, the difference would be obvious.
the same goes for smartphones. if you’re watching a video on your smartphone while you’re out and about, you’ll definitely want to keep the data usage down, but if you’re watching on your home desktop, you’re going to be more concerned with the overall picture, not the individual pixels.

how sex chat sites use data compression to stream video for thousands













when you watch a video on your computer, the file gets converted from its native format to something that can be streamed over the internet. this is called data compression and it’s so important that companies like google spend millions of dollars on research and development in order to improve their algorithms.
it may not seem like this is a big deal for people who just want to catch up on some porn or hang out with their friends while watching videos, but for sex chat sites, it means saving hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. there are numerous websites devoted entirely to live webcam shows where users pay a small fee per minute to interact with the performers. 
if these sites were able to stream high quality video at an affordable price, they would have no problem competing against free services like skype and tango. however, there are many factors that prevent them from doing so: bandwidth costs, latency issues, data caps, network congestion, and others. let us explore how each of these challenges has been addressed by various companies in order to save money.
bandwidth costs
the cost of streaming video over the internet varies depending on a number of factors. the most obvious one is the amount of traffic traversing the network. a single connection is capable of carrying a limited amount of data before it saturates and begins dropping packets. 
this slows everything down even more until it finally drops. at that point, all your users will get is a frozen screen. this limits the amount of data that can be carried over any given connection. it also depends on the type of connection used – cable, fiber optic, dsl, and so forth. there is a lot of variability in how much bandwidth a user needs to stream a video using traditional methods.
thousands of sex chat users
in addition, the amount of traffic generated by a single person watching a video is relatively low compared to the number of viewers per hour. this is particularly true for live webcam shows where multiple users are interacting with the same performer. 
as the number of viewers increases, the amount of data required to keep everyone connected and happy increases exponentially. the bottom line is that it takes a lot of money to maintain high bandwidth connections for all those users. that’s why companies often opt to use lower quality streams when dealing with large numbers of people.
latency issues
another factor impacting bandwidth usage is the time it takes to send and receive data. latency refers to the delay between sending a request to a server and receiving the response. imagine you’re sitting in front of your computer trying to watch a video. you ask the remote server to start playing the file and the first thing you see is the loading bar. 
how fast can you click the play button again after waiting for the progress indicator to disappear? this delay is referred to as the round trip time (rtt) and it affects both the performance of the application and the perceived quality of the video itself. in some cases, the delay can reach several seconds which makes it hard to follow what’s happening during the show.
data caps
one of the biggest problems for webcam models is bandwidth caps. some isps charge customers based on the amount of data sent and received across their network. for example, if you connect to the internet via a modem that requires a monthly fee to rent, your provider will probably impose a cap on how much data you’re allowed to transfer. 
what happens when that limit is reached? your internet speed grinds to a halt until the next billing cycle rolls around. this is especially frustrating for webcam models because their job relies on streaming video to their audience. they want to make sure that all potential viewers are able to see the show without any interruptions.
network congestion
congestion is another problem affecting traditional streaming. when a huge amount of traffic is being transferred over a network, it can slow down or even stop altogether. this is a common issue with networks congested by …

how google’s img compression shrinks by 35













if you’re in the business of image transfer and storage or if you just have a website with some high-quality photos that take forever to load, listen up because google might just have what you need.
google continues to have the answer to literally everything. they have recently announced a method of data compression that maintains maximum image quality while reducing the size of the file significantly. this method is fairly new when it comes to jpeg compression, and while it is still lossy compression, you’re losing a whole lot less than if you use a different method.
the question that remains is how google managed to achieve this. the short answer is that google can essentially do everything you can possibly think of given the right amount of time. the more accurate answer is a little longer. here’s how google manages to be number one when it comes to jpeg compression:
* firstly, let me explain how exactly jpeg image compression works. this method exploits flaws in human vision by removing color and detail that we cannot or have trouble detecting.
this method converts a photo from rgb to a different color space called ycbcr. y has everything to do with brightness, which is what humans detect the most and it goes largely untouched by compression. cb and cr are targeted by compression as they contain color that humans wouldn’t notice if it went missing.
the method breaks the photos up into 8×8 groups of pixels and determines which color information is important and deletes what can go without being detected.
* google’s method is not very much different. the change comes in the last part of the process where the color information is discarded.
the program, nicknamed guetzil which is german for cookie, eliminates color information in a very meticulous way so that it allow the image to resize without compromising the overall quality. the way it does this is by eliminating extra colors that the human eye can’t discern from one another.
* the most important feature of this kind of compression is how the image doesn’t need to be changed for it to be compatible with multiple browsers.
usually when you compress an image the format changes so that browsers read it differently which causes problems when you’re putting this image on say a website.
this takes out an extra step in your image compression process and allows for your site to look great across all platforms without compromising quality for an oversized file that takes forever to load.
google knows how important it is for the web to be fast. it makes sense why they would develop this different kind of compression process. in all guetizil is the best option for your image compression needs.
you get to have an image that doesn’t look like it went through a lossy compression process at all and that is compatable across all browsers. basically google is god, especially when it comes to the web.…

3 things your wife wished you knew about image compression













have you ever wondered why it takes a literal century for some websites to load? have you ever given up on a site because you’re stuck waiting there with an image slowly loading down the page? have you ever seen your site do this and do you worry that people are clicking off? well failing at compression is kind of like sleeping with your friend’s wife – it’s a big issue with a lot of unforeseen consequences. use these 3 tips to make sure you’re not making the worst image compression fails.
well, if you answered yes to those questions – especially that last one – you need to compress your images.
image compression is vital if you’re planning on storing and transferring images or even if you’re just trying to build a functional yet visually pleasing website.
if you’re new to the concept of image compression, here are a few vital things you need to know:
1. why you should compress your images
image compression isn’t just an extra, arbitrary step to take when creating a site or storing images. compressing your images allows them to load quickly and make them efficient to transfer.
and no, compression doesn’t mean just making them smaller on the page. compression requires you to reduce the cost or the amount of storage space; it takes up. if you have an image that’s in wildly high quality, it will take forever to load, even if you size it down to a tiny little rectangle. this is because the quality doesn’t decrease when you make it smaller, and the quality is what makes the file so large.
when you are going to have a photo on the web, you need to compress it, even if you’re planning on having it visually sized down.
2. how images compress
there are several different ways images are compressed depending on the kind of method you decide to you – which also depends on why you are compressing the image in the first place.
however, the way images are compressed has everything to do with reducing the file size. by reducing the file size, you’re basically reducing the information that’s stored in the photo, or you’re encoding it in a different way.
there are two different kinds of compression – which i will explain in a second – one of which will cause your image to lose some of it’s quality while the other will not.
3. lossy vs. lossless compression
there are two main kinds of compression: lossy and lossless. they’re kind of self-explanatory. by using a method that is lossy, the image loses quality, by using a lossless method you retain quality while making the file smaller and easier to transfer.
lossless is the kind of compression mainly used if you’re trying to save an image into a type of archival system. if you need to retain every ounce of quality – and thusly information – you’ll want to use a lossless compression method as this will make sure the image is still crisp and detailed



if you’re using a photo for a website or in a type of print publication, you’ll want to use a lossy kind of method. this reduces the size of the image and reduces some of its quality. this allows for faster loading online and allows your photos to still look good without taking up unnecessary space.…

7 things beginners need to know about data compression













whether you’re a hobby blogger, or a journalist, or a super programmer extraordinaire, you need to know the basics of data compassion.
data compression is vital across multiple professional fields as well as plenty of what we affectionately call “side hustles.” it’s important to know how the size of data can affect how it loads online, how it can be sent back and forth, and what different methods of compression due to the information you’re trying to send.
so let’s talk about this extremely relevant topic which is becoming more and more important to understand – and put to practical use – in the digital age:
what is data compression?
okay, so think about the word compression: it means to reduce in volume and comes from a middle english word meaning “to press together.” in a sense, data compression is the pressing together of data to make it easier to send or load.
data compression techniques fall into two categories: lossy and lossless, which is relatively self-explanatory. lossy techniques will lose data when used, whereas lossless techniques will maintain the original integrity of the file(s) you’re compressing.
lossy techniques are great for compressing images that are needlessly large when putting them online or in print (because there are only so many pixels on a screen meaning that the image can just be so sharp regardless of how high quality it is). if you’re putting up a photo on a website or in a print publication, you’re going to want to compress the image so that it loses some of its data.
if you are archiving an image, you’re going to want to use a lossless technique because you don’t want to ruin the integrity of the original file. who knows, maybe it will be used in a future project in a way where you need all that extra data that isn’t relevant for average print or online publication.
obviously there are plenty of other reasons to compress files; however, using photos as an example is a great way to explain the difference between lossy and lossless compression.
why is it important?
data compression is necessary because you’re probably going to be using it some capacity. there are very few fields which don’t require the use of computers in some way nowadays, which means you’re going to need to be able to communicate and send information effectively.
data compression is something as simple as sending a zip file of vacation photos to your aunt and something as complicated as sending an entire program to a colleague across the country.
you need to understand and be able to implement data compression to ensure you’re using the right technique and the right programs that are right for your needs and provide the proper amount of security.
winrar vs 7zip:
speaking of programs…
there’s long-standing competition between winrar and 7zip when it comes to compression software.after doing some research and experimentation of my own, i’ve concluded that 7zip is the better of the two… you can always decide for yourself, but recently winrar has finally discovered and fixed a 19-year-old vulnerability in its software… i don’ know about you, but i’m not taking my chances against the hackers, i’ll use 7zip!…

how the adult industry revolutionized image and video compression













introduction
you might think the birth of cinema was what revolutionized image and video technologies to advance to what they are today, but a big player in that that often gets left out of the conversation is the adult industry. ever since, le coucher de la marie, what is known as the first pornographic film came out in france, people wanted more and more of a naked woman on camera, leading to new developments in image and video compression. as porn continued to thrive as a business, it became an industry leader in what technologies would be adopted for viewing video and images, as well as taking them, and could be responsible for much of the tech we have today.as such, porn will continue to be applied to the new advancements in video and imaging, even if they’re not intended for its use because the adult industry will always find a way to take advantage of the latest tech for its customers.
super 8 film
before there were 4k cameras capturing your porn, there were super 8 cameras that shot on 8 mm film recording women undressing and posing for the camera. porn films got their start in mass production in 1958 when harrison mark began shooting these short films called “glamour home movies.” people realized the ease of being able to record and view explicit films like these and sales of super 8 cameras rose. it was a cheap camera at the time, noncomplex to use, and highly convenient. with the increase in sales and its accessibility and convenience, super 8 became standardized and was adopted in the porn industry for shooting films.
vcr
many believe that bollywood and hollywood movies gave rise to the popularity of vhs tapes, but there’s a reason you used to find so many adult video stores on the corner of every street. that’s because porn videos, who used to be on cassettes under betamax format (which they also made popular), caused vhs format to win over betamax in the late ’80s since porn producers chose to go with this format. prior to this, when vcr format was first introduced, hollywood wasn’t convinced to make the switch and release films on the format for fear of piracy, but porn decided to take the format and use it as a way to exploit the market and distribute more porn films.the reason why pornographers preferred vhs over betamax was that it could hold more footage, up to three hours, and it gave viewers the option to view pornography in the comfort of their own home, behind closed doors. clearly, this was something all pornography viewers wanted, and these viewers were some of the earliest to adopt vhs technology and were responsible for the rise of vhs to the mainstream. by the end of the ’70s, more than 50% of all videotape sales in the united states.
blu-ray
similar to how porn helped push out betamax video format to vhs, another situation like this came about in the fight between hd dvd and blu-ray. when vhs format died out, the porn industry was looking for something new to display high-definition video of their films. at the time, there were two options: hd dvd and a new technology called blu-ray, which was a high-definition optical disk that held more information than hd dvd. because of that fact, pornographers adopted blu-ray to distribute their films as they could put more content on them. the victory of blu-ray over hd dvd happened when the porn industry chose the former as their standard for high-definition video format.
streaming video
from vhs and blu-ray, porn moved onto its biggest platform yet – streaming video. the age of the internet brought you websites like pornhub, redtube, youporn, brazzers, etc., and with it, a new adoption of technology for porn to thrive on. it’s estimated that 30% of content on the internet is porn, with over 4.2 million pornographic websites in the u.s. alone, and they attract more users in a month than amazon, netflix, and twitter combined. dutch porn company red light district was the first to develop a workable internet-based video streaming system back in 1994. they were pioneers …

compression basics














introduction
because real-world files usually are quite redundant, compression can often reduce the file sizes considerably. this in turn reduces the needed storage size and transfer channel capacity. especially in systems where memory is at premium compression can make the difference between impossible and implementable. commodore 64 and its relatives are good examples of this kind of a system.
the most used 5.25-inch disk drive for commodore 64 only holds 170 kb of data, which is only about 2.5 times the total random access memory of the machine. with compression, many more programs can fit on a disk. this is especially true for programs containing flashy graphics or sampled sound. compression also reduces the loading times from the notoriously slow 1541 drive, whether you use the original slow serial bus routines or some kind of a disk turbo loader routine.
dozens of compression programs are available for commodore 64. i leave the work to chronicle the history of the c64 compression programs to others and concentrate on a general overview of the different compression algorithms. later we’ll take a closer look on how the compression algorithms actually work and in the next article i will introduce my own creation: pucrunch.
pucrunch is a compression program written in ansi-c which generates files that automatically decompress and execute themselves when run on a c64 (or c128 in c64-mode, vic20, c16/+4). a cross-compressor, if you will, allowing you to do the real work on any machine, like a cross-assembler.
our target environment (commodore 64 and vic20) restricts us somewhat when designing the ‘ideal’ compression system. we would like it to be able to decompress as big a program as possible. therefore the decompression code must be located in low memory and be as short as possible and must use very small amounts of extra memory.
another requirement is that the decompression should be relatively fast, which means that the arithmetic used should be mostly 8- or 9-bit which is much faster than e.g. 16-bit arithmetic. processor- and memory-intensive algorithms are pretty much out of the question. a part of the decompressor efficiency depends on the format of the compressed data. byte-aligned codes can be accessed very quickly; non-byte-aligned codes are much slower to handle, but provide better compression.
this is not meant to be the end-all document for data compression. my intention is to only scratch the surface and give you a crude overview. also, i’m mainly talking about lossless compression here, although some lossy compression ideas are briefly mentioned. a lot of compression talk is available in the world wide web, although it may not be possible to understand everything on the first reading. to build the knowledge, you have to read many documents and understand something from each one so that when you return to a document, you can understand more than the previous time. it’s a lot like watching babylon 5. 🙂
some words of warning: i try to give something interesting to read to both advanced and not so advanced readers. it is perfectly all right for you to skip all uninteresting details. i start with a huffman and lz77 example so you can get the basic idea before flooding you with equations, complications, and trivia.
huffman and lz77 example
let’s say i had some simple language like “chippish” containing only the letters cdisv. how would a string like
	sidviciiisididvi
compress using a) huffman encoding, and b) lz77? how do compression concepts such as information entropy enter into this?
a direct binary code would map the different symbols to consequtive bit patterns, such as:
	symbol  code	'c'	000	'd'	001	'i'	010	's'	011	'v'	100
because there are five symbols, we need 3 bits to represent all of the possibilities, but we also don’t use all the possibilities. only 5 values are used out of the maximum 8 that can be represented in 3 bits. with this code the original message takes 48 bits:
	sidviciiisididvi ==	011 010 001 100 010 000 010 010 010 011 010 001 010 001 100 010
for huffman and for entropy calculation (entropy is explained in the next chapter) we first need to calculate the symbol frequencies from the message. the probability …

7 keys to effective affiliate marketing













when jumping into affiliate marketing there are a couple key things you need to keep in mind. sure you can understand all the logistics, but you need to make sure you don’t get lazy and forget about checking these boxes. lucky for you, i made a short list of things you should always be keeping in mind. here are the 7 keys to affiliate marketing:
1.  headlines over content
if you don’t already know how important headlines are, you’re doing something wrong. you should spend a big chuck of your time making sure that your headlines are as perfect as they can be. they need to be clickable, rankable, and eye-catching.
i recommend spending at least 10-15 minutes on thinking about how you can make your headline(s) better.
2.  content over links
you shouldn’t be writing content with the goal of getting particular links and key words in there. google has changed their algorithm to where key words don’t matter as much.
so, when you’re writing, write for content. and as you’re writing, think about what links you want to insert in there. because believe me, google will notice if there are links missing.
3.  promote products you actually use
this is super important. if you are promoting something you have little to know experience with, consumers are going to either a) smell the b.s. from a mile away or b) know you’re lying as soon as they download/buy. either way you lose the market’s trust.
be honest about what you’re using because you don’t want to see traffic slow down because you’re a liar.
4.  call to action
a call to action is something that often gets forgotten about. at the end, or even throughout, your article you need to have a call to action. this gets the reader thinking about what they ought to do right after reading through your work.
make sure your call to action is clear, repetitive (if it needs to be), and direct. provide your readers with links to make it even easier for them to click through.
5.  optimize for mobile
you need to be thinking about mobile if you want to succeed. if your site doesn’t look good on a phone screen you are doing something very, very wrong.
make sure that your site is optimized for mobile because let’s face it, more people are browsing online via phone than ever before and that number is going to continue to increase.
6.  be aware of what’s in season
just like fashion, searches are seasonal. be cautious of the holidays, the weather, and what people might be searching for throughout the year.
for instance, you may want to blog about the holidays during the end of the year. during allergy season throw in an article relating to how pollen is evil.
understand that people don’t search for christmas gift ideas in july and capitalize on keywords when they’re back in season.
7.  promote brick and mortar 
you shouldn’t only be promoting online stores! if you have a blog with a large local following try to reach out to the strictly brick and mortar stores in the area.
promoting them will draw a local audience and build strong, local relationships.

5 do’s and don’ts to dating a milf













there are so many right and wrong things to do when getting into a relationship with an older woman. although it can be very nerve-wracking at first, it’s important to stay cam, have confidence and treat her like royalty because she’s been alive long enough to know how she wants to be treated.
1. do wine & dine her:
even if the relationship starts out sexual at first, that doesn’t mean the effort should stop strictly in the bedroom. keep her attention and making her feel sexy not only in the sheets but at the finest restaurants your wallet can afford.
make sure you’re regularly showing her off to the world whether it be at the latest and hottest events or a nice night out to express how much your relationship means to her.
2. do not call her mommy:
unless that’s a personal fetish of hers, you might want to refrain from treating her like a mom and even going as far as calling her one. she shouldn’t be reminded in her sexual encounters and love life that she does indeed have kids, i’m sure she already knows that already.
steer clear of your wording because you don’t want to ruin the moment or make her uncomfortable like there is the elephant in the room when you both know she is a mother.
3. do make her feel young:
whether it be with compliments or your actions, make sure you’re reminding her how sexy, beautiful and lucky you are for spending so much time with this woman. the better she feels about herself, the more love she is willing to give in return, which will definitely be in your favor.
whatever power you hold over her you can make her feel like a million bucks with your love because she is pursuing younger men to remind her of how young she felt back in the day.
4. do not act childish:
she’s already raised kids or currently raising them, so she doesn’t need another one to take care of. you will come off as childish which is very unattractive to women regardless of their age. make sure you have your shit together and can impress her with your mature and charming ways.
dating a milf will help you kick your old, immature habits so that you become a man that she needs as well as contributing to the world like a man should.
5. do experiment in bed:
she’s obviously had sex before since she gave birth to children but that doesn’t mean that she’s been blown away in the bedroom. if you’re trying to give her a night to remember to make sure you’re whipping out all your special moves, positions and feelings that she’s never felt before, so she will want to come back for more.
if she is as hot as a milf is considered you best believe other eligible men are pining after her lustfully as well so try to blow her away in the sheets and leave her wanting more.
