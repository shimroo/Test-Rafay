(1837-1907). â the daughters (with married names) were: â lettice matthews (1819-1888); caroline williams (1826-1873); rhoda walters (1830-1873); and sally lawrence (1835-?). at one time thay all sat around the same kitchen table.if you are descended from one of them, then you must be one of us, and we'd like to get to know you. â there is good evidence that â edwin and elizabeth's family, though widely scattered, had affection for each other. â after over a hundred years, one can still detect â the warmth in their surviving letters. â another clue is their frustrating practice of naming their children after their brothers and sisters. â anyway, if you're a hickman, please sign the guest book below.â â if you'd prefer to believe the early utah lawman/outlaw william adams hickman was the only hickman worth knowing about, prepare to be educated.even if you aren't a hickman, you're welcome to stay and explore the story of a very interesting american family. â  you will discover â how interesting they were as you click â the buttons to the left.â if you don't know where to begin, a guided tour of the hickman site is available if you click â the pink button at the top left corner of this page.â â more information is being added, so please plan to come back here again and look around.if you have or know of hickman-related web links, or if you have hickman information of any kind that could be added to these pages, please let me know. â  â  â  â  â  â  â  â last update: 13 august 2023.website designed at homestead™ create a website and list your business
