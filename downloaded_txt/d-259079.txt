what’s so uncommon about uncommon courtesy? welcome to my uncommonly interesting website with more than 200 different bingo games, concentration games and flashcard sets! my games are uncommonly unique! this site is also uncommon because it weaves together the phases of my life as a family therapist, stay at home mom, and once again as a family therapist who has returned to a professional life and is experiencing the joy of watching my children grow and become amazing adults. hence the name “uncommon courtesy” all of my games emphasize a positive outlook on life and enjoying every moment that you are given. thank you for being one of more than 1,000,000 people to visit my site since i began keeping track of the numbers!  enjoy! susan rempel
