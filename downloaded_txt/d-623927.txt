    "the nicest people in the world stay at the cameo rose!"﻿

stay longer where the land and views are worth the price of a stay, where guests may hike, cross-country ski or snowshoe miles of private trails in the woods and pines, past hills and rock formations and under 100 year old oaks... "so close to everything, yet so far from the stresses left behind" of airplane, train and freeway corridors, sirens and streetlights. enjoy 101 area things to do in south central, southern wisconsin.﻿
