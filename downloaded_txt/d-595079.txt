leadlight, glass fusing, mirrors & special commissioned services





leadlight / stained glass windows
flat glass - the use of coloured glass &/or hand painted kiln fired detailed work has always had it’s admirers





glass fusing
since the purchase of an old, second-hand kiln in 1986 to complete ecclesiastical repairs i have been learning & developing the kiln-craft required to accomplish what was outside the laws of flat glass.





 lead-light mirrors
the reflective qualities of my leadlight mirrors clear textured & coloured glasses that i have silvered  achieves a stunning image when set into a beautiful timber frame.





specialised commissions
specialised commissions that required a combination of advanced glass techniques such hand painted kiln fired, glass fusing and the use of glass in all its formats.









a master glass craftsman
design & construction of leadlight windows was the starting point but soon developed into the stained glass extension upon the purchase of an old second-hand kiln that would propel the work into new and exciting areas such as ecclesiastical work – new & restoration - & the developing skills to add hand painted & kiln fired detail to ‘on the bench’ commissions.
