we exist to display god's glory by
making disciples through the gospel of jesus christ.

wednesday7:00pmsunday9:15am 




we are a church that loves worshipping god through jesus christ. because we believe that god has revealed himself through his written word, we cherish the incremental, section-by-section teaching of the bible, and place it at the heart of our weekly meetings. come worship with us!
