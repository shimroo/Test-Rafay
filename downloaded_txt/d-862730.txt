balfe's
twenty-one 'continental' operas

balfe not only composed more than 20
  operas for london during the 19th century but he also created 21 operatic
  works with french, italian and/or german librettos with leading librettists
  such as, scribe, piave and kupelwieser. some of these works were augmented
  versions of his english operas reworked with recitatives, additional arias and
  scenes and ballets. others were original works. autograph scores and other
  music is available for most of these works, some of which have long been
  "deemed lost."

  balfe's relatively unknown international musical fame and foreign
  language operas which had their premieres or early performances in cities such
  as, paris, vienna, milan, palermo, trieste, berlin, leipzig, frankfurt,
  munich, madrid, lisbon, brussels, london, dublin, new york, boston and san
  francisco are detailed here for the first time in the following, along with

time-line:
1808-1824

1.1) balfe early days in dublin
michael w. balfe 'was born on  15 may 1808, at 10 pitt street
(changed to balfe street, in 1917),  dublin, ireland.  
 
young balfe demonstrated
significant musical abilities from an early age. in dublin he took violin and music lessons with
the well established musician james barton and composer william (rourke) rooke (1794-1847), and with
meadows in wexford.
1.2)
the child prodigy performs at the rotunda concert rooms, dublin










rotunda concert rooms, dublin in
the 19th century.


“balfe, a child prodigy
      first performed publicly on the violin at a concert in the  rotunda concert rooms (shown here) dublin on 30 may
      1817, at the age of nine. as far as it is known, this was his
      ‘debut’ concert.”
  other concerts quickly followed, at the crow street theatre and again at the rotunda
all with great success over the next few years. the young performer's first musical composition "the lover's
      mistake," was published in
      december 1822 by isaac willis, music publisher of, 7 westmoreland street,
      dublin and london.



on the death of his father early in january 1823, balfe left dublin for
london where he took music lessons with charles horn  (1786-1849) and horn's father "carl frederick horn (1762-1830). during this time he also participated in
selected concerts as a soloist on the violin.  his first concert was
in 1823, at drury lane when he performed a concerto for violin.


in march 1823 the 15 year old balfe participated in his first major concert in
london
shortly
thereafter,  balfe, joined the orchestra at the drury lane theatre, which was then under the
direction of fellow irishman tom cooke  (1782- 1848).

time-line:
1825-1834


2.1) in search
of a career
in 1825, balfe,  interested in broadening his studies
first went to paris where he was introduced to the great composer, 'luigi cherubini, (1760-1842).
he took lessons in composition with cherubini during this period. balfe also
spent the next few years in italy studying to be an operatic singer and a
composer.

while in milan in the summer of 1825 balfe was given an assignment to compose
the music for a "ballo pantomino serio" by the director of the teatro
canobbiana, an englishman by the name of joseph glossup (1793-1850).  the
ballo pantomino was called, il naufragio di la peyrouse by william (blewit)
barrymore (1759-1830) of the theatre royal, drury lane, london.

dissatisfied with his progress in italy balfe returned to paris in 1827 where he
went to see cherubini who introduced him to gioachino rossini
(1792-1868).  rossini then at his very zenith as a composer in europe took a personal interest in the young irishman and his musical and
vocal talents.  at rossini's invitation and after a period of vocal study
with giulio bordogni (1789-1856) balfe made his debut early in 1828 at the
 theatre des italiens  as
"figaro" in "il barbiere di siviglia,"
singing opposite  'henriette sontag  (1806-1854),  and other leading singers.

2.2) the
emerging singer and composer - italy

balfe a baritone, decided to return to italy
late in 1828.   towards the end of
december 1828, he was in milan where he sang in a concert. 'he then went on to
bologna where he became the guest of rossini's friend, 'marchese francesco
sampieri, an important patron of the arts and a composer, whom he had
met in paris. 
here he
met
the young soprano  'giulia grisi (1811-1869) 
 at the start of what would become
a brilliant career for the soprano in europe, russia and briefly america. "these two young vocalists,
balfe aged 21 and grisi 18 were immediately attracted to each other. they
enjoyed each others company and musical talents. balfe composed
a musical cantata for grisi to perform and another vocalist to perform. this early
relationship in  'italy developed into a life-long friendship. she was the premier soprano in london and paris for
decades and helped balfe with his career there as a composer. 
2.3) italy - 1829  
during this period
in italy, balfe composed his  first and only known “sinfonia” and a cantata
for two voices which giulia grisi and
the tenor francesco pedrazzi sang. balfe was also recognized by the prestigious
bologna 'academy of music, for his talents. he was made a
honorary lifetime member of the academy in the composer category.


balfe's only known "sinfonia -
composed in 1829 in bologna - instruments page no. 2 of 88 pages.
after
bologna, balfe moved south, to palermo, in sicily where he had an operatic
engagement and also composed his first opera,  i
rivale di se stessi at the request of  the manager of the teatro
carolina in palermo.  he subsequently sang in several operas including the part of valdeburgo in  bellini's opera
"la straniera" at the  teatro carolino in palermo.
the next several years were spent
as a singer and
a composer of operas. by 1833, he had composed three (3) operas which had been produced
at palermo(1829), i rivali di se stessi; pavia(1831), un avvertimento
ai gelosi and at the important teatro carcano, milan (1833), enrico iv al
passo della marna in which both balfe and his wife lina sang principal
roles.

the teatro carcano, milan where
balfe's third opera, enrico iv al passo della marna had its premiere.

it was also during this
time (1831) while in milan that he first met and later married (in 
lugano, switzerland), lina
roser
 
 (1810-1888), 
  who was then
singing 
in bellini, donizetti and rossini operas and the works of other composers at, the teatro carcano in milan
and the teatro riccardi  in bergamo.
balfe and his new wife, lina
roser-balfe were both in the milan area during such historic moments, as the
premiers of bellini's norma (december
1831) and la sonnambula (march
1831), and possibly,
donizetti's anna bolena (december
1830).
   during the early 1830s balfe and his wife, also kept up a 
busy schedule performing in operas by  bellini, pacini, ricci, donizetti, rossini and others in places such as, venice,  milan, trieste, bergamo, mantua, parma, piacenza, turin, varese, pavia, novara,
and no doubt, other places in northern italy. 
2.4) maria malibran
& balfe at la
scala, milan
in may 1834 balfe made his debut at la scala, milan,
singing opposite his friend, (from paris) the renowned mezzo-soprano,  'maria malibran
 (1808-1836),
in rossini's  "otello." "the performances were so successful that they gave
repeat performances in october of the same year at 
la scala with the same cast.

3. balfe and maria malibran in venice



 balfe sang with maria malibran again, this time
in venice at the teatro la fenice. this was early in 1835. malibran also sang norma
there in april 1835 with lina roser balfe singing adalgisa.

it was
during this time she also agreed to sing a "benefit" performance of bellini's la sonnambula (with
balfe at count rodolfo and the tenor lorenzo bonfigli as elvino) at the teatro emeronittio
for the manager, gallo. to show his
appreciation, gallo renamed his theatre "teatro m. f. g.
malibran" (maria felicia garcia-malibran) in recognition of her generosity.
this turned out to be a sensational performance, with malibran receiving over 30
curtain calls.

the theatre still retains the
malibran name today, in remembrance 
of that long ago eventful night in april 1835 when
malibran and balfe sang together in bellini's beautiful opera in venice.;

april 1835, in venice with
maria malibran in the title role and "guglielmo balfe" as count

during this period malibran recognized
balfe's emerging musical talents as a composer. she called him the  "english rossini." 
given his musical skills. he
in turn committed to write an opera for her they talked about  hamlet
as the subject and later, esmeralda (hunchback of notre dame
story) however, they decided to postpone the project until a time in the future.
london would be the location where balfe would compose his new opera for
malibran in 1836.


3.0)
return to london
balfe returned to london in
may

1835, with his wife lina and their firstborn child, louisa "gigia" as
they called her, where he performed at a concert with lablache, tamburini, rubini and grisi
and others, at  vauxhall gardens.  
3.1) 
it was shortly after this
period that balfe completed his first opera for london. his london debut
as an operatic composer took place, in october 1835 with the premiere of what
was to be his highly successful,
       "the siege
of  rochelle"  at the theatre royal,
 drury lane.  
3.2) this was the start of balfe's brilliant
      career as a composer of operatic works for london. he was 27 years old!3.3)
maria malibran  premieres balfe's  "the maid of artois" london 1836
his initial success was quickly followed by another opera

 " 'the maid of artois " which he composed to fulfill his promise to his good friend, "maria malibran" who performed in 
 the premiere on may 27, 1836 at drury lane theatre in
london. the presence of malibran created a great financial success'. 'tragically,
the renowned malibran died the following september age 28, in manchester as a result of
an earlier horse-riding accident.   balfe was devastated when he
heard the new.it also appears that the last complete opera the great prima donna
sang was one composed by balfe, the maid of artois.

along with his success as
a composer of operas, balfe continued to sing in opera and concerts in the
1830s.






balfe sang in two mozart operas in london
in the late 1830's.
3.4)

"falstaff
"
'in 1838 balfe composed
his first  italian opera for london', "falstaff"
based on the shakespeare play, "the merry wives of windsor." the
italian libretto was written by an experienced london based translator of operas for leading
composers, s. manfredo maggioni (1810-1870?)

london, july 1838. ©basil walsh  

the great luigi lablache was in the title role with
grisi,  rubini and tamburini creating the other principal parts the opera was very successful. this same group of singers 
had created bellini's beautiful opera, 
i puritani, in paris 
three years earlier, in 1835,
also with great success. the
librettist was s. manfredo maggioni.


   
balfe falstaff librettist,s. manfredo maggioni, who also worked with verdi on songs and translated many opera scores from french to italian for the london stage.
maggioni was a close friend of verdi's wife, giuseppina (strepponi) verdi. he is mentioned in her correspondance.

3.5) first
return visit

in addition to dublin he also traveled to other places in ireland, cork being
one of the cities.

time-line:
1841-1850
4.1) the london theatre manager
balfe
turned theatre manager in london in 1841, for the purpose of creating a national
english opera organization in britain. queen victoria supported the venture
to create a permanent national operatic group at the lyceum
theatre on the strand.
 this
venture was quite unsuccessful for a variety of reasons not the least of which
was the lack of support balfe received from his fellow composers who were
supposed
to write new operas for the occasion, and didn't. however, additionally balfe's managerial and financial skills did not measure-up either. 
he went bankrupt  after six months. 
disgusted
with the entire endeavor he
announced from the stage of the lyceum that he would never venture into theatre management
again.  shortly afterwards he left for paris, where he gave concerts with the help
of érard the piano manufacturer. he later received a commission
to write a new opera, for the opera comique. it would be his first
opera for paris.
4.2) the new operatic composer in paris 1843.


  

            
balfe's first
french opera, le puits d'amour  premiered
early in 1843 in paris. ©basil walsh


balfe went
on to compose several other operas for paris.  his
success in paris gave him great international recognition at a level never previously experienced by any british
composer.  
4.3) a
new opera for london the bohemian girl - his most successful work

after
about a year and a half in paris balfe returned to london where he introduced an
english version of his successful french opera,

under the title of "geraldine
-  the lover's well" in august 1843.
  a few months later,
his most famous and most lasting opera,  "'the bohemian girl,"   was first
produced at the theatre royal, drury lane on november 27, 1843.  balfe composed
most of this work at his home in central london;
although it's
quite possible that some of work on the score was initially done in paris earlier in the year.

"after the highly
successful run of over 100 nights at drury lane, performances of 'the
bohemian girl"   were soon mounted in:  new york 1844; dublin 1844, philadelphia 1844,
 vienna (with a german libretto) 1846, sydney 1846, prague 1847, stockholm 1849, berlin 1850,
trieste, brescia, verona & bologna (with an italian libretto) in 1854, in zurich 1854, amsterdam 1855, rouen
1862 (french libretto), gothenburg 1865, paris 1868/9,
toronto 1874, new orleans 1876, mexico 1884 and in cape town in 1887, etc., etc.

           

4.4)
the bohemian girl -  performed the world over.
  for more than 150 years, balfe's
most popular opera, "'the bohemian girl,"   has been performed with remarkable success in the english speaking world of, america, australia, britain, canada, ireland, new
zealand and elsewhere.   a cd recording of the opera is
available. see recordings section below.  it received a concert
performances in carnegie hall in new york as recently as 2003 and in dublin and
in the uk in 2008.


4.5) vienna, pest
(budapest), danzig, munich, linz and stuttgart - 1844-1850s 


balfe's
opera die vier haimonskinder  (translated from his 1844 french work, les quatre fils
aymon) was performed with great acclaim during this
period in these cities. it later was staged in leipzig and other cities and
towns and again in vienna over a period of many years.


  

balfe's opera,  die vier
haimonskinder (les quatre fils aymon) was performed in vienna, berlin, leipzig, frankfurt, prague and other german speaking cities throughout the 19th century. ©basil walsh




4.6) paris
1845 - balfe's opera l'etoil de seville 
towards
the end of 1845 balfe returned to paris to prepare for the premiere of his new
opera which was written specially for the paris opera. 



this was a historical
moment as it was the first time a "british" musician had been invited to compose a
new opera for this important venue. 
and the
great pianist, frederic chopin

 and most of the leading
composers of the period. chopin recorded the event
somewhat negatively in his
writings to family members in poland, complaining about the balfe work being
given priority over a meyerbeer opera!



l'etoile de seville, paris
opera,  december 1845 - 15 performances with a stellar cast 

balfe's
cast included such distinguished singers as, tenor italo gardoni, mezzo-soprano, rosine
stoltz, soprano maria nau, and the baritone paul barroilhet. the opera was given 15 performances with
considerable success. it was later
performed in brussels and then
translated into german for  vienna,
however it does not appear to have
ever been performed there.
4.7) london - 1846-1852 - balfe director at the italian opera at her majesty's theatre, london;

balfe was appointed the director of her
majesty's theatre in london in 1846. it was a position he held for the next
seven years until 1852. during that time he introduced several of verdi's opera
to london along with other local operatic premieres. 

he also premiered his own work, i quattro fratelli an augmented
version of his very successful, french opera les quatre fils aymon (paris
1844)



  

 in august 1851, balfe
premiered his three act opera buffa,  i quattro fratelli at london's
italian opera with significant new dynamic vocal music written for his star
dramatic coloratura soprano, sophie cruvelli.  the opera was a remarkable
success. the libretto was by his friend, s. manfredo maggioni (1808-1870?)

4.8  balfe with
giuseppe verdi and jenny lind in
london 1846-47
balfe
was also the principal conductor for the italian opera at her majesty's theatre,
london. he conducted jenny lind's (1820-1887) london debut in opera
and most of her subsequent performances in that city
 and in dublin.
balfe also conducted the
local london premiere of  the young italian composer, giuseppe verdi's (1813-1901),

first successful opera, nabucco.

giuseppe verdi circa 1847

when giuseppe verdi
first arrived in london to conduct his new opera, i masnadieri, with
jenny lynn and luigi lablache, balfe worked with him at rehearsals. later when
the italian composer left london after conducting two performances, balfe took
up the baton to finish the run of the italian composer's new opera.


4.9 "irish
famine" relief concert


early in the year 1847, benjamin lumley the london impresario and balfe
mounted a special concert at her majesty's theatre for the benefit of famine
related distressed irish people. the concert raised  £2,000. various
members of the aristocracy were also directly involved as part of the fund raising
committee and funds distribution. the money was distributed in ireland.

century.

5.2)
 cantata
- inno delle nazioni 
- 
(london 1851)










in london
in 1851 in honor of the upcoming great international exhibition in
london, balfe composed an extraordinary

cantata titled, inno delle nazioni -

onore alla gran bretagna in
which the nine (9) vocal parts were sung by nine leading females singers each
representing a country. the accompaniment was piano, harp and horn.

the bohemian girl  -
performed in english, german, italian and french. and other languages.



an italian adaptation and translation of
 " 'the bohemian girl" titled, "la zingara"  was
mounted in trieste in 1854. it was a great success. performances quickly followed in other italian cities,
bologna, bergamo, brescia, and verona. 




 

 later  la zingara 
was performed in: 
london (1856), dublin (1858), new york (1858) and in boston and san francisco.  a
german language version,  "die
zigeunerin"  premiered in vienna,
in 1846. it was later heard in berlin, frankfurt (balfe's friend, jenny lind attended the frankfurt performance),



 hamburg,
darmstadt, munich, stuttgart, budapest, leipzig 
and
other cities. 






in 1862 a four-act french version "la
bohemienne"  
 premiered in rouen, in france with the very young (20 years old) future great
french composer, jules massenet conducting. the
star of the evening however, was celestine galli-marie (role of the gypsy
queen) who a number of years
later went on to create
thomas'  mignon (1866), and bizet's carmen
(1875). a revised augmented version of balfe's opera reached paris

the success of the
bohemian girl was unprecedented for opera in the 19th century. the
only other work that was close to it  in terms of popularity around the world
was verdi's  ernani  (1844).
5.3) the
composer in st. petersburg, moscow,
vienna and trieste



'the years 1852-53 saw balfe
travel to danzig to visit his eldest daughter louisa "gigia" (balfe) behrens
and her family after which he traveled by coach to st. petersburg in russia for
concerts.  he later went on
to moscow for more concerts, after which he returned to danzig for a rest before
going on to vienna to direct a german version of his opera keolanthe. in
1854 he went to trieste to premiere  la zingara. he also returned to russia in the 1860's.  

5.4) new
york - the academy of music -1854
strangely, 'balfe never
visited america, although there were strong rumors circulating in new york in
1854-5 that the composer was to become the director of the  academy of music on 14th street. 
however, nothing came of it. 
5.5) the successful
composer of 250 songs, several cantatas and at least one symphony      

balfe was
remarkably productive during these years, between composing operas he wrote
songs with text by some of the most famous poets of the time.  these
included, tennyson, longfellow, falconer, morris, rankin, kingsley,
      desmond ryan, guernsey, carpenter, and thomas moore were some of the poets and writers who penned the words for balfe songs.



5.6)
    popular songs/moore's irish melodies

over a 35 year
      period many of balfe's songs achieved great popularity for example songs
      such as,   "killarney" - "come into the garden maud"

    - " 'the sands of dee" - "trust her not" "the arrow and the song"
      "excelsior" - "margarita" - "there is a name i
      never breathe" - "the first kiss" - "the song of love
      & death" "good night! good night, beloved" etc. etc. 
    see the full lists of know balfe songs below.

 
  moore's
      irish melodies -
      in 1859 balfe was also contracted by the london music
      publisher, novello & co to update and complete a new arrangement of moore's irish melodies. it
    was an endeavor he very much enjoyed.  
5.7)
      cantatas





    in 1829 in bologna, balfe composed his first cantata. he specifically wrote
    it for his friend the future great soprano, giulia grisi, then aged 18. she
    performed it with the tenor
      francesco pedrazzi with much success. 
    



'he also composed at
      least eight other cantatas, one for the great singer maria malibran, and one for such other  illustrious singers as the mezzo-soprano, pauline
      viardot-garcia (malibran's sister) and the great tenor, gilbert duprez in paris in 1842.




the performers of this 1842 paris cantata (with harp, violin and piano)
were detailed in balfe's own handwriting on the opening page of the autograph score. ©basil walsh


 balfe 
      composed his better known cantata  mazeppa later on

      in 1862 to words by j. rankin.

    


5.8)
      the
      composer's only known symphony



      balfe composed his one and only
      known 

 sinfonia  in 1829.

 the music for this (88 pages) and other early works has
      recently been discovered in europe and copies obtained. hopefully these important pieces will get an airing
      some day soon.

    





5.9)  the astounding
michael william balfe -
summary,
the years, 1835-60



balfe's output and
energy during the years 1835-1860 was astounding.
some years he was actually composing operas for london, paris and/or vienna at the same
time, or had two of his opera running in london while he was conducting
other composer's works there.  he was simply amazing.

balfe's
personal side



6.1) 
marriage/family

'balfe was married for
almost 40 years to lina roser-balfe. she survived him by 18 years, dying in
london in 1888. 

they had two sons and two daughters. the
younger son, edward died in infancy. the other son named michael
william after his father,  survived his parents by many years spending most
of his life between london and new york.  he died in london in 1915.

6.2)
balfe's wife - lina (magdalena) roser balfe (1810-1888) - also an important
singer



balfe's
wife lina was born in budapest (pest), hungary of an austrian father in 1810,
and perhaps an austrian mother. it appears that her mother possibly died during
childbirth, as she was raised by austrian foster parents, the vogels.  her father, franz de paula roser (1779-1830)
who was working as a musician, theatre
manager and composer in pest when she was born. the father had been a pupil of
w. a. mozart during the year 1789, when he was a child. he was also a composer of significance in vienna
where more than 60 of his operettas were performed during his lifetime. 



lina a
soprano, was an excellent singer, performing in milan from around 1829 and
afterwards in venice, bergamo, parma, mantua, turin, varese and elsewhere in
italy in the 1830s.  she studied with one of mozart's sons, karl t.
mozart in milan during 1828/29.

shortly after the death of her husband, michael w. balfe in 1870, lina balfe
donated her large collection of his original scores and music to the british
museum/library. the balfe collection which is very extensive is held by the
british library today. the listing of the collection can be viewed online.
copies of  musical scores can also be ordered online. 
6.3) daughter - louisa
balfe-behrend (1832-1869) 
balfe's first daughter louisa
"gigia," was born in italy (probably in milan) in 1832. in 1850 she married a well established
danzig merchant 28 year old maximiliam behrend in london and lived in danzig and berlin, before
the family eventually moved to england. 
'louisa behrend (balfe) died
in london in 1869. 'there were eight children from the louisa/max behrend marriage.   descendants of this branch of the
balfe/behrend family exists today, in britain and elsewhere. 
6.4)
son
- michael
w. balfe jr. (1836(?)
-1915)  



balfe's
son who
was born in london circa late 1836 (?), was not successful in his efforts to follow in his father's
footsteps as a composer. he was married in london in 1863.  he later spent
several years in new york where he
went with his wife, norah and their young daughter, maud. his wife later died and he remarried. their family grew, they had another daughter,
victoria and two sons, michael william and william each born in new york (brooklyn). while
in new york he worked not too successfully as a, "fitter" and later an insurance sales
person.  he died in london at an infirmary in 1915 aged 79.



6.5) daughter - victoire
balfe-de frias (paris 1837?-1871) 






©basil walsh 




 balfe's
      youngest daughter, victoire (shown here circa 1861) is reported to have
      been born in paris in september, 1837.
      she studied singing with her father and with the noted teacher manuel garcia in
      london.  she had a short but successful career as a soprano in london, dublin,
      paris, turin and milan.  


 while on a visit to russia with her
      father she met the eccentric british ambassador, 



 
 55 year old, sir john f.
      crampton
      whom she married in  st. petersburg in 1860. he was 32 years her
 senior. the marriage was nor a success. however, a court order and a papal decree eventually annulled the marriage.

 subsequently, she
      remarried 

the 29 year old
      duke defrias, of burgos, a spanish nobleman then residing in
      madrid. victoire died in madrid in 1871. there were three children from this
marriage.

balfe's
memory is honored
7.1) the composer
remembered in london & dublin
today,
a large marble statue of balfe stands on a pedestal in the center of the
entrance foyer to the 'theatre royal drury lane, london, (see below), the very same theatre where balfe experienced so
much success with his operas, during the nineteenth-century.  the
statue was placed there in 1874 by a group of balfe friends and followers.

the balfe statue which is still in place at the drury lane
theatre is flanked by three other similar statutes of "immortals" of the british theatre,
shakespeare, garrick and keane.
in 1879 a stained glass window, honoring michael w. balfe was
installed in st. patrick's cathedral, dublin. the window is still there today. a
plaque was installed in westminster abbey, london honoring the composer in 1882.
see image below.

7.2 balfe's final work



balfe had nearly completed his final opera, 
the
knight of the leopard - based on sir walter scott's work, "the talisman,"
in 1870 when he died. 








 'his friend michael costa finalized the work.
it was given an italian libretto (g. zaffira) and title and first performed as il talismano 
in london in 1874.  it had a stellar cast in soprano christine nilsson, and tenor
italo campanini. michael costa conducted it. 

 the opera achieved great success and was
praised highly by the critics as balfe's best work on a grand italian scale. the
opera was later performed in dublin, new york and in monte carlo in 1918 and elsewhere.

   balfe's songs & concert
arias
in addition to 28
operas, balfe also composed about 250 or more songs (including several concert arias
with italian text) during his career which spanned almost 50 years as a
composer. the majority of these were published in london, where balfe resided for most
of his life. 

the following is a list of known songs that were published during his lifetime.
there obviously will be more songs added as they are identified. there were many songs that appear to
have been published after his death in october 1870, in which balfe's music was
used with a different or new text. these songs have not been included in the following compilation,
as their authenticity is perhaps somewhat questionable, since the composer was
dead when they were first published.

generally, balfe operatic arias/ballads have been excluded from this listing.
although some operatic numbers did in fact take on "a life of their
own"  as "songs" on the concert circuit. a list of the principal arias in each balfe opera is provided in
the author's recently published michael w. balfe biography.

10.2
trieste - james joyce and balfe



 "trieste,
italy with its strong middle-eastern influence has long been a very
cosmopolitan, multi-racial city ever since the habsburgs declared it a
"free city" in 1719. over the centuries, the arts, including music have
flourished there, particularly in the nineteenth-century." under habsburg rule,
trade also boomed, and the city's port became vienna's gateway to the mediterranean
and the middle-east for almost two-hundred years.
  the
      irish writer james joyce's"
      made reference to michael balfe and his music in a number of his
      books and stories, including ulysses, dubliners and finnegan's wake. he seemed to have a special feeling
      and interest for the composer and his works. 
   perhaps a little known linkage between balfe and joyce
      that centers on trieste might
      have given joyce a certain partially towards his fellow dubliner. the following provides
      the details.
balfe and joyce were both born in dublin, balfe in 1808 and joyce in
      1882, 74 years apart. both had fathers that were interested in music. both
      men grew to have a deep interest in italian opera. both had excellent
      singing voices, joyce a tenor, balfe a baritone. 
they also experienced a number of
      other things in common, not the least of which
      was a strong association with the city of trieste.
   joyce arrived in trieste on october 20, 1904, exactly 34 years to
      the very day after balfe died (october 20, 1870), outside london.  joyce lived in trieste for about 12-14 years. he was twenty-two when he arrived
      there. 
      during this time he wrote, a portrait of the artist as a young
      man, most of dubliners and some of ulysses and
      a play called exiles. 
in total, balfe spent about eight years in italy. first in 1825 for a short
      period, before going to paris.  at the end of 1828 when he was twenty
      years old he returned to italy (he spent time in trieste during this
      period), to become a singer and a composer, before
      returning to london in 1835.  
early in 1854, balfe once again returned to italy, this time
      to trieste. he was now a famous composer of successful operas for london,
      paris and vienna. on this visit he spent a little over a year in trieste
      directing and composing two operas.  
trieste  was ruled from vienna by the habsburgs when balfe was
      there. it was stilled ruled from vienna by the habsburgs when joyce went
      to live there in 1904. 
 shortly after balfe's arrival in
      trieste, he premiered (february 1854),
      the italian version of his most successful
      work, the bohemian girl  as la zingara. la
      zingara became very popular in italy, britain, ireland and america
      during the 19th century.joyce
      of course refers to the bohemian girl a number of times in
      his works and also other balfe works.
      as can be seen the two artists had a number of things in common. joyce was probably
      aware of some of these facts about balfe so perhaps he felt somewhat partial towards his fellow
      dubliner and his music, and gave him preference in his writings. we'll
      never really know for sure.

the two-hundred anniversary of
balfe's birth occurred in 2008. balfe was an important composer
during the 19th century and beyond.  his legacy is really his music, not
necessarily the staged operas themselves.   
a number of important events took place in
ireland, the uk and elsewhere in celebration of the bicentenary event. these included the
publication of a new biography of the composer (see details above), various articles, operatic and
concert performances, radio and tv broadcasts and recording of balfe works.
