welcome to
crow cams


for over 40 years crow cams have maintained the most advanced cam development and cnc grinding facilities in australia which have been used by car companies and our most successful racers to great effect.

over the past 2 years crow cams have taken these 
facilities to the next level with new valve train simulation software developed to produce profiles that offer aggressive acceleration and maximum area under the cam without compromising valve spring lift or quiet valve train operation.


the new crow next gen cam profiles deliver more .200 duration for improved mid-range power and torque over other cam profiles with similar 050 duration and lift. crow next gen profiles are extremely smooth and accurate over the lobe nose to minimize stress on valve springs for improved service life.

                                crow cams' unique next gen cam design and cnc grinding technology is applied to a huge range of hydraulic lifter camshafts, solid lifter, camshafts, hydraulic roller camshafts and solid roller camshafts for maximum torque and power in street or race applications.
