history in the making...


nov. 4th, 2008 at 11:43 pm



 


imagine_kdgit is done!what an amazing moment in american history.  i can't ever remember an election as electrifying and where people were lining the streets the way they have in this one.  kudos to john mccain for such a gracious concession speech.  i sincerely do hope that he remains active because he does have a lot to offer this country and i do respect all of his former service.  if not for the whole palin fiasco, i probably would have voted for him, but palin?  seriously?!?  seriously tho, not.now sarah, please go back to alaska and be a front porch "maverick" .

it was bound to happen...

imagine_kdgmy daughter has discovered boys.well, at least i can take comfort in the fact that her first "crush" is on someone that i don't need to really worry about.  it's highly unlikely that joe jonas will be calling my house any time in the near future.and so it begins...a former shaun cassidy freak

if ever there was a time to vote...


nov. 2nd, 2008 at 6:49 am



 


imagine_kdgthis is the election to do it.this is not going to be one of those "vote for my candidate" stump speeches.  i have my presidential ticket selected but i'm not going to force my choice down your throat - rather, i am only asking you all to exercise your right, and your responsibility, to participate in this election.  history will be made on tuesday... and not just a little byline in our grandkids social studies textbooks.  either way, this election will be a turning point in american politics and what could be better than participating in something that those grandkids will, no doubt, ask about years from now when they're studying this election in high school?i will be taking the divine miss in to the voting booth with me again this year - she's energized by elections, mesmerized by the fact that everyone has a chance to help pick a president.  there is no greater gift that i can give her than a passion for -and a sense of belonging to- this great community that we call the united states of america. so vote people!!!!

one month in...


nov. 1st, 2008 at 8:41 am



 


imagine_kdgokay, so i've been doing this gym thing for four weeks...so far, i've logged in about 15 hours on the elliptical, 4 hours on the treadmill (this bores me, i think i'm going to cut the treadmill out), a bunch of upper body circuit stuff and some freeweights.  i'm averaging 5.5 days per week at the gym at anywhere from 90 - 120 minutes each trip.for my efforts, i've lost only five pounds (grrrrrrrrrrrr) however there is some pretty noticeable muscle development so (rational mind talking here) considering that muscle weighs more than fat, i shouldn't be discouraged by the numbers... (right?)but, i am.so monday i'm starting with a personal trainer.  the gym offers some great "butt and gut" classes which would suit my needs perfectly, but they're offered at either 5:30 am or 11:00am, neither of which fits my schedule.  if i had to make a complaint about this gym, it would be the fact that the majority of classes are scheduled during the 8:00 - 5:00 timeslot when most people are at work.  great for the stay-at-home crowd, not so great for me!  now true, i'm not at work at 5:30am, but i'm not exactly available then either.  taking that class would get me back to the house without enough time to get the divine miss up and ready for the bus.  and yeah, she should be able to get herself up and ready, but she's a pre-teen (read: she requires a sonic explosion to pry her out of bed on school days... weekends, she's up before the birds).sigh...speaking of the divine miss, she and her bff were "nerds" for halloween.  kinda scary how it seemed to suit her / them.

that old grey mare, she ain't what she used to be...


oct. 25th, 2008 at 4:02 pm



 


imagine_kdgthe divine miss had a high school musical 3 movie night and sleepover with her cousins last night, so i had an opportunity to get to the gym relatively early today.  i arrived at 8:00am, hit the elliptical for 45 minutes, did the upper body circuit and then noticed that a step class was just about to start..."why not" i thought to myself ... "i used to do step all the time before the divine miss was born"...well, let's just say "that old grey mare, she ain't what she used to be"...after 15 minutes, my knees were screaming...after 20 minutes, my thighs were groaning...after 30 minutes, i noticed that my shoes were too tight cause i could feel the blood moving through my feet...after 35 minutes, i thought i was going to die, but dammit, they'll take me outta here on a gurney cause i'm way too embarrassed to quit mid way and moron that i am, i didn't pick a spot close enough to the door to sneak out...an hour later, i finally got to leave... threw on my sweatshirt and ran out the door to my car, where i promptly engaged in a little yelling match with myself ... rational me:  "wtf were  you thinking?!?denial me : "i thought that i used to love step classes and i never had a problem before"rational me: "yeah moron, that was 12 years ago... if you haven't noticed, you're old now"denial me: "i can do this, i'm not that old. rational me:  "uh yeah, you are"denial me "fu"and finally, my body chimed in...knees: "oh, don't worry, we'll fu up later"thighs:  "we're with the knees, just wait til she tries to get up the stairs"ankles: "we kinda feel sorry for the old mare, but we're on board with both of ya...."i'm a little wary of sitting down for too long in fear of not being able to stand back up.aging sucks people, enjoy your 20's while ya got them.  if you don't, you'll spend your 40's trying to get them back (and your joints will punish you for it)

yay for workout partners!


oct. 19th, 2008 at 7:00 pm



 


imagine_kdgi've become quite friendly with one of the other "cheer moms" lately.  she has two daughters in the program, one a year older than my daughter, one a year younger.  the kids have been taking private tumbling lessons together for a few weeks and have forged a nice little friendship.  last week, she asked why i wasn't staying for all of the practices anymore and i told her that i had joined this local gym and resumed my old exercise addiction.  i told her about the facilities for kids and today she told me that she went ahead and got a family membership.  the girls were so excited that they can work out together while the moms work out downstairs.i am thrilled to have someone to go with.  exercise is great, a natural high - some people drink or do other things to get the high... i sweat.  i push myself for that extra 10 minutes on the machines and then it feels like i'm walking on air for an hour.  it's an adrenaline thing i suppose, but it's my vice.so starting wednesday, we've got a daily "date" at the gym, the moms and the three kids!  the kids gym is complete with an appropriately sized circuit and cardio stuff, so it's a great introduction to daily exercise.  monday and tuesdays are cheer practice, i've already arranged with my daughters bff's mom to drop the kids off on those days, she'll do the pick-ups so that i can go to the gym while they practice and then wednesday - sunday will be with my new partner!yay!this morning, i started at the gym at about 8 - worked out for a solid two hours, then took my little lady hiking at fahnstock state park for 2 hours.  she enjoyed it much more than she thought she would and asked if we can start doing it more regularly in the spring.  sounds like a great idea to me!  she even wants to go camping because she saw a few tents pitched around the lake.

week two...


oct. 16th, 2008 at 8:22 pm



 


imagine_kdgoff to a little slower of a start this week.  i made the gym early sunday and monday mornings (yay for long weekends!), tuesday i took off to go to parent team practice and wednesday i wasn't able to go because the divine miss didn't feel like working out, so i was stuck waiting on someone to watch her.  dave didn't get home until after 9 and by that time, the debate was on.  today i was determined, so after she got off the bus, i told her that she had 30 minutes to practice the sax and then we were heading to the gym.  she whimpered and whined a bit about it being "boring" to wait for me to exercise before i had to point out to her that the vast majority of my time is spent  waiting for her at practice and/or competitions.  she finally got the point, loaded up one of her backpacks and off we went.so, so far for the week...2 hours on the elliptical1 hour on the treadmill3 rounds of the circuit.the most encouraging thing right now is that i am not as winded as i originally thought i would be while doing the cardio stuff... i am not having any difficulties, do not need to take any breaks and have enough energy to keep pushing.no additional pounds lost, however my legs are starting to look familiar again...i'm gonna kick booty this weekend, at least 2 hours a day and i am now sufficiently confident that i can handle one of the hour long cardio-weight training classes, so i'm going to take my first one saturday morning!

imagine_kdga simple song by alan jackson..."where were you when the world stopped turning that september day?out in the yard with your wife and children,or workin on some stage in la?did you stand there in shockat the sight of that black smoke risin' against that blue sky?did you shout out in anger and fear for your neighbor?or did you just sit down and cry?did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones?pray for the ones who dont know?did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble?and sob for the ones left below?did you burst out in pride for the red white and blue?and the heros who died just doin what they do?did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer,and look at yourself and what really matters?*where were you when the world stopped turning that september day?teaching a class full of innocent children?driving down some cold interstate?did you feel guilty cause you're a survivor?in a crowded room did you feel alone?did you call up your mother and tell her you love her?did you dust off that bible at home?did you open your eyes and hope it never happened?close your eyes and not go to sleep?did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages?speak to some stranger on the street?did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow?go out an buy you a gun?did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'and turn on 'i love lucy' re-runs?did you go to church and hold hands with some stangers?stand in line and give your own blood?did you just stay home and cling tight to your family?thank god you had somebody to love?"never forget...
