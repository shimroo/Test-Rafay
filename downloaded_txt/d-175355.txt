the charley project

the charley project profiles over 16,000 “cold case” missing people mainly from the united states. it does not actively investigate cases; it is merely a publicity vehicle for missing people who are often neglected by the press and forgotten all too soon. a person must have been missing for at least one year to be listed; see the faq for additional information on the site, its goals, and its founder/administrator.
