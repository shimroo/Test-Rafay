take the edinformatics challenge 


edinformatics has  designed a two part -end of year- 8th grade science test that accesses both "knowledge and concepts" (part i), and "reasoning and analysis skills" (part ii). most of the science material used for the test is consistent with current intermediate school textbooks. several questions require more rigorous mathematics that is contained within the newly initiated common core standards and the  ngss (next generation science standards).
