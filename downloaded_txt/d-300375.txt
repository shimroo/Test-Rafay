welcome to lion of judah church!







greetings 

greetings in the name of our lord jesus christ. we welcome you to our website and pray that you will be blessed as you read about the awesomeness of god. jesus loves you and we pray that if you are looking for answers for your life today - that you will ask the lord jesus christ to come into your heart and make you a new creation. today could be the first day of the rest of your life.

all are welcomed! 

we are living in a time where we have so much of everything except real peace and real happiness. everyone is searching for something real in their lives. jesus is real! jesus loves you! jesus wants to live in your heart today. only when you accept the real thing will you find the true meaning of life. at the lion of judah, assemblies of god church we have our doors opened for everyone. we welcome all religious backgrounds, all cultures, all races, all colors and all lifestyles to come and experience the true love of jesus christ.
