stone harbor & avalon new jersey









sea isle city


 

						and



ocean city







stone harbor and 
                        



avalon share this south jersey island which is known as 
                        "seven mile beach".  it  is seven miles long but only three or four city blocks wide.
                        





avalon
 

is located at the northern end and stone harbor 
                        at the southern end. 
                        when you get to 80th street, avalon stops and stone harbor begins and 
                        continues on until the 




hereford inlet.  geographically it 
                        is half-way between 
                        





ocean city


 and
 




cape may.  
						
stone harbor is "the seashore at its best".



stone harbor has an 
                        exclusive  

shopping district known for its quaint shops that appeal to all 
                        whether looking for  




trendy boutiques,
                        unusual 
                        specialty gifts, 


salons or just souvenirs 
						 


. this resort is also famous for its great
                        



restaurants 
                        and spectacular beach front homes.  avalon also has great
                        



shopping
 

and excellent 
                        restaurants.
where other resorts are dotted 
                        with "cookie cutter" condos block after block, stone 
                        harbor has maintained its charming quaint town look with 
                        mostly single family 
                        homes - some absolutely magnificent!

another nice feature is that the homes sit on good sized 
                        lots which are beautifully maintained. 
                        tree lined streets also add to the charm.  stone harbor boasts some of the most expensive real estate in southern 
                        new jersey.



beautiful, protected
                        



beaches 
                        extend the 7 mile length of the island 
                        and because the island is only a few blocks wide, you can walk from 
            the beach to ice cream parlors and gift shops. stone harbor 
                        is a clean, quiet, family resort where you can enjoy a casual, 
                        peaceful and relaxed seashore atmosphere. 
                        



beach tags
                        


are required and can be used in either stone 
                        harbor or avalon. you do not have to go far to find
                        

churches as there are many denominations 
                        represented in both stone harbor and avalon.




stone harbor vacationers do not have to become beach potatoes. 
            			
  

there 
            are many   




outdoor activities

 
in which they can participate such as the water sports or swimming,
            			


biking, 
            			



fishing, boating, 
            sailing, surfing, and jet skiing, or trying their hand at tennis 
            (courts at 97th and 82nd streets), volleyball 
            and golf. others may just enjoy being on the beach
            



collecting 
            shells, strolling at the water's edge or soaking up the rays of the 
            sun.  there is something for everyone. if you need more

playgrounds for the children are 
                        scattered all over the island, 
                        and the municipality itself runs supervised recreational 
            activities including basketball, soccer, baseball, and teen dances. 
                         

                        several quality




                        golf courses, 
						while not on the island, are easily reached from stone 
						harbor including the 



                        stone harbor golf club. 





if fine food, boating and socializing is 
                        your forte, then members can enjoy 
                        the stone harbor yacht club. our 
                        daughter had her wedding reception there and it was 
                        spectacular. besides everything else being wonderful - the sunset was magnificent.

                         

                         





stone harbor has the only heronry sponsored by a 
            municipality in the united states. 
            


the stone harbor bird sanctuary
            is registered as a national landmark by the national park service. 
            thousands of herons are nested safely here.



                        stone harbor relies heavily on the neighboring resort 
                        towns 
                        of wildwood, 





ocean city

cape may
