doug kaufmann's know the cause 



doug kaufmann’s mission is to counsel both lay and professional audiences on achieving optimum health by avoiding poisonous fungal byproducts, called “mycotoxins.” unbeknownst to most healthcare providers, humans are exposed to these mycotoxins in our medication, food, and air supply. excess exposure is linked to many mammalian symptoms and diseases, as published extensively in medical journals. our job is to assure that you know the cause.if this is your first time visiting know the cause we highly advise you start here. 












the center for disease control (cdc) has been instructing us for several years to "think fungus" when we have health problems.  



of course, i’ve been trying to get our doctors to do this for nearly 50 years, so i was thrilled that the cdc finally agrees!  while i’m always going to always recommend that you work with a knowledgeable healthcare provider when searching for “the cause” of your misery.  since fungi must eat to maintain residency inside your body, why not start with starving them?  that is how the kaufmann diets might help you.  if your healthcare provider won’t furnish antifungal medications, ask about using safe and inexpensive nutritional supplements like omega 3 fatty acids, resveratrol, caprylic acid or many others while you are following the kaufmann diet.  what do you have to lose?  after many decades of clinical and research nutritional work, i’ve learned what you may soon learn. so often, the cause is fungus, and the sufferer learns that fupo is a fitting acronym for their condition; fungus until proven otherwise!”
