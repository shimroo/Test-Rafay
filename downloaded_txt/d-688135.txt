history club creates new page!

the manasquan high school history club has been busy organizing all the old yearbooks. along the way, we found a bunch of old photos, notes, letters, and more, which we have put on display in the hallway.  we are also archiving all the issues of “the blue and gray”, “the clipper”, and “warrior”. these documents date back several decades and contain a wealth of historical information and photos. we encourage you to take a look and explore the rich history of our school!
