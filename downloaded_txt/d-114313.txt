new equipment



















chandler equipment co. started in february of 1969 when a few men, including mr. bill chandler, decided to start a fabrication shop for gainesville‘s booming poultry processing industry. a few years later the first chandler poultry litter spreader rolled off the line and the business began to grow. with the help of his wife, linda, and many employees still working with us today, the chandler brand began to gain notoriety up the east coast and into the midwest.
throughout the 1980s our product offering began to expand into the commercial fertilizer sector as sons brannon and barry inherited greater responsibility. nowadays chandler enlists the help of over 100 employees and has added a third generation in grandson jackson. our goal is and has always been to provide our customers with a superior quality product at a fair price, knowledgeable customer service, and our full support of the hardworking ag community.






 






customer testimonials



drove down from cleveland tn to pick up parts for our litter spreader.  greeted by tim in parts upon arrival.  parts we requested were ready to load and well packaged.  his superb in depth technical knowledge and friendly advice ensured we had everything we needed to get back into the field.  he even printed out some technical drawings we needed and we’re out in under 30 minutes.  great place and highly recommended.

i picked up a load from them. the shop guys and shop manager were really great to me being a newbie driver. they didn’t rush me – pointed out some things and we’re all positive and all were enjoying their jobs. nice to see a place that still exists with great working attitudes. i look forward to my next pick up there. steve was the best…thank y’all again.

for all your chandler spreader’s parts see my two friends dylan and vernon in the chandler equipment parts department. these two guys are friendly and knowledgeable about everything to do with chandler spreaders. they will go beyond the call of duty to help you get the parts you need at a price you can afford. each hand-crafted chandler spreader has several sprockets, bearings and chains that wear out from time to time. when time and money counts, call on these guys to get you just what you need, right on time.
