	 	hell rell - for the hell of it (album info)
	 	
    	


i don't know if hell rell will actually release his first studio album 'for the hell of it' on september 11th but right now that seems to be the plan."the reason why i named it for the hell of it is because i got the money, i didn’t do it for the money and i’m not doing it for the fame," hell rell explains. "i’m just doing it for the hell of it. whatever hell rell felt that day, that’s what, came out. if i was arguing with one of my bitches or whatever whatever, and i was mad that’s the type of mood i was in."the first single from 'for the hell of it' is "i shall proceed". i wonder what ruger was thinking that day.don't expect to wait this long for his next album,"my next album, i’mma sit down and come up with concepts and get deep into my brain and give you a piece of my life story," hell rell said. "this one is straight for the hell of it."labels: hell rell

	 	t.i. and jay-z - watch what you say
	 	
    	


nahright has the new t.i. with jay track, the track actually comes from hiphopdx and has the hiphopdx drops in it.  i share the opinion that many seem to have of this, 'jay hasn't sounded this good since....' maybe sean is really going out of his way to impress rihanna.  there is some talk that jay is going at wayne on this track, and maybe game a little. what do you guys think?t.i. and jay-z - watch what you say @ nahrightlabels: jay-z, t.i.

(thanks to trac for the picture)taken from the saint sabina web site:saint sabina puts up billboards targeting negative musicstarting today, twenty billboards will be going up throughout the city of chicago denouncing artists that demean women and perpetuate violence. some of the billboards are already posted.rev. michael pfleger, pastor of saint sabina church said, "if we are going to end the violence and the disrespect of women, we must fight every form of negativity, including the music industry."the billboards read: "stop listening to trash" naming ten present day disrespectful rappers.billboard locations:87th & vincennes 79th &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; normal79th & ada 74th & racine79th & ashland halsted &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; garfield103rd & wallace 79th & western119th & wallace 107th & michigan115th & forest 63rd &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; wood14th & kedzie keeler & rooseveltkedvale & ogden fillmore & californiaogden & western polk & california16th & pulaski 16th & karloaccording to church spokesman vince clark, the rappers targeted by the include 50 cent and g-unit, nelly, ludacris, fat joe, lil wayne, twista snoop dogg and “all negative rappers.” i would  have thought a church in chicago would have at least over looked twista. if anyone can get a picture please let me know.
