nu hotel

new york, new york
the main idea for the nu hotel developed around the concept of visual and physical comfort. identifying the hotel room as a “wearable” … a cool t-shirt with your favorite pair of luxury jeans. utilizing a clean, non-trendy and honest palette: eco-friendly materials (cork, fsc certificated woods, vanilla and “utility gear” color tones) creates a “no-frilles” design approach rather than a superficial design statement. trendy and chic “is out”, smart, elegant, simple, cool, confident, casual… all that defines the nu hotels is “in”.
