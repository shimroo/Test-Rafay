imagine what could be accomplished if katrina victims had their own radio show. why can't they? because we've let corporations hoard the public airwaves to promote their agenda of hate.tags: hurricane katrina | katrina | new orleans | louisiana | america's wetland | bush is a moron | impeach bush | george w bush | bush | worst president ever | ray nagin | worst mayor ever | recall ray nagin | rebuild new orleans | we are not ok | katrina dissidents | failure is not an option | media democracy | entercom | wwl

	 when the road leads nowhere
    


when this is how the bush administration treats hard-working americans here at home, you really have to wonder what we're fighting for overseas?we really need the new congress to seriously address the problems people are confronting in new orleans -- in a comprehensive and directed way, not with palliatives to ease their consciences. and hurricane katrina issues need to be on the agenda of 2008 presidential candidates.tags: hurricane katrina | katrina | new orleans | louisiana | america's wetland | bush is a moron | impeach bush | george w bush | bush | worst president ever | ray nagin | worst mayor ever | recall ray nagin | rebuild new orleans | we are not ok | katrina dissidents | failure is not an option
