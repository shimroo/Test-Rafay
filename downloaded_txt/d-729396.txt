testimonials



harley delivered perfectly milled materials on time for a great price. can't ask for better service. 5 stars!!!- costa andreou - kastro carpentry




these guys are experts at what they do, i've dropped in a few times when passing by to grab some of the silky oak and redgum slabs for furniture making. harley took the time to run me through how to prepare and finish the slabs and gave me an unreal price on the materials. massive thanks guys ! highly recommended   - henry noakes




awesome friendly people, couldn’t be happier with the floor boards we have gotten from them!melissa scott
