tauntek: cost-effective products & design services for the electronics 
		hobbyist or professional


above photo shows the 
		new midi interface designed for the roland cr-78 compurhythm drum 
		machine
alert: ebay and reverb seller nesynth, who claims to, and used to, 
		send me a royalty from every sale of my firmware, has not sent me any 
		payments since october of 2022, despite my emails, which he claims were 
		re-directed as spam.   i was able to message him through ebay 
		in early march and he promised he would send a payment promptly.   
		no payment ever arrived.  i will remove this message if 
		the situation changes.
