coins from 



cents to dollars! 











we are active buyers and sellers of gold, silver, and silver dollars, as well as other key date coins. we operate as coin dealers, offering a wide range of coins from cents through dollars, including those that are difficult to find. if you have specific requirements for any us coin, please feel free to call on us. please note that we deal with us coins/currency and foreign coins/currency. bullion is a volatile investment and is recommended for experienced collectors only. 







 





 











buyers service travel rules
 



we are highly motivated buyers of all coin collections. as buyers, we will travel to your verified location, providing the volume warrants. we have to impose some limitations on travel offers. if we travel to your location, prepare the current market evaluation of your collection, and make our standard 80 – 90% of the value offer, you must decide either to accept the offer or pay our standard evaluation fee. we charge by the “time to evaluate and travel,” with a minimum fee of $200. certainly, no fee involved if we buy your collection. some only want a written appraisal or valuation, that is ok, but we charge for the service.we will gladly value three or four of your coins without charge over the phone or in person here. call us for a “quick quote.” if you want more coins valued, but do not want to sell, we charge an hourly fee for our service.markets change daily, so the valuation provided that day is good for that day only. 10% – 20% market swings are not uncommon. collections estimated value of under $2,000 can be sent to us at the above address. prompt offers and/or checks to you upon receipt. unsure about shipping? send your collection to us registered mail, insured for an amount you feel it is worth. provide an inventory sheet (keep one as well), with (if possible) grade and quantity of all items.
