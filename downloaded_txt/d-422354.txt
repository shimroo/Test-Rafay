welcome to lusitania online
the home port of rms lusitania on the web since 2000
no1 for information on the rms lusitania and her last master captain 
w.t.turner



there is not a briton anywhere who ought not to feel proud that this launch 
has placed great britain firmly at the forefront of marine architecture."
sir charles mclaren, chairman of john brown & co. at the launching of the lusitania.  


the lusitania story was updated and re-published in 2015, to commemorate the centenary 
of the sinking.  click here for details.
as many of you may already know, we sadly said a final "goodbye" to gregg bemis in 2020. 
gregg wrote the forewords to both versions of the lusitania story and was a staunch 
supporter of our work, both the books and this ongoing website. gregg used to say: "if you 
want to read the usual soap opera stories about the lusitania, there are plenty of books out 
there. if you want to know the truth about what actually happened, read the lusitania story."  
high praise indeed and to his dying day, ours was the only book on the 
subject gregg would ever endorse. 
gregg was a visionary and his vision had two aims. the first was to absolutely get to the truth
 of the lusitania disaster. the second was always to create a permanent lusitania museum, 
as a memorial to the ship and her people and to preserve and honour their unique place in 
history. accordingly, in 2019, he bequeathed his ownership of the wreck and artefacts he had
 collected for his planned museum, to the lusitania museum and signal tower project 
located on the old head of kinsale, southern ireland. the project has taken up gregg's torch
 to carry forward and we are extremely proud to offer our own support to the project, in 
honour of our late friend and supporter of twenty years standing; gregg bemis.
this worthy and ambitious project still needs help though. a lot has already been done and 
gregg's vision is taking shape, out on the headland overlooking the site of the 1915 tragedy. 
please, follow this link to the project's website. www.oldheadofkinsale.com  for all the details 
of this truly remarkable project and how you too, can help.

rnli lifeboat station at courtmacsherry's lusitania page
lusitania online are proud of our association with two of the rnli's lifeboat stations. 2024 marks the 200th anniversary of this 
truly remarkable institution and it is a fitting moment to reflect upon the vital round the clock service the rnli provides, saving 
countless lives at sea in all weathers. it must be remembered that the rnli receives no government funding. they are a charity and 
as such, they rely entirely on the generosity of the public. lifeboat crews do not get paid. they do what they do, time and again, 
very often risking their own lives, purely to help others in distress. the lifeboat service, all too often taken for granted, can only keep 
going if we, all of us, support it. the rnli is truly our service. help keep them afloat. you never know; one day, it may be you or yours 
who, in a desperate and life-threatening situation, will be only too relieved to see the bright blue and orange lifeboat crewed by 
bravely determined volunteers, speeding to the rescue!
visit the rnli website today. be an important part of the "one crew" that together, is 
the rnli. https://rnli.org/

we are pleased to announce our association with another historic ship society:
the medway queen preservation society. 
based at gillingham pier in medway, kent, the mqps is a registered charity dedicated to saving this former 
thames estuary pleasure steamer. she became known as "the heroine of dunkirk" after she rescued 7,000 troops 
during operation dynamo, the dunkirk evacuation of may/june 1940. 
the full details of her remarkable story can be found in the pages of richard halton's books and on the mqps website
