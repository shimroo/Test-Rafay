testimonials






used golden eagle for a company outing. we had such a great time! the water was calm, staff was friendly, and the fishing was good! 
tom



been on this boat a few times this year, some trips better than others but the effort is always there. one time they sailed with only 9 people and wound up going 30 miles off to the brooklyn/queens area but found the fish and it ended up being a memorable day. can't ask for more than that. crew is top notch and the captain friendly and outgoing, even coming down on deck to joke around with us. full galley is a plus too.

my boss recommended that i go on the golden eagle when i told him that i was taking some family and out of town friends fishing. we had the time of our lives and we learned things about the ocean, the new jersey coast, and of course - fishing! the mates scottie and antwan were extremely fast and efficient when things got hectic with several people reeling in fish at once. those guys are top notch and were i'm instrumental in shaping one of the most memorable and fun times that we have enjoyed as a family. thank you scottie, antwan, and captain!

i highly recommend a trip with the golden eagle and her top-notch crew. cheese scotty barry anrwan louis lip and captain pop pop rich thank you for a wonderful time. 
ant m



best fishing boat i have ever been on. the captain always puts the boat on the fish and is not afraid to move around or go the distance to do that. he puts out very honest fishing reports every day. the mates are hard working and very friendly. they don't even let you touch the fish. they take them off the line and ask where you want them to put it. i've been on many party boats where the captains take you on a very slow ride then just stop telling you the fish are there when they are not. then they take you on a very slow ride back to the dock. 
keith m

richard g



i've been on this boat a few times and it's always a good time. 
rob k



have fished with the golden eagle for a number of seasons and have always found the crew to be friendly and helpful! from time to time we have great days with our limit and once in a great while we get skunked, but it’s still a great day on the water! as they say, it’s called fishing not catching. the crew always does their best to find the fish and entice them to bite! good luck! 
dave b

nicholas s
