cancer                                            dreams come true has two "no more chemo" bells at the wolfson children's hospital. jaliyah recently rang one of them after months of radiation and chemotherapy. many other dreamers and local children have rung the bells to end their treatments and start their journeys to remission.

  without the support of our local community & businesses, none of this would be possible!
