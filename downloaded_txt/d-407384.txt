“it is good to praise the lord and make music to your name, o most high!” (psalm 92:1) 



it is good to worship the lord with singing, and that is what true vine music is all about.  true vine music produces original worship songs for congregational singing, theme songs for christian schools, as well as songs for special occasions, such as baptisms and weddings.
true vine music features the songs of michael a. schmid of st. john's lutheran church in napa, california. in addition to serving as a pastor and worship leader, he is also a talented musician and songwriter, who delights in creating songs that help people celebrate the love of god.
