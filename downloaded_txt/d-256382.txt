what is the difference between silent pianos, hybrid pianos, and mute pedal on upright pianos?



sep 13, 2021




over the years we have seen many customers interested in silent pianos, most often coming across one for the first time when visiting our stores. most acoustic upright pianos have a mute pedal as the middle of three pedals located at the bottom of the piano. regularly coined the “practice pedal” after its primary purpose, the mute pedal lowers a piece of felt between the hammers and strings inside the instrument, significantly lowering the volume when playing.the mechanism can be locked by sliding the pedal down and to the left so that the sustain and left pedal can be used freely.

how to tune my piano by myself



jun 9, 2021




if you have an acoustic piano it needs to be tuned twice a year or at least once a year. tuning is a procedure that turns and holds the pins that are connected to the strings. there is strong tension pulling the strings to create the correct pitch. most of the notes on the keyboard have several strings per key.

about grotrian 



apr 26, 2021




grotrian-steinweg pianos was founded in 1835 by henry steinweg (steinway in the us). prominent piano maker friedrich grotrian, became a partner of the company and his sons eventually purchased grotrian-steinweg in 1865. through trademark conflicts with steinway who had branched his manufacturing to the us, grotrian dropped steinweg from it’s name for us operations. pianists of the time, notably ignacy jan paderewski and clara schumann, preferred the premium build of grotrian-steinweg pianos.

5 things to look for when purchasing a used piano



feb 1, 2021




are you looking to add a piano to your home? we understand that pianos are an expensive instrument, more so if they are brand new. living in nyc, you’ll come across many giveaway / ridiculously low-priced pianos on craigslist, facebook marketplace, and classified ads. but how do you know they are worth the purchase or costs in moving the piano? firstly, we recommend hiring a piano technician to look over any used piano you are purchasing. pianos sold at stores go through a rebuilding/refurbishment process before being sold and come with a warranty for peace of mind. here are few tips when purchasing a used piano from a piano store or from a private seller.

oct 29, 2020




compared to 20 years ago, there are many ways to purchase a piano in the present day. in the old days, a customer could visit one or several different musical instrument stores, or receive a hand-me-down discounted piano from a teacher, friend, family, or neighbors. hand-me downs or purchasing from individual sellers may be an inexpensive option, but you may not get a good deal after all. read ahead to see why!
