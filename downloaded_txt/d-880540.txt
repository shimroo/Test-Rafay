beautiful place on the rushing turquoise molalla river. great place for church retreat, family reunion or getaway. management is awesome.
google user review
my church went to molalla retreat for our annual womenâ€™s retreat. we had 22 attendees but the site could have easily held more! the lodge was clean, comfortable, and it was easy to control the temperature. there were 4 showers, a big kitchen, and a spacious meeting area! we were in the main lodge but there a couple different lodges, one of them will be sure to fit your needs. the owners were very nice and easy to work with! i would return to this facility.
