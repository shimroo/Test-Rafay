santa monica's finest car & truck repair center
approved auto repair
we now offer mist in-car air quality terraclean

have you ever thought about the air you're breathing? in your vehicle. our engineers did. and decided to do something about it... mist
air quality is a commonly known issue in the workplace, home and outdoor environment but what about inside your vehicle. today, the automobile's ventilation system is a prime breeding ground for living microorganisms. mist is specifically engineered as the solution for treating allergens such as bacteria, mildew and mold in the ventilation system and the passenger cabin. unlike cabin air filters which are barriers designed to trap most air-borne particles, fumes and chemical pollutants coming from the outside, mist treats the living microorganisms inside your vehicle. next time you are in getting your vehicle serviced, ask for mist by name - it's a fast, inexpensive way to improve your vehicle's in car air quality.
mist is a great treatment for improving the air quality inside your car, van or truck. having trouble breathing inside your vehicle, feeling fatigue while driving, maybe it's the air you are breathing. drivers and passengers are spending much more time in their automobiles with the windows closed - turning on the air conditioning in the summer and heat in the winter.

factory-scheduled service & automotive repairs
your car or truck is a cherished investment and like most knowledgeable owners, you know performing routine, scheduled preventative maintenance will extend the life of your vehicle and reduce costly vehicle repairs. routine factory maintenance should be based on your manufacture's specifications.  if you do not know your car's factory service recommendations, please call.
as rule of thumb, we suggest an oil change every 3,000 to 5,000 miles or every 3 months. factory service should be performed at 15,000, 30,000, 60,000, 90,000 miles, and then every 30,000 miles. if your driving habits put substantial strain on the drive train, shorten the vehicle maintenance schedule to every 15,000 mile. do you drive fewer than 12,000 annually? consider scheduling preventive maintenance every 12 months as some vehicle parts are affected by age.
