we can help.














we help school communities accept and overcome the challenges technology creates in our homes and classrooms.    



















what’s the dilemma?

 

kids love tech.devices at home or in the classroom connect kids to their peers and families, offer humor and curiosity, and have the potential to show kids worlds beyond their own. on the flip side, unhealthy digital habits at home or in the classroom have been linked to obesity, sleep problems, mental health concerns such as loneliness and depression, and even lowered test scores.

 

teachers know tech is powerful.if teachers want engaged, curious, and excited students, technology seems to offer an avenue to all of those things (and more). however, classroom tech use is often adopted quickly and with little research, and the result can sometimes complicate lesson plans, replace more appropriate teaching tools, or impede learning or connection in the classroom. 

  

family life is filled with tech.modern families are fueled by the convenience and connectivity provided by digital technology, but they’re also challenged by screen time struggles, gaming concerns, and worries about age-inappropriate online content such as porn. throw in knowing when to let your child have a cell phone or enter the world of social media, and parents are often left unsure, stressed, and unsettled. 

   

administrators want innovation (and achievement).every administrator wants sophisticated and innovative teaching tools for their students and staff. however, when adopted too quickly or implemented without a clear, researched-based plan, technology is often used in non-additive, unsophisticated ways, only becoming a placeholder for innovation. without thoughtful and intentional policies surrounding device use in school, student well-being, safety, and achievement can be placed at risk.
















why do we focus on schools?

 











schools are hubs of influencewe believe schools are in a uniquely powerful position to make a lasting imprint for generations to come. teaching and modeling digital wellness practices can and should be a part of how schools help students thrive for a lifetime.













educators care about the worldteachers and admins don’t just care about test scores. they care about kids’ mental health, happiness, and well-being. as such, educators can and should embrace digital wellness.













 schools feel the impactschools are unique pain points for the challenges tech can pose; from social media bullying in the cafeteria to kids accessing porn on a school ipad, we believe schools need digital wellness resources now more than ever.
