2022 reel lifesaver fishing tournament
this video covers highlights from our 2022 reel lifesaver catch and release fishing tournament. it provides a great look into what a fishing adventure here at getaway lodge entails.

















located in port mansfield on the renowned lower laguna madre bay system of south texas, getaway lodge is the premier destination on the texas gulf coast for world class bay, nearshore and offshore fishing along with outstanding dove and waterfowl hunting.
the unique lower laguna madre estuary has given us one of the worlds finest inshore fisheries that is known for producing trophy class speckled trout as well as redfish, flounder and the occasional snook.  a short ride out the east cut puts you in the gulf of mexico for spectacular near shore fishing and second-to-none red snapper fishing in texas state waters for year-round action.
for the ultimate south texas experience, try our cast & blast that combines bay fishing with dove or waterfowl hunting in the same day. red hot dove hunting fields are just a short drive from the lodge and outstanding waterfowl hunting is accessed via shallow water bay boat or airboat.  guides scope out hunting locations daily to keep our guests on fresh birds throughout the season.





you don’t have to be an expert to come and enjoy yourself at getaway lodge.  from brand new to fishing and hunting to grizzled old outdoorsmen, we can accommodate everyone.  couples, friends, families or business groups.  men, women, kids of all ages. all are welcome!
our comfortable rooms include queen beds in most rooms and each room has a private bath.  for the ultimate in comfort and privacy, upgrade to our newly re-furnished governor’s suite with king bed, private living area and walk in shower.  outside the lodge, our sparkling pool is the most relaxing way to drain away a sun-soaked day of fishing while your guide cleans and prepares your catch for the trip home in your cooler.  if relaxing in the pool isn’t your thing, enjoy the south texas evening breeze on our shaded back deck or relax in front of our big screen television.









getaway lodge has always been known for great food. menu items like classic key lime pie, the best tres leches cake ever and our own south texas style getaway baked trout are guest favorites.  with notice, we can also accommodate special diets such as vegetarian, gluten or dairy free and others.  no one leaves getaway lodge hungry.  special meals for birthdays, anniversaries or any other occasion?  let us know, that’s what we do!
our complete package is just that, a complete package which includes rooms, all meals and fishing.  tackle is furnished if needed but experienced anglers are welcome to bring their own.  all you really need is your clothes, a fishing license and plenty of sunscreen for the south texas sun.  we take care of everything else.
