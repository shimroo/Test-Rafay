"bloodhounds"
      by "miss lazydays     of summer" is all about bloodhounds and  what you
      should know about them. this website contains lots of information on
      bloodhounds including our size, temperament, characteristics, and health
      issues. 

      bloodhounds are majestic, stout, and unique. bloodhounds are unlike any
      other breed of dog...sure bloodhounds have the same physical
      characteristics, such as paws, ears, tails, but what sets a bloodhound
      aside from the rest is other characteristics, such as: personality,
      scenting ability, stubbornness, medical problems...and much more that can
      be learned through this website. 
if you
      are considering the purchase of a bloodhound, please be sure to learn
      everything you can about the bloodhound before the big purchase is made! 
owning
      a bloodhound becomes a life-changing event. bloodhounds by no means are
      small lap dogs, although they may try! bloodhounds pups are adorable, but
      they grow up to be about 100 pounds on average. 

      bloodhounds are stubborn; bloodhounds can be obedient-trained, but for
      most it is a challenging task! bloodhounds drool; this could be the most
      undesirable characteristic of the breed. 
yet,
      bloodhounds love their moms and dads and family like no other breed is
      capable of. bloodhounds truly become part of the family, they blend right
      in. they want to do everything that you do, and be part of everything
      you're a part of, whether it's playing a game or eating dinner, a
      bloodhound will always be there, just like a child waiting for her
      turn...and how can you deny her?!
