black bank, black developer, black restaurant: ribbon cutting for the madison 801 (see videos & pics)updated:february 18, 2025by staff reporter

shareef’s latest expansion (baltimore – february 18, 2025) – today marked the grand opening of the madison 801, a new upscale sit-down restaurant in east baltimore, just steps from johns hopkins hospital. this latest venture further solidifies shareef’s brand as a greater baltimore metropolitan area staple. the restaurant’s success is a testament to the vision and dedication of shareef faulcon and his wife, sydney shaw, who deserve high praise for their entrepreneurial spirit. the madison 801 results from efforts led by the harbor bank of maryland, a historic black-owned institution founded by joseph haskins. decades after haskins went door to door promoting the bank, its legacy of community investment remains strong. germano gomez, managing director of the harbor bank of maryland’s community development corporation, played a key role in bringing the deal to life. with more than 20 years of experience in real estate development, financial modeling, and project management, gomez is deeply committed to fostering the next generation of minority developers. one such rising talent is chukes okoro, a nigerian-british-american developer whom gomez credits as an unsung hero behind the madison 801’s success. a legacy of culinary excellence shareef’s journey in the culinary world began in 2008, selling halal hotdogs, burgers, and italian ice on the corner of division & islamic way at masjid ul haqq. he opened his first brick-and-mortar restaurant at franklin and carey street two years later. in 2012, shareef expanded with shareef’s east at 628 n. chester street, followed by the launch of a food truck in 2013, serving customers throughout maryland. by 2015, shareef’s east relocated to 3320 belair road, continuing its mission to offer a healthier alternative to traditional carryout. the brand’s first expansion into baltimore county came in 2020 with the opening of the liberty road location. today, shareef’s fleet of food trucks serves customers across the tri-state area, maintaining a commitment to fresh, flavorful, and nutritious meals. a legacy of economic empowerment the harbor bank of maryland has been a force for economic empowerment in baltimore’s black community for decades. founded by joseph haskins, the bank’s grassroots efforts helped shape a legacy that continues today through a new generation of business leaders. among them is germano gomez, who champions opportunities for emerging minority developers. gomez had the honor of emceeing the grand opening of the madison 801, a milestone achievement for both shareef’s brand and baltimore’s economic landscape. with entrepreneurial success, community-driven investment, and a commitment to uplifting black businesses, the madison 801 stands as a symbol of growth and progress. see pics video: chukes okoro recognized at ribbon cutting of the madison 801  video: the madison 801: shareef & sydney shaw host ribbon cutting of sit-down restaurant in east baltimore
