belonging, dignity, and justice statement

our department is committed to creating knowledge, engaging in research and working to sustain the dignity of peoples the world over. oppressive systems, discriminatory policies, and violent practices undermine individual dignity; lead to widespread suffering, fear, and inequality; and affect the environment and more -than-human relations, which human life and all communities depend upon for their livelihoods. drawing on the longstanding work of geographers, we underscore the need to advocate for more just institutions and policies and an end to practices that infringe on the rights, freedoms, and lives of all peoples. our department is committed to creating a community where our students, faculty, staff and broader penn state community can engage in debate and conversation about our community and world. we seek approaches to teaching and research that affirm the dignity and worth of peoples from across the commonwealth, nation and world.
