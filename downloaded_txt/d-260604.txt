making waste things play thingswe are a reuse charity dedicated to helping businesses divert reusable waste away from landfill/energy recovery to help improve art and play opportunities for children, young people and adults.  with our store based in bristol we offer:



the scrapstore















 we have a large warehouse full of varied, colourful and abundant scrap materials fantastic for creative play opportunities at low costs. you can see examples of what scrap we’ve had recently here, or what scrap we’re currently looking for and what we don’t take here.  all of the scrap is safe surplus stock collected directly from local businesses and industry. if you would like to donate business waste please contact us. please bring your membership/supporters plus  card every time you visit as you won’t be able to access scrap without it. our opening times can be found above.



the artshop















 we offer a massive range and variety of arts and crafts materials, and the artshop is open to the public as well as our members. all of our products are competitively priced, with all profits going straight back into children’s scrapstore.  we also offer badge makers for hire. please contact us for more details.you can also shop for many of our products on our online shop, and you can come into store and collect or if you’re within our local area, we can deliver to your door. 



the playroom and events
