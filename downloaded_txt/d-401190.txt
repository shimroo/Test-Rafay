all is piano midiin the interest of answering the unasked question, "what if every sound was made from piano midis?", we present our own: 
singing piano's national anthem, the
talking piano's pledge of allegiance, 
real bird songs, and the video that got us here:




here's how you too can create a midi out of anything:


1) get audio file. (or you tube video)
2) head to ofoct's midi site to convert audio to a piano midi.
3) convert piano midi to a tab. 
4) enjoy your "song"?

thanks to stephen colbert for bringing this to our attention:
the catacombo sound system is "a revolutionary customized sound system for audiophiles on the other side.
the catacoffin employs a pair of two way speakers, tweeters, and a divine 8 inch subwoofer, fine tuned to the coffin's unique interior acoustic space.
so, embrace.  embrace your passion for music, in this life and the next."
colbert: "yes.  speakers mounted inside a coffin.  also the rejected sales pitch for the first mazda miata."  not to be outdone, colbert then announced his own solution for those who prefer cremation, the iurn - "when you're ready to rock your ash off".
