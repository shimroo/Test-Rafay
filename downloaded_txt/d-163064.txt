once again something is missing.art school is a ridiculous amount of money and it seems like the need for materials is never-ending. part of me just wants to drop out and go garden in canada. id like to get in touch with what created us, so not only could i learn more, but i could be more appreciative of our roots.what is all is this preparation for? shouldnt we all be here, right now?

real weird. paige and i were at borders and this lady came up to her and asked her if she could take pictures of her shoes. she said shes traveled a lot, and takes a lot of pictures of shoes and will soon write a book about it.then she took pictures of my shoes and she looked up and said, you seem like a very free spirit, and i love how you carry yourself. she then said, can i take pictures of you? and she put the camera in my face and just started shooting away. hahahhahow weird is that?
