(’how i wish’ ©2022 jon herington & madeleine peyroux) i am grateful for you and our collective journey through this mad world.— madeleine peyroux




how i wish i could bring tenderness, leavening, 
and to bare the fact of each heinous act  to which i’ve been a part
oh my black american heart
 
 

what i’d give and unlearn should some peace and concern 
fill this empty dread  along the wire we tread between fear and disgrace 
oh my red american face
 
 

would my life be in vain if in strife - or some small pain - 
i gave up my right to this greed and spite  then, what might begin? 
oh my white american skin 
 
 

endlessly journeying yet to hear freedom ring 
must we all be tossed on our nation’s cross for truth to be whole?  
oh my lost american soul  no more

my story“let us advance our mortal bodies upwhere hearts and minds will golet’s walk, let’s roll.”so sings madeleine peyroux on the upbeat title track of her captivating ninth album, let’s walk, the acclaimed singer-songwriter’s most assured, courageous work to date. powered by the distinctive, honeyed croon that delivered her from the paris streets to concert halls, these ten unabashedly personal songs, all co-written by the versatile peyroux, deftly interweave jazz, folk, and chamber pop, with themes ranging from the confessional to the political, from whimsy to yearning. in every note, peyroux digs deep, rendering this exquisite work with the disarming grace and gravitas of an artist in peak form.read moreon tourjoin email listfor special offers and info
