mission statement: queen of apostles is a christian community joined in one catholic faith and nourished by the same sacramental life. we celebrate the diversity of our people through our spiritual life, sharing of faith and knowledge, enjoyment of one another, the concern for human needs and the stewardship of all we have. we understand this challenge as disciples of jesus guided by his word and strengthened by his love.
