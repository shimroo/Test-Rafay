	 reports of my death,etc....
	 
    



yep, i'm still alive and kicking, which is more than i can say for my trusty t40. i've borrowed a computer for a few days to complete some non-blog projects, so the next couple'a few days should provide some posting opportunities. meanwhile, it's been a lotta days between charts of the day, so here, via think progress, is a sadly topical entry in that category...

	 consider this a placemarker...
	 
    


...for a proper remembrance of george mcgovern, who, weeks after returning from vietnam, i got my first campaign job with, and who i cast my first presidential ballot for.  a lot of who i am, personally and politically, comes from my early association with that great man.
