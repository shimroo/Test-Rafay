        latest release 
      






in his most ambitious project to date, lupe fiasco returns with samurai, a concept album that blends sharp lyricism, urban mythology, and philosophical reflection. inspired by the art of battle rapping and the stoic discipline of the samurai, the album explores the journey of a warrior navigating the music industry, personal struggles, and the fight for artistic integrity. each track is a carefully crafted narrative, filled with vivid imagery, cultural references, and introspective thought. samurai is more than an album—it’s a story of survival, mastery, and the relentless pursuit of excellence.
