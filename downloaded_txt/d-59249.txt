            in the best tradition of
the internet, we at
kellscraft studio are proud to bring to you hard to find, previously
printed books now in the public domain.  our focus is on public
domain books (anything published 1929 or earlier, in the u.s.), and we
concentrate on books known for their wonderful illustrations and
philosophy of life.  some books at our site will have no
illustrations, but are available here for their writing and importance.
 all books published here are in the public domain and out of
copyright, so are available to everyone to read, print and use in
classroom settings.

you have questions regarding
the web site, or any book listed here, feel free to contact me, jeff
