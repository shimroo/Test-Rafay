pelican arts studio
the pelican arts studio — primary working space for resident artist tom cardarella — is no longer one of the 39th street studios in the gateway arts center @ brentwood.  it is currently a virtual studio awaiting rebirth into a new physical space in the gateway arts district, or perhaps elsewhere.
to find more information about the gateway arts center and the gateway arts district go to these web sites:


39th street gallery (gateway cdc gallery & events)

brentwood arts exchange (part of the arts and cultural heritage division of the maryland-national capital park and planning commission)
prince georges african american museum and cultural center (gallery and offices)
gateway community development corporation (building owner and developer)

many of  tom's artworks can be seen here at pelican arts.  you can also see some of tom's drawings and paintings in the 
        artdc.org gallery, 
        and in the artomatic catalog.

pelican arts live 
the pelican arts live section was a calendar of events 
	  (mostly musical, mostly "acoustic") in the washington, d.c. area.  
	  due to lack of traffic here, and since there are other more useful and more 
	  thorough online calendars, this section was discontinued.
 here are a few other calendars you might find useful:
   wfma (world folk music association): http://www.wfma.net/dcevents.htm
   mary cliff/traditions: http://marycliff.net/whoswhere.php
   musi-cal concerts: http://www.musi-cal.com


and, of course, you can always use your favorite search engine to find 
	  the web sites of your favorite performers and venues.






quotes & excerpts
this section contains random quotes and written excerpts that appealed to 
      me for some reason.  they come from various sources – mostly books, 
      at least one verbal comment, perhaps some song lyrics.  many are 
      funny, some contain striking ideas, some are (perhaps) beautifully 
      written, all are meant to be interesting, to stimulate thought about 
      either form or content.
