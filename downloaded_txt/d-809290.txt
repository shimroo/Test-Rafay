news! 
hi all - i'm in the process of rebuilding this website. in the meantime, i'm teaching dobro workshop series on zoom for nashville acoustic camps, and past workshops are also for sale there under "previous zoom workshops"—have a look at  the nashville acoustic camps website.
i've also started a patreon where i'm regularly uploading short dobro lessons—tons of great learning material for a low subscription price.
you can find all of my music on bandcamp. 
email me if you'd like to get in touch. thanks!
