a gift from the past, a legacy for the future
an urban oasis with 50 acres of protected open space, the brooks estate in medford, massachusetts is a beloved environmental and historical treasure.

enjoy nature’s rich pageant year-round along the brooks pond habitat, where fish, migrating birds, and various forest creatures make their home.
follow the walking path up to the majestic shepherd brooks manor and carriage house, each an architectural masterpiece and the focus of ongoing restoration for continued community benefit.
