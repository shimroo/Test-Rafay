making memories that last a lifetime
we make it our mission to make campers feel comfortable and welcomed into a community that respects and supports one another. what makes camp a meaningful experience is when your child is able to confidently and fearlessly explore their limits and conquer challenges. our experienced leadership staff and trained counselors put all of their energy into building a culture of inclusiveness.

our legacy
being a part of the camp america family means more than just showing up to camp everyday. whether you are a camper or staff member, we always do what we can to make everyone feel like they are a part of something special. over 50+ years, generations of campers have grown to become staff members and join the ever growing family tree.
