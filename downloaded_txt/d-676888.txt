	 aluminum fishing boats
    


aluminum fishing boats - how to find the highest quality fishing boats without breaking the bankby marcus washingtonfinding aluminum fishing boats is becoming easier and easier, because so many people are buying them that there are more available to choose from. these are becoming more widely used than fiberglass and steel boats, and you’re about to find out why.number one, they are lighter than either of these more traditional boats, which makes them quicker and more nimbler out on the lake, river or ocean you are going on.they will not rust, which helps them keep their value a lot longer than the other boats mentioned. they usually have much less wear and tear overall on the body, which helps them keep their value much better than the other two boats listed.i wouldn’t recommend you go to a dealership when looking for aluminum fishing boats, just because you can almost always save a lot of money by purchasing them used, and they are still very high quality.many people will only allow themselves to buy new, simply because they believe that buying used is a crapshoot. while you can get a lemon when buying used, if you know what to look for, you really don’t’ have to worry about it.if you aren’t particularly knowledgeable about boat engines, which is the main thing you should be inspecting, i’d recommend you bring over a friend who is and have them take a look at it before buying. is this more difficult than just buying it new from the dealership? sure, but the amount of money you will save from taking this extra step is well worth the risk, in my book.you can find high quality aluminum fishing boats either in your local paper or on ebay, although many people have reservations about buying it online, since they can’t actually see the boat themselves, and this is admittedly more risky.when buying on the internet, you have to worry about either a dishonest person leaving out critical info about the boat, or someone who simply doesn’t know enough to catch a defect, and therefore you could wind up with a lemon. with that said, however, you can save a lot of money by purchasing online, so you need to decide for yourself if the added risk is worth the money you will no doubt save.another thing to consider is signing up for websites that have repossessed boats for sale, which can save you a tremendous amount of money when you know what to look for. with repossessed boats, the banks have essentially taken over a boat because somebody has defaulted payment on something, whether it be a loan, mortgage, etc.therefore, the banks have no use for the boat other than to get as much money as they can as fast as possible in order to pay off the amount needed, and they will be selling them at very cheap prices. i’d recommend you sign up for some of the sties that offers these as well, as you can save a pile when looking for aluminum fishing boats.about the author: want to learn more about aluminum fishing boats? check out http://www.internetfishingtips.com, a popular site that reviews fishing locations and equipment, and just about anything else related to fishing.source: www.isnare.compermanent link: http://www.isnare.com/?aid=306770&ca=advice

	 muskellunge
    


muskellungeby ronald moodymuskellunge, often simply referred to as muskies, are fast-becoming one of maine’s premier game fish. with a reputation for being a fierce, hard-running fish, muskellunge offer anglers of all abilities a challenge seldom matched by any other species. muskellunge are currently most prevalent in rivers in northern and western maine, but are becoming more widespread following their introduction into several new water systems.a typical muskellunge will grow to around 30-36 inches in length and weigh in anywhere between five and ten pounds. larger muskies are not uncommon however, with fish regularly exceeding fifteen pounds in some of maine’s more popular spots. their bodies are long and slender with dark vertical bars on a lighter green or brown background whilst their mouths contain a set of sharp teeth an indication of their aggressive, predatory nature. muskellunge look similar to northern pike, though can be distinguished by their typically lighter appearance and presence of seven or more (as opposed to the northern pike’s five) sensory pores under the jaw.muskellunge tend to spend much of their time in deeper waters before turning to the shallower, weedy areas in search of food. it is also strongly believed that the best time to land muskies, particularly trophy-sized, is either early in the morning or last thing in the evening prior to sunset. muskellunge can be caught throughout the day, though the biggest fish tend to steer clear of the shallower areas throughout much of the day.due to the fast-running, aggressive nature of the muskellunge, a strong rod and line are essential for a successful catch. many anglers prefer to go for a lightweight graphite or fibreglass rod coupled with 20-40 pound line. even a relatively small muskie will put up a fight, which is why such a strong line is required. crank or spinner baits are particularly effective for catching muskellunge, and both can be used with either a trolling or casting method. the colour of the lure is also important, and best results will be achieved by matching it with that of a local food source.muskellunge attract anglers from around the world to maine’s rivers, and particularly good spots for the species include baker lake and the st john watershed. the former is a world renowned spot, and it is strongly believed that there are few locations in the world that offer a better muskellunge fishing experience. whether you are looking for a trophy fish or simply relish the challenge of a big, powerful fighting fish, muskellunge are ideal.about the author: ronald moody has been an avid fisherman for 40 years. he enjoys all types of fishing, but especially likes salt-water fishing; he has been all over the country practicing his hobby. he is the owner and operator of http://www.fishingzoo.com, a website dedicated to inform fisherman about maine fishingsource: www.isnare.compermanent link: http://www.isnare.com/?aid=116411&ca=recreation

	 how to rig suckers fishing for muskies
    


by john betteonce the weather starts to change and water temps begin to drop, it is time to start thinking about fall fishing and live sucker baits. live bait/sucker fishing can be one of the most effective methods for catching muskies during the fall season. it can make the difference between having a great day on the water or a bad day. i have experienced many days in the fall where we had no action or follows from artificial lures, yet wound up with multiple fish days when we had suckers out.the first step in getting started with live bait/sucker fishing is to have the right set up. for sucker fishing i prefer an 8-foot heavy fiberglass rod - one that has a lot of backbone for strong hook sets. one of the reasons we like to use glass rods is because in extreme temperatures a graphite rod can shatter and risk injuring anyone around. also helpful is a good line counter reel for running the bait at accurate depths. i really like the okuma convector reels for this. as far as line goes, a good 80-100 pound test super braid like hi seas grand slam braid. the super braids are good so you don’t have the stretch factor when setting thehulcano harness by stealth tacklehooks. the next key ingredient is a good quick strike rig. i highly recommend using only quick strike rigs over the old single hook method because studies have proven that even though fish caught on a single hook have been successfully released, there is a delayed mortality factor involved. the last thing we want to see happen with a released trophy fish is that it ends up dying on the bottom of a lake somewhere. there are a lot of quick strike rigs available on the market, and which one to use depends on personal preferences for rigging. we have created our own quick strike rig called the hulcano harness by stealth tackle, which was designed by myself and musky guide mike hulbert. we have a very high success rate with our harness. this rig was developed with not only fish safety in mind but the fisherman as well. we use a one treble hook rig with a small lip hook so that it is simple to rig. it is ready to go within seconds - not minutes - without having to tie anything or use a rubber band and rigging needle. this rig is made with only one treble hook because in most cases only one hook gets into a fish on a hook set. any extra hooks are left swinging free and sometimes hook into the fish’s gills, or worse yet, in your hand while trying to unhook the fish. the herbie rigs, and maina rigs are also very effective and easy to use as well and offer a little different presentation and rigging. take a look at what is out there and pick the one that best suits your needs.rigged suckeronce we have our setup, we are ready to hit the water! i like to run my suckers a couple different ways depending on the area of the lake i am fishing. i usually like to weigh the sucker down by clipping a bell sinker to the swivel at the top of the rig, so that i can run them straight down above the tops of the weeds. you can also use a heavy rubber core sinker attached to your line just above the rig. the okuma line counter reels come in handy for setting the correct depth. i am able to make the adjustments i need by checking the depth on my depth finder and seeing where the top of the weeds are so that i can set my bait accordingly. this also helps me if i am fishing open water where there are suspended fish. i can set my bait right at or above schools of bait or large fish that i marked on the screen of my depth finder. by using the line counters and knowing the depth you set your bait at, makes it easy to repeat the same exact presentation if you boat a fish at a certain depth. if possible i like to run multiple suckers. i will run one sucker straight down off the side of the boat and another under a large slip bobber a few feet off the back of the boat. i do not like to run them too far behind the boat because if a fish hits too far out it can be hard to get a good hook set in them. i prefer to be directly over the top of the fish when i am setting the hooks. also, if the line is too far out from the boat, by the time you catch up to the fish and pick up the slack line, you risk giving the fish time to swallow the rig which could wind up killing it. while running the suckers close to the boat, there have been many times where we bring a fish up on a follow and it will break off and hit the live bait verses following and tuning back out to where it came from. it is a great method for converting followers into eaters.the key with using quick strike rigs is making sure you don’t waste too much time from when the fish hits, until setting the hook. thus the name "quick strike rig". you usually never need more than a minute to 90 seconds get this done. another great feature on the okuma line counter reels is a loud bait clicker or alarm. if you have the bait clickers set when a fish hits, it will alert you immediately. i usually set my rods in the rod holders, with the bails closed and the drag as loose as it will go. another option is to leave your bail open and have the reel in freespool mode. however, i don’t like doing this in case the reel accidentally gets closed. with the drag tight, the fish the fish will feel the tension when it hits and may let go of the bait causing you to lose your catch. by having the spool closed and the drag loose, you are leaving less room for error. i always double check my drag before setting the hooks anyway so for me this is the easiest way. once the clicker goes off, the fish has taken the bait. i grab the rod from the rod holder, and work as quickly and calmly as i can to position the boat above or directly over the fish so that my line is straight down to the fish (reeling the line slowly in as we reposition over the fish). in the meantime my partner is usually clearing the other line or lines, moving things in the boat, and preparing the net. once over the top of the fish i reel up all the slack line and put a little tension on it. there should be enough tension to feel the fish and feel when the fish is actually flipping the bait in its mouth. this is usually felt by a few small taps. once this occurs, usually within a minute or so, it is time to set the hook. re-tighten your drag so that it is locked down tight – you don’t want any line slippage. reel down to the water and give it all you got! i don’t think you can set a hook hard enough. keep in mind that in most cases you are using a 12-14 inch live sucker and in some cases even bigger. the fish has a firm grip on the bait and you need to be sure you can bury the hooks into the upper jaw of the fish’s mouth. when setting the hook, there are two things you want to happen. first, you want the bait to break free from the fish’s mouth. second, you want good hook penetration into the hard upper jawbone of the fish. i cannot stress enough how important it is to set the hook as hard as you can and let the fight begin! a good rod will support your efforts, and you should not have to worry about breaking the rod. hopefully, all of this will result in great big fish in the net. having the proper tools out and ready (don’t forget the camera) will result in a great picture and a quick release!as always, check your local rules and regulations before you begin live bait fishing. there are many different rules for different areas. what works in some areas may very well be illegal in other areas. there are laws regarding the number of lines you can run as well as boat movement while dragging live bait. these are two things to pay very close attention to when you are setting out to fish. also, be sure to check the live bait regulations as far as transporting live bait. hopefully, these words of wisdom will help you become a better and more effective sucker fisherman! as always please practice 100% catch and release, the future of our fisheries depends on it!http://www.fishinfo.com/fishing-articles/article_550.shtml--------------------------------------------------------------------------------john bette stealth tacklejohn bette is the owner of stealth fishing tackle & fishing leaders providing the highest quality fishing leaders and sucker quick strike rigs on the market today. for more information please visit stealth tackle

	 fishing tackle - how to know what the best fishing tackle for your location
    


fishing tackle - how to know what the best fishing tackle for your location isby jimmy harriswhen it comes to being an effective fisherman, few components matter as much as your fishing tackle selection. you could be the best fisherman in the world, but without the right tackle for the fish you are fishing, you aren’t going to catch many fish-period.on the other hand, you could be the worst fisherman in the world, but if you have the correct tackle for your area, you still have a shot at catching your fish.as with fishing knots, fishing tackle is one of the fundamentals you need to master. so many people are so focused on technique that they completely forget about the fundamentals such as having correct fishing knots and tackle; this is just like trying to master the golf swing without knowing the right grip and setup. it just won’t work.the number one thing you need to understand is that the lures are the most crucial aspect of your tackle, and the one you should pay the most attention to. this is what’s going to make or break your success.what’s the best kind of lure to get? as with anything in fishing, it depends on what kind of fish you are going after, and where you plan on fishing.you need to know this information before you get fishing tackle. consider not only the variety of fish you are targeting, but what they will be eating in the area you will be. try to get lures that mimic what they eat as much has possible, as this is much more likely to attract them.if you don’t know what the fish in the area you will be fishing will be eating, call up the local fishing guides in the area, and ask what kind of lures they’d recommend. a pretty foolproof method, and one that’s virtually guaranteed to give you the correct fishing lures for your trip.if you plan on fishing in the same area many times, then the best method to learn the right tackle to use is to go fishing with an experienced fisherman for your first several trips, and see what equipment they use.there’s nothing like copying people who already have the skill you want to learn, as this is much quicker than attempting to learn it al yourself, which can take years of trial and error. so many people do this when they could cut a huge chunk of time out of their learning curve by simply modeling other top fisherman.now that we’ve gotten the most important aspect of your tackle out of the way, there are still some important things you need to consider, such as gear. always purchase clothing appropriate to wear you will be fishing, and the season as well.where should you get your fishing tackle? obviously, you can do so at your local fishing shops, but here is a much better method-buy them online.you can generally save a lot of money using this method, as the selection will be wider and if you search enough, you will probably save about 50% or more off the typical retail price for comparable offline fishing tackle.about the author: want to learn more about finding the best fishing tackle? check out http://www.internetfishingtips.com, a popular site that reviews fishing boats and how to avoid getting ripped off when buying one. also learn about  alaska crab fishing jobs, and just about anything else pertaining to fishing.source: www.isnare.compermanent link: http://www.isnare.com/?aid=296224&ca=recreation

choosing the best muskie lures depends on several factors. first, you need to consider the rod and reel that you are using. next up is the weather conditions. of course, the lake and the vegetation are also important. and don't forget the natural bait fish in the lake. many things to consider when selecting the best musky lures.

	 learn the facts that can help you catch the trophies
    


muskie - learn the facts that can help you catch the trophiesby robert benjaminmuskie is the nick name giving to muskellunge (esox masquinongy) which name comes from the ojibwe word "maashkinoozhe" (ugly pike), although some citations refers the name is from the french "masque allongé" (long mask) a modified ojibwe etymology. muskie is a relatively rare, large and elusive freshwater fish of north america, more often found in minnesota. this fish is the largest member of the pike family, esocidae, with 3 recognized subspecies: chautauqua muskellunge (esox masquinongy ohiensis) - tiger muskellunge (esox masquinongy immaculatus) - great lakes muskellunge (esox masquinongy masquinongy)all the subspecies are present in the areas where muskie live, including the great lakes (region north to canada), chautauqua lake, lake ontario, the ohio river system, the saint lawrence river, hudson bay, and in the upper mississippi, generally preferring cold, clear lakes and large rivers.subspecies have also name variations, such as wisconsin muskellunge, barred muskellunge, allegheny river pike, jack, pike, ohio muskellunge, barred muskellunge, ohio river pike, and unspotted muskellunge, all of them lurking among weeds and floating plants, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.shared preferences make northern pike, muskellunge and even the american eel occur in the same body of water, generally leading to incidents of interbreeding. muskellunge eat fish, small muskrats and sometimes ducklings, thanks to their tooth-lined jaws. muskellunges are usually light colored with long bodies and dark bars running up and down, opposite of their close competitor, the northern pike, which can be identified by the light marks over their dark body. body's colors vary from light green, silver and light brown.northern pike have 5 or fewer sensory pores on the underside of their jaw, while muskellunges have six or more. there are also a sterile hybrid of the tiger muskie and the northern pike stocked in several lakes in the twin cities metro region, easily identifiable because of their dark markings over a light background (similar to a muskie), but with rounded tail fins, like on northern pikes.muskies resemble northern pike in behavior and appearance, with flat heads, elongated bodies, as well as dorsal, pelvic and anal fins set far back of the head. they grow as big as 2 to 6 feet (71 to 183 cm) and weigh around 66 pounds (30 kilograms).depending on their habitat, sometimes the marking of muskellunges break up into spots, or is totally absent in turbid waters. in addition, the lobes of the tail fin in muskellunge usually come to a sharper point than those observed of the northern pike.  there is a website that has great information on most species of freshwater fish. it has details that pertain to each species of fish such as habitat, spawning, eating habits, the best lures and baits and more, the website is called: fishing stringer, and can be found at this url:http://www.fishingstringer.comby robert w. benjaminyou may publish this article in your ezine, newsletter, or on your web site as long as it is reprinted in its entirety and without modification except for formatting needs or grammar corrections.about the author: robert w. benjamin has been in the software business on the internet for over 5 years, and has been producing low-cost software for the past 25+ years. he first released products on the amiga and c64 computer systems in the late 1970's-80's.get a credit card or fastcash loan today!http://www.rb59.comsource: www.isnare.compermanent link: http://www.isnare.com/?aid=192732&ca=recreation

	 fishing rods for your type of fishing
    


fishing rods for your type of fishingby robert feuringwhen you’re looking for to purchase fishing rods, you should know that it’s not a one-size-fits-all market. you wouldn’t buy a ferrari if you just wanted to drive the kids to school and go to the grocery store just like you wouldn’t buy a dodge caravan for street racing. you have to know your purpose before purchasing the right fishing equipment for the tasks ahead.let’s look at some of the different types of fishing you might want to consider and how that might influence the purchase of your fishing rods.fishing rods for inshore fishingif you’re doing some inshore fishing, you need to realize what that means: working in shallow water and trying to catch fairly small fish. what you are going to look for in the fishing rods is one that will be heavy enough to pull in decent size fish but you want to choose one that is lightweight enough that you can cast it easily without causing your body to ache the next day.you’ll probably want to look for either casting or spinning rods. these would also be good choices if you’re going to be doing bottom fishing, such as for catfish and other fish that stay close to the bottom of watery areas.don’t confuse these fishing rods with what you would need for inshore fly fishing. for that, you’ll still need to purchase fly fishing equipment.fishing rods for offshore fishingwhen you’re going to be doing offshore fishing, you’re going to want a rod that can handle whatever you throw at it. no matter what type of offshore fishing you’re doing you can expect to spend more the fishing rods you’ll need than you would for ordinary fishing equipment. for example, if you’re going to go trolling then you can expect to pay around $1,000. you may be able to find some cheaper options but you’ll want to shop around and pay attention to the quality of the item before you buy.bottom fishing is another example. while you can use the same equipment as you would for inshore fishing, you’d probably want something a little more substantial, especially if you are going to be hunting for big fish. these fishing rods are usually also heavier and less flexible than the ones used for trolling.fishing rods for surf and pier fishingif you’re going to be doing fishing in the surf or off of a pier, you’ll probably want to look into some fairly specialized equipment. surf rods are usually designed to help you cast further so that you can actually reach the fish. these rods can also be used for pier fishing as can most types of inshore fishing. however, you’ll want to still focus on choosing equipment that feels comfortable for you.looking for specific fishing rodsone of the bigger challenges you’re likely to face is finding these fishing rods at your local store. instead you should choose an online site like sea isle tackle which has a larger selection to choose from.about the author: fishing rods sea isle tackle has been proudly serving the saltwater fishing community for over 45 years. since opening day in 1962, we have dedicated ourself to providing the finest fishing tackle and shimano reels the industry has to offer. sea isle tackle has a great selection of fishing rods accessories.source: www.isnare.compermanent link: http://www.isnare.com/?aid=277094&ca=recreation

	 usa. nature vision moves into lure market
    


the move into the lure market is a first for the central minnesota firm, which remains best known for its aqua-vu underwater viewing systems. far from strangers to the world of fishing tackle, nature vision president and ceo jeff zernov represented lindy-little joe tackle for many years, prior to co-founding in-fisherman magazine in 1975.crazy crank lures are built using a super durable solid core resin that unlike wood or plastic, will not crack, leak, or sink. in addition, the lures cast like rockets and deliver a rhythmic yet consistent action, as well as a unique sound that's accomplished by through a hydro-dynamically designed head.a mere five prototypes of the rumbler topwater lure have accounted for over 60 muskies, including many by muskie fishing legends doug johnson and dick pearson."i am excited to place the rumbler and crazy crank in the hands of a respectable organization with the capabilities to get the lures in the boats of many more anglers." says crazy crank creator don schwartz. "the rumbler has piqued the interest of muskie anglers so fast that i just couldn't meet the demand on my own. this is a design and material that will change muskie fishing, and i think this move assures that the lures will get to the public before the imitations come along."

	 fig rig rods…one man’s experience
    


by craig sandell © 2007in 2005, i wrote this article documenting the problems that i experienced with the fig rig rod that i used. in 2006, message boards have had entries from folks who have experienced similar problems. according to some of the chat, fig rig had a bad run of blanks that caused the problem...something that fig rig contends has been resolved.  i would submit that it is not enough for a manufacturer to say that it has fixed the problem; confidence in a product can only be restored if, along with the cause, the manufacturer defines what 'corrective action' has been instituted to purge defective items in stock and ensure that safe guards have been put in place to prevent the problem from happening again. in addition, i have gotten first hand reports from fig rig users that they have had to re-attach their rod tip guide because it came loose during normal use...this would appear to indicate that fig rig has a larger problem than faulty blanks from their supplier. you will have to make up your own mind as to whether you want to trust your time on the water to a rod that has demonstrated a propensity to fail under the stress of musky angling.2007 updateon 3/26/07 musky america received a request via an email from a person representing himself as kevin figgins requesting that we remove this article. mr. figgins was informed that the article was a factual account of problems encountered using the fig rig rod. musky america offered mr. figgins the opportunity to submit a rebuttal to this article...to date we have received no additional input from mr. figgins.we have received another failure report from a person who indicated that he went through 4 of the 8 foot fig rig rods during the 2006 season. he indicated that when he contacted fig rig, he got the standard answer that they had a run of bad blanks and that the problem has been fixed...the person reporting the problem indicated that he went to using rods from different manufacturers.in september of 2005, i participated in the lake chippewa flowage muskie tournament. the whole experience was a great one and the event was very well administered.i was fortunate to have won a fig rig 7’ medium rod as a door prize. since all of my custom made rods are 6½’, i was anxious to see how this 7’ rod would perform for me on the water.as soon as i got back to my trailer at indian trail resort, i set up the rod with an abu garcia 5500 loaded with tuf line. i planned to use the rod as a bucktail rod when i went to phillips, wi to fish with my good friend rob meusec.the next day, i was on the water casting a 1½ ounce bucktail toward the deep edge of a weed line. as i was retrieving the bucktail, a fish hit about 20 feet from the boat. i set the hook and much to my chagrin, the fig rig rod that i had won and had high hope for, broke in the thick portion of the rod shaft. well, i lost the fish as well as the use of the rod…i was not a happy camper.when i got back to indian trail resort, i was in the bar relating the sad story when another person at the bar piped up and said that he had a couple of friends who had also had their fig rig rods break on them.i thought that this was something that the folks at fig rig should know about. i packed up the remnants of the rod and sent it to fig rig at my own expense, along with a note explaining the circumstance surrounding the failure of the fig rig rod…i did not ask them to replace the rod but i did encourage them to reassess their quality control and application engineering.in early october, i received a new rod in the mail, along with an invoice of $25.00 for the shipping charges. they did not credit the $6.50 that it cost me to send the broken fig rig rod to them and provided no note expressing a concern that their fig rig rod had failed during the most elementary aspect of the muskie experience…the setting of the hook.i am sure that there are folks out there who have used these rods without having them break into pieces. would i use this rod again?…in a word "no". like all of you, i spend a lot of time on and off the water working hard to locate and catch our muskie friend. i am not about to take a chance that this same circumstance will happen again.as a final observation, the fig rig rod had a muskies, inc. decal on it providing the perception that the rod is in some way endorsed by muskies, inc. if that is the case, i would encourage muskies, inc. to reassess its endorsement of the fig rig rod. if it is not the case, i would encourage muskies, inc. to petition fig rig to remove the muskies, inc. decal from their rod until such time that fig rig provides "cause and corrective action" regarding the failure of their medium 7’ muskie rod.

	 green bay about more than packers these days
    


by doug newhoff, sports editorreen bay, wis. â€” residents of green bay probably arenâ€™t ready to start skipping packer games for a day of fishing on the bay.but there might be a few diehard fans at least considering it as an option.these days, the waters of green bay are making an equally indelible impression on anglers who enjoy the pursuit of walleyes, smallmouth bass, perch and even muskies. a body of water that was once as polluted as ricky williams' bloodstream is living the clean life and teeming with fish - especially walleyes."it's at an all-time best right now for both numbers and the size of the fish," said don kohl, who has lived in the area for the past 23 years. "it's just silly right now."the masters walleye circuit exposed the bay's big walleye potential in 1998 when it first visited the area.with the fish in a late-summer pattern of prowling the rocky reefs in the northern half of the bay, 196 mwc teams lugged 1,009 walleyes to the scales weighing an average of 4 1/2 pounds apiece. it took a two-day, 10-walleye limit of 68.40 pounds to win and 42.76 pounds to finish among the top 35 teams.three weeks ago, the mwc returned to green bay for the first time in several years. participants discovered they didn't need to make a risky, 50-mile run to the northern reefs. these days, there are more than enough walleyes in the southern part of the bay to keep a boatload of anglers busy.during the two-day mwc event, 184 teams weighed in 1,555 walleyes averaging 3.75 pounds apiece. dozens of walleyes weighing between 8 and 11 pounds were caught. it took 56 1/2 pounds to win and a two-day catch of 40 pounds to make the top 50."it's funny because not that long ago, maybe 10 to 12 years ago, the south part of the bay was unexplored," said kohl, a veteran tournament angler who is taking a year off from competitive fishing. "i think because of the combination of the population growing and fishermen getting better, the south half of the bay right now is every bit as good for big fish numbers as the northern half."our biologists tell us we've had a number of good year classes. four of the last five years have been just perfect conditions. and the food base in the bay is incredible."some of it might have to do with the zebra mussels, too. nobody wanted to see them in the bay, but say what you want, i think they have helped with the water quality. there has also been a lot of cleanup from the (paper) mills along the fox river, and when you clean up the river, you clean up the bay."during the mwc event, many teams of anglers reported catches of 40 to 50 fish a day while slow-trolling in-line spinner rigs tipped with nightcrawlers and using planer boards to carry their lines away from the boat. while those catches included drum, catfish, perch, smallmouth and the occasional muskie, most of the fish were walleyes. most of the walleyes measured 18 to 22 inches in length, but almost every catch included a fish or two in the 28- to 30-inch class."it just blows my mind," said kohl. "for the last 10 years in the bay, it's been commonplace for guys to go out and catch numbers of quality fish."perch fishing is nearly as popular as walleye fishing on the bay. dozens of small boats can be found anchored up on almost every southern reef."it's back now, finally," said kohl, noting that commercial fishing, angler harvest and predation from cormorants contributed to the decline."they've reduced angler limits and commercial harvest limits the last few years, and they're trying to control the cormorants. the perch population is showing the results. we have great numbers of 9- to 11-inch perch again with plenty of bigger ones out there."the smallmouth fishery is one of the best anywhere, especially on the reefs and rocky shorelines in the northern part of the bay near sturgeon bay, wis. like the walleyes, they grow fat and sassy with fish up to 4 pounds common.and along with the improvements in water quality and the vast forage base available, the muskie population is thriving."this has become a world class muskie fishery," said kohl. "the last few years, it's incredible how many guys have started coming to the bay to fish muskies."there are numbers and size. there are a lot of 50-plus inch fish being caught, especially in the spring and fall, and it will only get better."of course, green bay faces threats to its fishery. invasive species like zebra mussels and gobies are a concern, as are new fish viruses that are spreading throughout the great lakes.however, there aren't many places that currently provide any better fishing."overall, with the numbers of fish to be caught, it's an outstanding place to bring somebody just to catch fish," said kohl. "it's not like you're going to go for hours out there and not get a bite. you will be busy reeling in something all the time."you can fish about any way you want and be successful. you can slip-bobber, jig, throw crankbaits, troll spinners, troll crankbaits, drift-fish ..."and you don't need a big boat. if the wind kicks up, there are still plenty of places that are protected in the southern bay, plus the river, which kind of gets overlooked now because the bay is so good."we're pretty blessed."contact doug newhoff at (319) 291-1467 or doug.newhoff@wcfcourier.com

	 record muskie
    


video linka mandan man reels in a record muskie.cory bosch of mandan was fishing all by himself on new johns lake north of bismarck on july third and caught a 46-pound-8-ounce muskie that measured 54 inches in length. bosch says it was quite a fight to get the fish into his boat.(cory bosch, mandan fisherman) "...back and forth and up and down. it would dive to the bottom and i'd slowly bring it up and it'd take five minutes every time i'd bring it back up. i'd try to land it and it would go back down. i didn't have a net. i had a small walleye net but i didn't want to risk getting the hooks caught in the net. so i had to hand land it and every time i'd try to grab it under the gills, it would flop its head and go right back down to the bottom...over and over you know."state game and fish officials had to take a sample of the fish to find out if it is a pure muskie or a cross between a muskie and a northern pike.but either way, officials say the fish is a state record holder.(scott gangl, fisheries management section leader) "we've stocked both pure muskies and tiger muskies, which is a hybrid between a muskie and a northern pike, into new johns lake. so we need to determine whether its one or the other. so the only way to do that definitively is by doing dna testing and so we're taking a sample of dna and we're sending it to a geneticist in maine who did the last onethe last time we had a record."if bosch's fish is a pure muskiehe beat the old record by 8 ounces. bill wald of washburn caught the last record holder also at new johns lake in 2003
