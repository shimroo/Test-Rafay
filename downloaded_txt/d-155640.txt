press reviews



"rogers is both a sensational and a sensitive blues guitarist - certainly among the finest slide guitarists playing today. his wailing slide guitar sound (and churning rhythms, when needed) mark him and his work as of the highest caliber."- san francisco chronicle



"rogers is an exceptionally articulate slide guitarist, whether he's scorching robert johnson's 'ramblin' blues' or taking a lovely, lyrical journey... or rockin' it out. one of the rare guitar heroes who values feeling over flash."- rolling stone
