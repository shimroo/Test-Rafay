about built green

built green is the green home certification program of the master builders association of king and snohomish counties. in addition to certifying green homes, remodels, apartments, and communities, we host a membership network of companies and individuals involved in the green building industry. we also research and communicate the human and environmental benefits of ecologically focused building.















sustainability
the conservation of resources leads to financial benefits and a higher quality of life, and helps ensure access to those resources by future generations. built green’s actions are guided by the aim of protecting and enhancing the ecological richness of our communities.

















market focus
built green believes the market can act as a powerful force to improve environmental and health outcomes. as such, we encourage voluntary green building incentives that will help shift the market, making green building truly profitable for all rather than simply forced.



















inclusion
often, those most impacted by environmental issues are those who have historically been marginalized. built green strives to cultivate relationships and strategic partnerships with diverse stakeholders in our community to better enhance the sustainability of our region for all of its inhabitants.

















excellence by example
demonstrating excellence inspires others to follow suit. built green seeks to serve as an example of continuous improvement, innovation and effectiveness to its members and the community at large.
