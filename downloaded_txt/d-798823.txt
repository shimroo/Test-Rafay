	 muslims help build hindu temple in bihar, india
	 
    


sitamarhi, bihar – as media continues to focus on claimed tensions between both faiths, indian muslims in the northern bihar's sitamarhi district have been quietly helping hindus in constructing a new temple to finish it before their coming chhath festival in november.

"muslims are not only donating money for temple construction, they are also actively involved in ensuring that it should come up soon," rajkishore raut, president of the shiva temple construction committee, told ians.

raut, a school teacher, said the construction of the temple was a fine example of hindu-muslim brotherhood.

	 imam leads campaign against forced marriages
	 
    


a muslim scholar has launched a groundbreaking campaign against forced marriage in scotland.

shaykh amer jamil says the practice has no place in islam.

during the next few weeks leaflets and sermons are being given in mosques as part of an initiative to educate the community.

"in the muslim community there's a misconception amongst some people that religion allows this, that parents have an islamic right to choose partner of their children, and that they don't have a choice in this," says the glasgow-based imam.

[...]

"the only thing that can break a cultural norm for muslims is the religion," he explains.

"so when you come down and say in islam the prophet was against this practice, nobody can argue with you," he says.
