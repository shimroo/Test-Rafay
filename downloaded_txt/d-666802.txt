    “engagement gap” lessons
  















the engagement gap in the jewelry industry, which has been observed during the covid-19 pandemic, tells us that there have been significant changes in the demand for high-end jewelry, particularly engagement rings. with the pandemic causing the closure or reduced capacity of brick-and-mortar stores, consumers have shifted towards online channels, which has led to an increase in overall online sales. however, the online sales of high-end jewelry have not kept pace with lower-priced items.furthermore, the postponement of weddings due to the pandemic has led to a decrease in demand for engagement rings and other wedding-related jewelry, resulting in the "engagement gap." this trend highlights the importance of special occasions such as weddings in driving demand for high-end jewelry.the engagement gap also suggests that consumers are becoming more selective in their purchasing decisions and are more price-sensitive, possibly due to the economic impact of the pandemic. this could mean that jewelry companies may need to adjust their pricing and marketing strategies to appeal to changing consumer behavior.overall, the engagement gap indicates that the engagement ring industry, and the jewelry industry as a whole, must be flexible and adaptable to changing consumer preferences and buying habits. companies that can successfully navigate these changes are more likely to thrive in the long term.

a bountiful array of beautiful blossoms creates an atmosphere of romance! on your wonderful wedding day, pretty posies tell the world how you feel about each other!












a bountiful array of beautiful blossoms creates an atmosphere of romance! on your wonderful wedding day, pretty posies tell the world how you feel about each other!flowers speak a language all their own - we use them to say so many things: "i love you," "im sorry. or "get better soon. every flower holds meaning all its own - take the time to choose the kinds and colors that express your personal sentiments.flowers play a major role at your wedding; arrangements may be as simple or elaborate as you desire. a professional florist's advice is invaluable - working together, you can achieve the perfect ambiance for your wedding.choose your florist three to six months before the big day. he may wish to visit the wedding and reception sites to view the layout. provide photos and fabric swatches if possible from your wedding gown and attendants' dresses. details on the groom's and mothers' attire are helpful in planning your wedding decorations.decide if you wish to use fresh or silk flowers. fresh flowers add fragrance and a more natural look to the ceremony; silk flowers hold up better in hot weather and are available in any color. a combination of the two utilizes the best of both worlds.descriptions of floral arrangements should be written into your contract. total cost should also be included - make sure the document is complete before you sign. take care to choose a reputable, talented florist - one who can express your deepest feelings through the language of flowers.you'll want to carry a bouquet that complements your wedding gown and is scaled to your proportions. traditional bouquets are composed of all-white blooms, usualiv in a cascade style - roses, orchids, stephan-otis, lilies of the valley and gardenias are commonly used. today, brides often carry bouquets in colors taken from their wedding palette.one currently popular style is the natural-look bouquet - an airy arrangement which may include wildflowers with stems showing. this type of bouquet can be held in front or draped over the bride's arm. other favorite arrangements include a round or crescent-shaped bouquet, a nosegay, a single flower or a flower-covered prayer bookbride's throwaway bouquetalthough some brides may toss their actual bridal bouquet, most prefer to keep that arrangement. at the bouquet-tossing ceremony, a detachable section or another small bouquet may be thrown.floral headpiecesbrides often wear headpieces of orange blossoms or other light flowers, which may be real or silk. these headpieces are usually cres-cent-shaped, fitting across the head like a headband, or a circle that sits on the crown. a veil can be attached to this ornament.bride's going-away corsageafter changing into traveling clothes before leaving the reception, it is sometimes customary for the groom to present a small corsage to the bride to wear while traveling.another option: have your florist blend a honeymoon corsage into the bridal bouquet.bridal attendantsbridesmaids and maid of honor usually carry similar arrangements; the maid of honor's may be more elaborate. attendants may carry traditional bouquets, or alternative arrangements: baskets of blooms, long-stemmed flowers over one arm, or a single, perfect rose.if the bride wears a floral headpiece, attendants may wear a single bloom, spray or wreath of the same blossoms.groom and male attendantsthe groom and each male member of the wedding party, including fathers, customarily wear a boutonniere in the left lapel.traditionally, the bloom was a white rose or carnation, but as bridal bouquets have become more colorful, so have boutonnieres. the groom's boutonniere should differ from the others - he might wear a lapel spray, or a flower from the bride's bouquet.young attendantsflower girls traditionally carry baskets of loose petals to be strewn in the bride's path, but may also carry a miniature bouquet in a basket or a small nosegay. they also might wear a spray or wreath of flowers in their hair.the ring bearer should wear a boutonniere just like the groomsmen. you may wish to decorate the ringbearer's cushion with a sprig of flowersmothers, grandmothers and other very special peopleit is customary to present the mothers and grandmothers of the bridal couple with flowers to wear at the wedding. these arrangements may be made up of flowers that coordinate with their dresses; personal preferences should also be considered. if grandfathers are present, they, too, would receive boutonnieres.a corsage or boutonniere is a perfect way to honor others who contribute to your wed-ding. the guest book and gift table attendants are examples of special helpers to thank.ceremony siteflowers at the ceremony vary considerably depending on location and style of the wed-ding. if the marriage takes place in a church, at least one arrangement should decorate each side of the altar. adorn the end of each pew with ribbons and flowers,if your ceremony is held at a private home, club, hotel or other secular location, flowers and greenery are especially important. the arrangements serve as a romantic back-drop, taking the place of the church altar, and can be used to mark aisles.reception sitessome brides may wish to use the altar arrangements from the wedding to decorate the reception area; this is perfectly acceptable. others feel ceremony and reception flowers should be considered separately.church flowers should relate to the ceremony, arranged in a more serene, subtle fashion, while reception flowers would promote an unrestrained air of celebration. this is strictly a matter of personal preference.as more time is spent at the reception than at the ceremony itself, many brides elect to concentrate the majority of their decorating efforts on the party facility. centerpieces contribute greatly to the visual impact of the reception festivities.dinner and refreshment tables may hold anything from a few fresh blooms to an elaborate silk floral arrangement. candles, baskets and topiaries are often part of centerpiece arrangementshead-table centerpieces should sit low; the view of the bridal party must be unobstructed. place potted plants and ferns at either end of the receiving line to add to the ambiance of warmth and welcome as guests arrive.bouquet beautiessome brides have an absolutely specific floral arrangement in mind, complete with the coloring and types of flowers, when they choose a florist for their wedding. most others are overwhelmed with today's choices of bridal bouquet styles. arm yourself with a little flower-know-how before you visit your florist and you'll be better able to explain the flowers of your dreams!hand-tied: a method of arranging the flowers into a rounded shape and tying the stems together, covering the string with a nice ribbon - the stems are trimmed to an even length and are allowed to shownosegay: a rounded cluster of flowers hand-tied or gathered in a bouquet holdercascade: a bouquet that is anchored in a holder, with blooms, ribbons, pearls or greenery pouring over the front sidearm bunch: think of miss america - a bouquet almost looking like it was pulled right out of a garden and draped across the bride's arm, often tied with ribbon to hold the long stems together pomander ball: many flowers and greenery are attached to a ball shape, and are held by an attached ribbon

a tender moment, captured in a silver frame on an office desk. a special home movie to pop into the dvd player on a snuggly winter night. wedding pictures keep the memories alive. long after the wedding dress is packed away, the caterer is on to the next wedding, and the thank-you notes are mailed - the photographs and videos remain. the documentation of the beginning of your new family will be cherished in future generations.photographybook your photographer six months in advance to ensure he or she is available for your wedding date. when choosing a pho-tographer, there are several important things to remember.select a photographer who does weddings for a living, not as a part-time or weekend job. do not entrust this blessed event to an amateur or friend. you don't want to risk losing the recording of this once-in-a-lifetime occasion.protect your wedding memories by using a professional. and make sure he or she has extra cameras, lenses and lighting equipment on hand as back-ups in case of emergency.choose a photographer with whom you are compatible and who puts you at ease. if there is a personality conflict between you and the photographer, you may end up with photos of your best sneer instead of your best smile!look for a photographer whose judgement and opinions you trust. remember, you'll be spending a lot of time with the "cameraman" on your wedding day, relying on him or her to capture those special moments.when you meet with a photographer, view sample wedding albums to obtain a clear impression of the overall style in which the photographer covers a wedding. look for color, sharpness and detail of the photographs.determine the type of photographs you prefer - a formal posed look, candids or a combination of both formats. communicate clearly with your photographer to ensure the best results. make sure he or she knows exactly what you want - you only get one chance to make things right.obtain information on package sizes and prices, deposits, retouching charges, travel expenses and any other costs. wedding packages can range from several hundred dollars to well into the thousands. make sure everything you need is included in your package - formal portrait, black-and-white print for the news-paper, wedding album, etc. find out the cost of additional prints and "mini-albums" for parents and close friends.finally, be sure everything you've agreed to is written in a contract. other details that should be in writing include: when the photographer will arrive at the wedding and leave the reception, how he will be dressed, and the number of rolls of film that will be shot.when you meet with your photographer, come prepared with pertinent information regarding your wedding. it's also helpful if he or she knows the style, color and setting of the wedding so he or she can best capture the mood and the moment.let your photographer know the size of your wedding party, and provide him or her with a list of special friends or relatives with whom you would like to be photographed.it's helpful to designate a friend or relative to point out those people you want photographed during the reception.videographyonce a mere stepchild of photography, videography has quickly become an exciting, essential part of the wedding celebration.the guidelines for selecting a videographer parallel those for choosing a photogra-pher. the number one rule - use a profes-sional! don't be tempted to take advantage of your uncle joe's camcorder. that would be like asking your aunt ruth to take your wedding photographs with her instamatic.there are no "second takes." hire a professional with professional equipment, and your memories are safe.make sure your videographer has top-notch cameras and digital editing equipment. your videographer must be experienced and well-trained on the equipment he uses.different audio techniques include the use of wireless remote microphones the groom can wear during the ceremony to capture your vows, a feed from the church's sound system, a shotgun microphone and ambient sound, and a separate recording dubbed in during editing. determine with your videographer the technique best suited to your wedding location. remember, not all locations are flexible about where the videographer may stand or set up an additional camera during the cer-emony. be sure to go over the locations guidelines with the videographer.ask to view dvds of actual weddings that were shot and produced within the past year. by watching these, you'll see first-hand the videographer's level of talent and profes-sionalism.look for sharp images, adequate lighting and clear sound. the video should flow smoothly from scene to scene, with highlights fully covered to tell the whole wedding story. look for special effects, such as fades, wipes, dissolves, multiple images, freeze-frames and background music.the videographer should dress appropri-ately, and you should feel comfortable having him mingle with your guests. wedding videography prices range from several hundred dollars to the thousands. find out what's included in the package deals, and if items such as duplicate dvds, adding music and titles, special effects, overtime and second cameras are additional. obtain a contract including date, time, location, cost, equipment used, editing time, deposits and delivery date.it's so important to choose professionals to record your wedding celebration. the expense is well worth the future returns.preserving the memories of your nuptials is too important to leave to chance. take care to ensure that your photographs and videos are of the quality you'll be proud to share with your family and friends. you'll enjoy your memories for many years to come.

    thank-you notes
  















so many people will make your wedding-day dreams come true: your family, friends, co-workers and wedding professionals. what better way to single them out for their hard work than to send a heart-felt "thank you."choose formal thank-you note paper for both of you, since your groom will be writing many of the thank-yous. your note paper may be engraved with your new address, in which case you could use it after the wedding. city and state names are printed out in full with no abbreviation. a street number may be spelled out or shown in  numerals. stationery imprinted with your married name or initials is never used until after the wedding.one final, important reminder to help your wedding run smoothly: make sure each piece mailed has sufficient postage. it would be terribly embarrassing if your invitations and thank-you notes were returned by the post office!

    intriguing invitations
  


a wedding invitation peeking out of the mailbox is always a pleasant sight. make sure your message expresses the warmth and happiness you wish to share with your guests.












a wedding invitation peeking out of the mailbox is always a pleasant sight. make sure your message expresses the warmth and happiness you wish to share with your guests.as with every aspect of planning a wedding, traditional guidelines exist for wording, paper and engraving of wedding invitations and announce-ments. many couples, however, come up with informal and creative variations.a very formal wedding still commands the use of very proper wording engraved on thick, creamy paper. a less formal celebration might call for pastel ink on parchment.the guest listafter you've decided on a budget and the number of guests to invite, ask your fiancé and his family to make up their list. let them know how many you hope they'll invite. normally, each family invites half the guests. another option: divide the guest list into three sections. the groom's family, the bride's family and the bridal couple each invite a third. as a rule of thumb, expect about three-fourths of those invited to attend.invitations should be sent to your wedding officiant and spouse, your fiance's immediate family, and members of your wedding party and their parents. you are not obligated to invite companions for single friends on your list.if you do wish to invite the friend or fiancé of a single guest, ask for that person's name and address and send a separate invitation. if the couple lives together, mail a joint invitation, as you would for a married couple.while drawing up your invitation list, put together your announcement list. this list should include acquaintances not invited to the wedding with whom you wish to share the good news. neither an invitation nor announcement requires a gift - feel free to send them to everyone. order 50 to 100 extra invitations and envelopes to allow for addressing mistakes.paper and printingwhile handwritten invitations are appropriate for a small ceremony - 50 guests or less - for a larger wedding, you'll want printed invitations.a classic formal invitation is printed or engraved on the top page of a folded sheet of white or off-white paper. a small inner envelope, ungummed and unscaled, encloses the invitation or announcement. this is placed inside a larger envelope which is addressed and stamped.add a personal touch to your invitations using translucent or shiny paper, colored ink or a special border. if you select colored ink, use the same shade to address the envelopes. select someone with beautiful handwriting, perhaps a professional calligrapher, to address envelopes or write invitations.order invitations and announcements at least three months before the wedding to allow time for printing, addressing and mailing. engraving may take longer. have the envelopes delivered early for addressing ahead of time.addressingcompose a master list on index cards; make sure all names and titles are spelled correctly. address all invitations by hand, in blue, blue-black or black ink; never use a typewriter.the only abbreviations used are mr., mrs., ms., je. and dr. most elected officials are addressed as the honorable; the clergy as the reverend father, or rabbi; and high-rank-ing military personnel as commander, colonel, etc. a single woman, even a child, is addressed as miss or ms. young boys are addressed as master. try to avoid nicknames or initials. spell out streets, cities and states in full, and don't forget zip codes.if several members of a family are invited, avoid using the phrase "and family." you want each person to feel the invitation is meant especially for them. on the inner envelope, include the name of each child invited:mr. and mrs. mcbride abigail and davidadult members of a family should receive separate invitations, whether or not they live with their parents. send one joint invitation to two brothers or two sisters living at the same address.invitations should be mailed 4 to 6 weeks before the ceremony. two months is courteous if you plan to marry during the holidays.allow people time to consider your invitation and word their replies. depending upon the formality of your invitation, they'll respond with formal written acceptances or regrets, informal notes, phone calls or response cards.if you haven't had a response from a guest two weeks before the wedding, call and check. when each invitation is accounted for, tell your caterer how many guests to expect.formal announcements, created in the style of your invitation, should be mailed the day of the wedding or immediately afterward. ask a bridesmaid or family member to do this if you don't have time.keeping trackas soon as your invitations are sent, you'll begin receiving calls and notes from guests. saying they can hardly wait. promptly record who's coming, and who won't be able to attend. allow space in your filing system to describe gifts received, and make a notation when a thank-you note is sent.special enclosuresenclosures are printed in the same style as the invitation itself. at-home cards may be enclosed with formal invitations, but are usually sent with announcements. these are small cards informing everyone of your new address and the date you'll be ready to receive mail and visitors there.ceremony cards are sent if there's a chance that uninvited persons may try to attend, or if the wedding is held in a public or historic place. engraved cards may be enclosed with the invitations, to be presented at the door for admittance. for other types of enclosures you may wish to ask your printer, stationery or wedding consultant.wedding programsa program is extremely helpful in guiding your guests through the ceremony and is a wonderful memento of your wedding. it provides vital information and might be an elaborate booklet, a calligraphy-inscribed scroll, or a preprinted wedding bulletin with your wedding service photocopied inside.announcementsnormally, announcements are not mailed to anyone who has been invited to the wedding. but they may go out after an intimate ceremony for family only, after an elopement, or a wedding so far away that many people could not attend. business associates with whom the couple work day to day might also receive announcements. (remember, no one receiving an announcement need feel obligated to send a gift.)printing and paper for the announcements are the same as for invitations. announcements should be addressed like invitations and, whenever possible, mailed out immediately after the ceremony.

    exceptional receptions
  


no matter how informal the party, there's more to planning your reception and rehearsal dinner than just the menu. plan an event they won't soon forget. as you dig through these pages, you will be inspired.












no matter how informal the party, there's more to planning your reception and rehearsal dinner than just the menu. plan an event they won't soon forget. as you dig through these pages, you will be inspired.planning the big party - your wedding reception can seem overwhelming, but never fear. start with the basic guidelines, and let your creative juices flow.your reception could include a formal sit-down dinner or an authentic texas barbeque. have the party at a first-class hotel, or take your guests on a riverboat cruise. hire a disc jockey or a 30-piece orchestra for your dancing pleasure. the choices are unlimited - you can fashion the festivities to fit your personality and your budget.popular locations for receptions include hotels, restaurants and private clubs. these party places can often provide the complete facilities and food services you require. other options to consider: private homes, church halls, fraternal organizations, park pavilions and art galleries. if your reception site doesn't offer all the services you need, find a competent wedding consultant, caterer or party rental store that can provide food, equipment and staffing.it's important to be well-informed when you plan your reception. in order to negotiate with caterers, hoteliers, entertainers, and the like, you'll need to provide them with some basic information. essential data includes the date of the event, how many guests you expect, your budget range, and the reception style you're planning.after you've told your story, find out what you need to know:what's the facility rental fee?﻿﻿what's included in the cost?﻿﻿how many guests can the space accommodate (including table and chair availability)?﻿﻿how long does the fee reserve the space, and what are the overtime charges?what time can set-up begin?what time must the space be vacated?﻿﻿who's responsible for cleanup?﻿﻿how far in advance must reservations be made?﻿﻿are parking, restroom and changing room facilities adequate?﻿﻿are air, heating and electrical (outlet) systems adequate?is the dance floor adequate?﻿﻿can you review staging, lighting, audio and video needs?is there a public address system or microphone available?is it necessary to use in-house catering; if so, will beverages and hors d'oeuvres be served before dinner?are security guards, coat check, parking atten-dants, bartenders and similar services providedhow much is the deposit; when is it due; when is the remainder due?what is the cancellation policy and is their liability insurance adequate?﻿﻿is there a security deposit; if so, when will it be refunded?are there special rules and regulations that may affect the party?it's important to plan at least nine months in advance. book your reception site as soon as you set the big date. if your location is in demand, you may have to set the wedding date around its availability.if an outdoor wedding and reception is on your agenda, consider the possibility of inclement weather. rent a tent or arrange for a back-up inside site - you don't want your party called off because of rain!now that you know how to book your reception, you may have questions about what goes on at this once-in-a-lifetime event. read on for details about the order of activities at the reception, and other guidelines to follow when planning your festivitiesreception stylesthe time and formality of your wedding determines what kind of reception will follow. early morning breakfast gathering at a local restaurant. it's unnecessary to serve alcoholic beverages at this early hour.afternoon (2 p.m. to 5 p.m.)afternoon tea; serve coffee, tea or punch with light hors d'oeuvres.late afternoon (4 p.m. to 6 p.m.)cocktail party; feature 11 to 12 varieties of hot and cold hors d'oeuvres. alcoholic beverages are served - an open bar is usually provided.eveningserve a full meal; a cocktail hour often precedes dinner. anything from a buffet to a sit-down meal is appropriate.reception timetablehere is a basic guide to the timeframe of a typical wedding reception.upon arrival at reception sitebridal party forms the receiving line. guests pass through into the reception area where drinks and hors d'oeuvres are waiting.after 1 hourbuffet or dinner is served; the best man starts the toasting by offering the first good wishes to the bride and groom.after 1 1/2 hoursthe first course is cleared from the head table; the first dance begins. guests then join in the dancing.after 2 hourstables are cleared of food; it's time to cut the cake!the last half hourthe bouquet and garter are thrown; the grand march (optional) takes place. the bride and groom bid farewell to their guests.receiving linethe receiving line allows parents and principals to greet guests and receive their good wishes. the line usually begins just inside the reception site; it may also be held at the church immediately following the wedding ceremony.a church reception line is appropriate when not all guests are invited to the reception.an alternative way to greet guests at the church: the bride and groom re-enter after the recessional, greeting guests as they file out. this method is appropriate if the gathering is not too large, and eliminates awkwardness if parents are divorced or don't wish to participate in a formal receiving line.in a traditional receiving line, the mother of the bride, as hostess, is first to greet guests. following her are the groom's mother, the bride, the groom, and maid of honor. fathers of the bride and groom, the best man, bridesmaids and groomsmen may also be included. children in the wedding party do not stand in the receiving line.make sure guests sign your guest book before they enter the receiving line. place an attendant near the book to remind them to sign. guests should move quickly down the line, saving conversation for later, as the bride and groom visit each table. after all guests have arrived, the line dis-perses. the bridal couple takes their place at the head table.some couples elect to eliminate the receiving line, circulating with their guests throughout the reception instead.seating arrangementsplace cards should be set at the head table and honor tables to avoid confusion and embarrassment. the caterer or maid of honor places the cards before the reception. at the rest of the tables, allow guests to choose their own seats.the head table showcases the bride and groom, who sit in full view, facing the guests. the best man flanks the bride, while the maid of honor is seated next to the groom. bridesmaids and groomsmen are seated, alternating males and females.at a small wedding, the parents of the bride and groom may sit at the head table, as well as the officiating clergy and spouses of married attendants. otherwise, there is a separate honors table, with the bride's parents at opposite ends. the groom's father sits to the right of the bride's moth-er; the wedding officiant to her left. the groom's mother sits to the right of the bride's father, the wedding officiant's spouse to his left.you may also arrange two parents' tables, with the bride's parents at one, while the groom's mother and father head the other. in this arrangement, more friends and relatives may be given a seat of honor at these tables.divorced parents should be seated at separate tables, among their own friends and family. seat the groom's parents with the family that raised the bride. the bride and groom will divide their time between each group.cutting the cakethe cutting of the wedding cake is a charming ritual, and the highlight of the reception. guests are signaled by the best man tapping his glass, or a burst of fanfare from the band. using a silver knife with a beribboned handle, the bride, the groom's hand placed over hers, cuts the first slice.he offers her a bite, and she presents a piece for him to sample, symbolizing their willingness to share their lives. the rest of the cake is sliced by an attendant and served as dessert.it's an extra treat to have a groom's cake - usually a chocolate cake - contrasting with the white, elaborately iced wedding cake. the groom's cake may also be served for dessert, or packed in small white boxes for guests to take home as a memento.dancingif a reception features a buffet, the bride and groom may dance their first dance as soon as they've recovered from the rigors of the receiving line. when a full meal is served, dancing begins after the last course is cleared.after the newlyweds begin the first dance, others may join in as follows:second couplethe bride's father cuts in and dances with his daughter.third couplethe groom asks the mother of the bride to dance.fourth couplethe groom's father dances with the bride.fifth couplethe father of the bride cuts in on the groom and dances with the bride's mother.sixth couplethe groom dances with his mother.none of the first couples must dance a full dance. after a few minutes, other guests are invited to join in the dancing. ethnic dancing may be featured, or have fun with the dollar dance - guests pay the bride and groom a dollar for a dance. a grand march may also be formed well into the reception.as the activities end, a second receiving line is formed beside a small table filled with cake boxes, cigars or a last drink for the guests as they depart. this gives guests a chance to say goodbye to the newlyweds, who then have a last dance and prepare to depart on their honeymoon.tossing the bouquet and garterthe bouquet and garter are usually tossed before the bride and groom change into their travel clothes. the best man and the maid of honor gather the single men and women in a semicircle. the bride tosses the bouquet over her shoulder - the lucky girl who catches it is supposedly the next to be married. the groom tosses the bride's garter into the crowd of bachelors; the recipient, according to the myth, will become the next bridegroom.leaving the receptionafter the bouquet and garter ceremony, the bride and groom change clothes and bid a private farewell to their parents. in a shower of rice, birdseed or rose petals, the happy couple heads for their car, which has probably been skillfully decorated by the ushers. the newlyweds are off on their honeymoon, ready to start their new life together.catering connection: food for thoughtwining and dining your wedding guests takes the largest bite out of your wedding budget. a well-planned reception is crucial to the success of your marriage cele-bration. choose your caterer with care - a talented, well-organized culinary artist can create a fabulous feast you'll never forget.if you've chosen a hotel or restaurant for your reception site, they'll probably provide their own food and beverage services. if you've chosen a different type of facility - church hall, park pavilion, etc. - you'll need to arrange for catering.book catering services well in advance; six to nine months before the wedding is ideal. give your caterer the pertinent data - date and time, place, reception style, budget and the number of guests attending. for food ser-vice, most caterers charge a flat fee per person; liquor costs are usually by the bottle or per drink. waiters may be paid by the hour.your caterer can help you determine the kind of food to serve, and provide dishware, ice, glasses, etc. he or she can usually arrange for servers, bartenders and valet parking services as well. be sure charges for these services are included in your cost estimate. check to see if gratuities are automatically added to the final bill.your contract should specify the food and beverages to be served and the guest count. look into postponement and cancellation policies before you sign. a deposit is usually required when you sign the contract.by all means, comparison shop - it's important to get the most for your money. just make sure the caterer you choose has a reputation for quality and service - the success of your reception depends on it!i’ll drink to that: the tradition of toastsno matter how informal the party may be - it's traditional to toast the bride and groom at their wedding reception. the festive air that toasting lends to pre- or post-wed-ding celebrations creates a feeling of shared good will for everyone present. toasts are a tribute to the bridal couple and the wedding party.champagne is usually used for toasting - the bubbly brew is synonymous with romance and gaiety. if alcohol is not a part of this party, well wishers can toast with sparkling cider or ginger ale.toasting can begin after the receiving line breaks up, and can be made all throughout the reception. at a less formal function, toasts are presented just before the cutting of the cakethe best man acts as master of ceremonies, offering the first toast. this toast may be just for the bride, or aimed at both newlyweds. the best man gets everyone's attention by clinking on his glass. he may introduce himself and others in the wedding party, and explain his relationship to the newly-weds. at this time he may tell an amusing anecdote about the bridal couple, making a wish for their future happiness.the toast may be in the form of a poem, quotation or the like - it should be brief and sincere. those offering toasts should plan what they wish to say ahead of time. it's important to speak loudly and clearly when making the toast - everyone wants to hear this!after the best man's tribute, the groom usually responds with toasts honoring his wife, parents and new in-laws. the bride may then rise to offer toasts to her husband, the couple's families, attendants and guests. (a special thank-you is expressed particularly well in the form of a toast.) the fathers of the bride and groom may propose toasts to their new son and daughter, and other members of the wedding party may then offer their own toasts.when you're the object of a toast, remain seated, and don't sip from your glass - you're allowed to imbibe between toasts. smile and nod at whoever is offering the toast.the tradition of toasting is one to treasure - long after your wedding day, you'll look back and smile when you think of those special words: the funny stories the best man told about you; the love your parents expressed as they welcomed your spouse into the family.above all, remember the tide of good wishes from all those present as they raised their glasses and drank to your happiness during every toast that was madetoasts with the mostbest man to couple"and now, ladies and gentlemen, i shall ask you to rise." give guests adequate time to respond. if they are already standing, say "i now ask you to raise your glasses." turning to the couple, say: "may your wedding day be the threshold of a wonderful future of sharing as you walk together through life, hand in hand. to jane and john."groom to bride"here's to the prettiest, here's to the wittiest, here's to the truest one of all who are true, here's to the neatest one, here's to the sweetest one, here's to them all in one here's to you.”bride to groom"i wonder if you realize how much you mean to me, how wonderful you've been, how dear you'll always be. you've brought such love and happiness into my life. no wonder i'm so thankful and so proud to be your wife. to john!"bride's father to couple"to jane and john. may your lives be full of the kind of happiness we are enjoying here today."bride to parents"to my new family, with thanks for raising such a loving and supportive person, and to my parents, for all the love and strength they've given me. may we all have many, many more memorable days together."

look your best! feel your best! it’s the most important day for your looks. learn how to “wow” him while feeling your very best.












look your best! feel your best! it’s the most important day for your looks. learn how to “wow” him while feeling your very best.on the morning of the day of your wedding, you'll wake up knowing that the cake will be delivered on time, that the reception hall will be completely decorated and waiting for your arrival, and that your dress will fit you perfectly. and you'll be confident that you'll look radiant and feel wonderful because professional makeup and hair artists will spend the time to soothe your nerves by accentuating all of your best features.several types of makeup artists and hair stylists are out there, and to be sure you choose the right types for you, you'll need to know a bit about them first.makeup artistryprofessional makeup artists have experience with all skin types and colorings, face shapes, and hair shapes. a licensed esthetician is one who has studied skin and skin care, has hours of training, is skilled in the sterilization process (to eliminate cross-contamination from tools), and has much practice and work experience with actual people. these exceptional artists have the talent and training to camouflage any scars or blemishes and to bring out your best facial features.you may wonder why you need a professional to do something for you that you do for yourself almost every day. after all, you can do your makeup just fine for everyday wear, and sometimes even for special occasions. but consider this: what will you remember the most - how you know you looked on your wedding day, or how you looked in your photographs from your wedding day? trained makeup artists know how to make you look good, not only in person, but for photography, such as those endearing wedding photographs. makeup for photography is a learned skill and one most women don't have.in planning what you want to look like, don't forget your eyebrows! they can make all the difference in a polished look. if your brows look good and are shaped to complement your eyes, your whole face will look more finished.have a professional do this. as often women tweeze too many hairs out of their brows and come away with having to resort to pencil lines.hair artistrymany, many things can go wrong when people try to not only style their own hair, but also use harsh chemicals at home, trying to "look like the woman on the box." a trained colorist has the chemistry knowledge to change the color of your hair slightly or altogether differently, while still making it look as natural as if you were born with it. some eager people even try perming or straightening their own hair at home, and some of these people have horror stories to tell. rather than becoming a casualty, hire a professional to design the look that's right for you and your hair.if you're one of the lucky women who has long, healthy hair, there are countless ways your hair can be styled. be sure the hair artist in which you are interested has experience with long hair, whether you just want it styled or want a chemical process. it behaves nothing like short hair, and if you mess it up at home, it just takes that much longer to grow it back out to the same length again.schedulingabout six months before your wedding you'll want to start a skin-care program designed especially for you - and stick with it! during stressful times your skin can do all sorts of panicking on its own, so if you start being good to it you shouldn’t have as many problems when that special day arrives. licensed estheticians can help devise such a regimen with you and can lead the way to healthy skin.if you are considering changing the look of your hair, whether it be the cut, style, color or texture, now is the time to book those appoint-ments, too, so the person working on your hair can have the time to perfect your new look before the last minute.it is wise to choose your hair and makeup artists early so that you'll be working with the same people throughout the whole process; firstly because they will become familiar with your skin and hair, and secondly, when you look back at the photographs you will be looking at your wedding as an event, rather than something occurring over a few months, and you'll want to have the same look in all of them. be sure to make all the necessary appointments to lead up to your wedding day. and don't forget to include the appointments for that day, too! some artists work only in their own studios, others will go on-loca-tion and meet you where you need to be. make sure you confirm all of your plans with everyone involved.once it gets closer to your wedding date, about 3-4 months prior to your wedding or when your tailored gown arrives, you'll be having your bridal portrait taken. make sure you confirm how long it will take for hair and makeup so you won't be rushed trying to make the photographer's appointment. another good tip is to book a "trial run" appointment with both the makeup and hair people before your portrait day so they can decide how to make you look your best without your trying to race out the door. be sure to bring your headpiece to all appointments so they can work around it.about a month before the big day is the time to have any processes done to your hair that you are needing. you may think that this is too early, but in actuality, it is the prime time to have these processes done, so your hair will have a chance to get reconditioned and healthier after-ward. have all of your hair touch-ups done about a week before the weddingwhen that day finally arrives and you wake up in the morning, you can be assured that everything - absolutely everything - has been taken care of for you, and there isn't a single thing for you to worry about. your skin and hair will be planned for, just as you planned everything else. good skin care, makeup applied by a professional, and hair styled to perfection will not only help you look your very best, but will help ease that last-minute stress. after all, a relaxed bride is a beautiful bride. so enjoy a nice breakfast and get ready for the time of your life!

a wedding ring is an endless circle that traditionally represents the love that you, the bride and groom, have for each other. it is wise to make a careful selection of these immortal tokens of love.


a wedding ring is an endless circle that traditionally represents the love that you, the bride and groom, have for each other. it is wise to make a careful selection of these immortal tokens of love.since you are unique, your wedding rings should portray your uniqueness. choosing or designing your rings can be one of the most pleasurable experiences of your engagement. the variety of styles is endless. many couples prefer to visit the jeweler together to learn about each others' style preferences. your jeweler can advise you on the style and design most becoming to your lifestyle and tastes.decide if you prefer a single wedding band, a wedding ring with a matching engagement ring, or an engagement ring with guard rings. other decisions that will need to be made are what type, size and shape of gem you prefer; whether or not you would like smaller diamonds on your band to accentuate your main stone; and if you would like your fiance's ring to match.after you have searched for the ultimate rings and have found them, congratulations!if you cannot find the perfect rings for you, then commission your jeweler to custom design and create an original set of wedding rings for you. a custom jeweler can create magic by simply learning your preferences and designing your rings according to your liking. the jeweler will then hand carve and create your perfect rings.diamonds are an important part of engagement and wedding rings. you need to know a few basic facts and standards for diamonds. the most widely accepted diamond grading standards were established by the gemological institute of america (gia), and the basic concepts can be mastered by you with the help of your jeweler. diamond grading is divided into the four cs: carat, cut, clarity, and color.carat refers to the weight of a diamond. one carat weight is divided into 100 points of weight. a 25-point diamond can be referred to as a stone that weighs 0.25 carats. size is determined by the weight and is also a factor in the price of a diamond because the larger the dia-mond, and the heavier it is, the more rare the stone, and the more valuable it becomes.cut refers to the make and shape of your dia-mond. the make is the faceting or cutting of the diamond surface. most round diamonds have 58 facets. a good cut, or make, allows for the maximum light reflection throughout the diamond. some diamonds are cut shallow, some deep, while the superbly cut diamond achieves the most brilliance.the shape of the diamond is also a part of the cut. the most common shapes include the round brilliant, marquis, pear, oval, heart, emer-ald, and baguette. diamond shapes are not limited to these. diamonds have been cut in the design of stars, flowers, tree, and even the shape of texas.clarity refers to the ability to see through a diamond, which is affected by internal identifying characteristics of flaws formed in nature in the diamond. the fewer and less visible the flaws, known as inclusions, the better and more valuable the diamond becomes. diamonds are graded on 10x magnification under a microscope or jewler;s loupe, with good lighting. it is important to examine your major diamond purchase under a microscope so that you can see the flaws, their sizes, and locations.overall, the fewer the inclusions, the more brilliant and valuable the diamond.alternatives to diamondsanother idea to consider when discussing your rings is the use of alternative stones instead of a diamond. the main reason that diamonds are the choice of most couples can be attributed to the fact that diamonds are the hardest stone known to man, thus they are better able to withstand the stress of daily wear. a myth exists about diamonds that they cannot be chipped nor can they break. but beware ... it is a myth. a diamond, like all gemstones, must be properly cared for by you.on a regular basis, preferably at least once every six months, ask your jeweler to clean and inspect your rings and stones so that you can maintain their glowing beauty. in between your visits to your jeweler, it does help to clean your wedding rings as often as you wish. your jeweler can advise you as to the best way to clean your rings at home. the cleaner your rings are, the more they sparkle, and the more your friends will notice them.colored gemstones, such as ruby and sapphire, have also been used throughout history as a wedding ring center stone or as an enhancement to the center diamond. for example, you may choose an intense blue sapphire as your center stone and encircle it with smaller diamonds.after you receive your rings from your jeweler, you should check with your insurance agent as to how to insure your rings on your insurance policy. inquire about an all-risk policy to fully insure your rings. your insurance agent can give explanations and suggestions as to the best protection for you.other wedding jewelryyour jeweler can assist you with other wedding jewelry, such as cultured pearls. this is a traditional wedding gift given by the groom to the bride to wear with her wedding gown. pearls are an elegant jewelry gift and may be enjoyed for many occasions.the bride may appropriately choose a set of cufflinks or button covers as her gift to her groom to wear with his formal attire at the wedding and for future occasions. your jeweler can guide you in making your choices.check with your jeweler for bridesmaids' and groomsmen's gift ideas and give a gift that will remind them of the special day they will share with you.choosing your wedding and engagement rings can be fun and exciting! with the professional guidance of your jeweler, your wedding rings will become cherished reminders of the love you share.

dreaming about the perfect wedding is one thing - actually paying for it is another. establish a realistic budget up front, and you’ll be able to create an affordable fantasy.


dreaming about the perfect wedding is one thing - actually paying for it is another. establish a realistic budget up front, and you’ll be able to create an affordable fantasy.you are in love - it's the real thing. now that you've found your partner in life, you want to share your happiness with everyone. you want your wedding celebration to be the talk of the town - the biggest and best ever.before your fantasies get ahead of your checkbook, ask yourself: who's paying for this wedding, and how much can you afford to spend?traditionally, the bride's parents paid the majority of the wedding costs. back in the old days, the groom assumed full financial responsibility for his bride after they rode off into the sunset. he didn't have to chip in much for the wedding - he paid his share later.it's a different story now. both partners in a modern marriage tend to go back to work after the honeymoon, and these newlyweds have a bit more financial independence. it seems only natural for both families to contribute to the wedding celebration.decide the kind of wedding you'd like. discuss your plans with those contributing to the cost, and determine a budget. make everyone's financial limitations clear at this point - it will prevent hard feelings later.some ballpark figures to work with: expect a semi formal ceremony to cost between $6,000 and $7,500. a formal wedding ranges from $10,000 to $15,000, while and ultra formal ceremony can run $40,000 or more.the largest single expense you're faced with is the reception. festivities at private clubs and four-star restaurants are pricier than those held in the church fellowship hall. check rates at several types of reception sites. - you will find one within your budget.many facilities offer excellent package deals. you'll find everything completely organized, from tea and sandwiches at the church to a formal sit-down dinner complete with orchestra. purchasing services separately is a lot of work! many couples opt for at least a partial package - it saves time and energy.costs for the reception room itself vary.prices range from free to several hundred dollars per hour. professional planners suggest the reception last from 3 to 31/2 hours. any shorter, and people who've traveled from afar may feel cheated. any longer, and guests tend to break up into cliques.whether or not to serve a meal - that depends on your finances and what is expected in your community. many ethnic and religious cultures traditionally celebrate with a hearty meal. if many of your guests have traveled a long distance, it's hospitable to feed them.if you plan your wedding during mealtimes, you are expected to provide sustenance. if this creates a fiscal panic, change your reception style, or invite fewer guests. one workable option - plan a large reception with light refreshments, then ask close family, friends and out-of-town guests to your parents' house for a buffet dinner.food and beverage costs vary greatly. a hot cocktail buffet may run from $8 to $40 per per-son. buffet dinners range from $15 to $40 per guest; a sit-down diner, $25 to $60 per person.caterers' estimates usually include the cost of beverages, but do make sure. some caterers include champagne and beer and wine, but charge extra for mixed drinks at an open bar.you may pay for drinks individually, or include the libations in the caterer's package. most professionals offer reasonable prices - they get it wholesale.with careful planning and a lot of investigating, you and your family can host the wedding you've always wanted - without ruining your budget. and you can go on dreaming about how special your wedding day will be.

    musical notes
  


oh, how you’ll dance, on the night you are wed… music sets the mood for your personal celebration - from the first note of the processional to the last dance at your reception.












oh, how you’ll dance, on the night you are wed… music sets the mood for your personal celebration - from the first note of the processional to the last dance at your reception.at countless wedding ceremonies, wagner’s “the bridal chorus” from lohengrin (“here comes the bride”) is the processional song of choice. mendelssohn’s “wedding march” from “a midsummer night’s dream” is often played during the recessional. it’s traditional right?not always. those matrimonial melodies are considered to be too secular by many churches - you might not be allowed to play those traditional tunes as you walk down the aisle. if you’re planning a religious ceremony, consult your clergy on appropriate music selections. the type of music played at your wedding is a matter of personal choice. while there may be some restrictions due to religious considerations, there is an abundance of music appropriate to any style of ceremony. enlist the aid of your church organist, clergy, choir director or bridal coordinator in making musical decisions.your ceremony might feature an organist, pianist, harpist, string or woodwind quartet, or vocal performer. the musical program should begin 15 to 30 minutes before the ceremony, as guests arrive.at the rehearsal, you may want to spend a little time practicing walking to the music you have chosen. wedding music is highly emotional, and many brides have cried their way to the altar because of the sudden effect music has had on them. it might also be a good idea to tell your father you need to practice walking on his arm to the music; this will give him a chance to get used to it, too. elaborate wedding walks are unpopular today, but a lovely bride will want to have an aura of confidence about her ability to float down the aisle to the music she has chosen.select a professional march that’s joyous, yet dignified. your recessional music should be livelier in tempo - after all, you’ve just been married!beyond “the bridal chorus” from lohengrin (“here comes the bride”) and mendelssohn’s “wedding march”, here are some options for the ceremony:for the processional:couperin’s “fanfare”clarke’s “prince of denmark’s march”handels’s “sarabande” - suite no. 11during the ceremony:pachelbel’s “canon in d minor”bach’s “jesu, joy of man’s desiring”mendelssohn’s “first organ sonata”bernstein and sndheim’s “one hand, one heart”malottes’s “the lord’s prayer”for the recessional:buxtehude’s “fugue in c minor”mouret’s “rondo”simon and garfunkel’s “benedictus”reception selectionsmusic sets the mood for your reception - consider your selections carefully. you might have dj spinning discs, or a jazz musician tickling the ivories. a 30-piece orchestra or a rowdy rock band might play “your song”. just remember to feature a variety of music - slow romantic numbers as well as rousing dance tunes. music should entertain both younger and older guests. plan some selections for dancing, others just for listening. the music shouldn’t be so loud as to hinder conversation. at a small wedding, a pianist or jazz trio is a good choice. a “wedding band” is a popular choice - they’re trained to play to all different age groups. a dj is usually a very economical choice. these entertainers can provide a great variety of music, from rock & roll to waltzes. many disc jockeys can also provide lighting effects.when interviewing musicians, find out the size of the group, the instruments played, and whether or not they feature vocalists. ask the musicians or dj for a current song list. you’ll want to have a large variety of music to choose from, including selections from the following categories: top 40, broadway show tunes, ballads, rock & roll, latin rhythms, fox trots, tangos, and waltzes. if possible, catch them in a live situation for a sneak preview of their performance style.music sets the mood for your reception - consider your selections carefully. you might have dj spinning discs, or a jazz musician tickling the ivories. make sure the entertainment can accommodate your personal preferences. indicate songs you’d like played during special moments. you might request one of the groom’s favorite tunes as the wedding party sits down to dinner. “the anniversary song” or “the girl that i marry” are meaningful choices for the first dance between the new husband and wife. music is also played during the cake-cutting, when the bride’s bouquet and garter are tossed, and to signal the bride and groom’s leave-taking.you should expect a professional attitude and appearance in the entertainment you hire. ask if one of the band members or dj can act as the master of ceremonies if you need one. determine how long the band plays (usually, 45-minutes sets, flowed with 15-minute breaks). make sure they can provide recorded music during breaks. from setting up the musical equipment to tearing it back down, the band or dj will spend four to six hours at your reception, and they will get hungry. it’s customary to provide them with refreshments - sandwiches, non-alcoholic beverages, or a plate from the buffet. a happy band or dj contributes greatly to the festive mood of your party.inform the entertainment manager whom to contact at the reception site so he or she can check out the facilities ahead of time for acoustics, lighting arrangements, etc. if you’re planning an outdoor reception, decide where the party will move in case of rain. don’t leave any of the details to chance r memory - write them down in a contract. your contract with the entertainment should include: the date, time, location, set-up time, number and length of sets, payment, overtime fees, cancellation and postponement policies, entertainer’s attire, and any special considerations.
