appleton camping center
over 60 years in business
at appleton camping center our customers know first hand that when they walk through our doors they are getting more than just a great rv... they're getting a lifestyle that is backed by the most reliable support available. founded in 1964, the family here at appleton has helped thousands of happy people fulfill their camping dreams with everything from folding camper to travel trailers to fifth wheel to luxury motorhome. we began as merely a part time business in the early days and, as increased demand spawned rapid growth, we moved to several locations around town. now we are one of, if not, the biggest and most respected rv dealerships in wisconsin!
we're a proud member of the route 66 rv network, the largest network of independently owned rv dealers in the us and canada.
