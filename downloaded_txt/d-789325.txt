reviews
















sweet songs jungle lodge






“we loved it! my sisters and i spent several days here, enjoying the scenery, food and facilities. we had the package that included meals, which we found very enjoyable! we enjoyed every one of our meals in the outdoor restaurant/bar, watching toucans and other birds flitting about! several excursions were arraigned for us including a visit to tikal and atm cave which were amazing!! we tubed down the river and enjoyed bird watching in the botanic gardens that were adjacent to our cabin! the only issue was we did not give ourselves enough time at the lodge to enjoy everything we wanted to do. we may have to return!!”123cyndie from tripadvisor
