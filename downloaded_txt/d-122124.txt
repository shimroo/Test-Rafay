find a vinyl fence installer:
if you don’t want to do it yourself here’s how our customers have found good local installers and some things to avoid.
there are many installers in your market who do a very good job of installing fence. if they’re a fence company they will try to sell you their product. if they’re a landscape company or a contractor, they’ll likely install the fence you provide, (which you bought at wholesale from us), and remove the old fence if needed. we suggest that you contact some of the local contractors and landscape companies and see if they would install a fence for you if you provided the material from bufftech.
if the installer you select follows the installation instructions we provide, bufftech will warrant the product for the lifetime of the original purchaser and warrant the installation for 5 years.
another method is to get a list of possible fence installers from your local big box store. many of these installers will install other brands of fence for you if you provide the material. when you call the installer, simply ask if they can install a fence for you other than one provided by the big box store if that’s what you chose. if so, invite them to bid on your project. print out the installation instructions on our site and give them a copy when they come to measure.
feel free to compare our fence for quality and price with any big box store. we think you’ll choose us for several reasons.




why we’re better than home depot and lowes
here are 6 simple reasons why people buy from us instead of their local big box store.

save the sales tax. in most states we don’t have to charge a sales tax. (no sales tax states: al, ak, az, ar, co, de, ga, hi, id, il, in, ia, ky, mi, mn, mo, mt, ne, nv, nh, nj, ny, nd, oh, ok, or, pa, ri, sc, sd, tx, ut, vt, va, wa, wi.)
better customer service. our people know fence and will give you the very best information available. all your questions will be answered quickly and directly without a sales pitch. the employees at the big box stores do the best they can but they don’t have the background to give you complete educated and up to date information.
better replacement and repair resource. if you ever need to replace a section of fence or add onto an existing project you will be more likely to find the resources you need here with us. as you know, home depot, lowes and the other big box stores change vendors frequently. that means when you go back to get additional parts and pieces they often do not carry that line anymore or the manufacturer they used is no longer available. we have customers call often who are looking for parts to replace fences they bought at the home depot or lowes that are broken or are now obsolete and no longer available though we usually can’t help them. we’ll likely be able to get you what you want for a repair or replacement if you got it from us originally.
our material is of a much higher quality. there are no brackets to break or screws to strip or loosen and lose, no wood to put inside the posts for strength, no cheap shortcuts in engineering and construction. our posts are pre-routed and the rails easily slide into the posts and lock into place. all our privacy styles include galvanized steel inserts in the rails so the fences will never sag, rot or warp. it’s all made right here in the u.s.a. and not in china or russia so it’s providing american jobs and here when you need it. home depot and lowe’s on the other hand usually buy from whoever has the lowest price.
best warranty in the business. your transferrable lifetime warranty is backed by bufftech corporation whose been in business over 110 years. if there ever is a problem, they’ll be there to step up to the plate. in almost 20 years of personal experience in dealing with them, they have always performed better than agreed. we have never had to step in (as we’ve had to with other manufacturers) to make it right for the customer. and they even cover the labor for the installation which no one else will do.
the best prices and the most choices. the bufftech corporation provides the most colors, styles and choices of any manufacturer, the best engineering and the best quality at the lowest prices, and most importantly, they always stand behind what they sell.  that’s why we stick with them and we know you will too.





vinyl fence prices
our bottom line price per foot includes all the components needed to build your vinyl fence (rails, posts, caps, lock pin rings.) as national wholesalers, shipping direct from the factory, you get lower prices. although our prices are wholesale, we sell direct to the public. we beat all local prices, service and quality. try us and see.
to determine the price of your vinyl fence project, choose your vinyl fence style – then fill out the basic info under “get an instant quote” to get an instant, hassle free, online quote.




vinyl fence quality you can count on
all of our vinyl fences are commercial grade, heavy duty, top of the line, 100% virgin materials backed by a non-prorated factory backed lifetime warranty, manufactured by bufftech, a division of bufftech corporation, one of the oldest (100 yrs) and largest building material manufactures in the united states.
nationwide leading online bufftech wholesaler 18 years in a row
since 1998, we’ve offered wholesale pricing to the general public on bufftech products, including the full line of bufftech vinyl fence. seeking lower prices and higher quality vinyl fencing, people have turned from lowe’s and home depot’s vinyl fencing lines and have turned us into buffetech’s nationwide leading online wholesaler. our experienced, skilled and knowledgeable staff can get you all the information you need on vinyl fences, including straight forward pricing for everything you need for your vinyl fence project up to and including engineering . better quality, lower prices, complete answers from qualified people and easy ordering is why we lead our field and in many states, you can even forgo all or part of the sales tax!
