	on non-muslims dhimmis under islam. 
	her first study, les juifs en egypte (french/1971; hebrew/1974) was followed by 
	le dhimmi (paris/1980), 
	whose translation into english (1985; hebrew/1986; russian/1991) brought her international recognition.
	the dhimmi: jews and christians under islam (1985) remains an essential introduction to her second major work, 
	the decline of eastern christianity under islam. 
	from jihad to dhimmitude (french/1991; english/1996; german/2002), which put the study of this topic on a new footing that could no longer be ignored. 
	the french edition (1991) confirmed her reputation as a pioneer thinker in a new field of research. this was greatly enhanced by 
	islam and dhimmitude. where civilizations collide, which examines the trend toward dhimmitude in the 20th century.
	her latest book, eurabia: the euro-arab axis (31 january 2005), describes the 
	gradual transformation of europe into "eurabia," a cultural and political appendage of the arab/muslim world. 
	a serious assessment of the traditional "jihad ideology" -  and of dhimmitude - became all the more essential in the aftermath of the terrorist jihad-war 
	against america on september 11, 2001. 
	bat ye'or has revealed the open sesame to "eurabia," the developing continent of dhimmitude.
