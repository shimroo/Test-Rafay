world cruise--another day in paradise





day two in honolulu found us taking a taxi after breakfast to the
airport to pick up a rental car bob had reserved a couple days before. on our sea
days, i had mapped a drive around the island to see some of the points of interest
we had visited before. after our let down at the mall, i’d added a stop at a shopping
center that was north of honolulu and hoped for the best. it showed a nail
salon and a barber but no price list.
the traffic was awful going to the airport and the taxi
meter registered $50 including the tip that bob gave. it was half of the cost
of our rental car. it took us a while to get out of the traffic and headed
north on the highway. we found the shopping center without much trouble and the
salon and barber. the money we saved on the nails and haircut covered the cost
of the taxi. so far so good. 
our first tourist stop on the way to the north shore of oahu
was the dole plantation. the place was packed and we had to park in overflow
parking. we’d been here before and taken the tour so we just walked around a
bit and enjoyed the free part of it that included a little garden of pineapple
plants.
waimea falls was a place we wanted to revisit and we drove
to where the park is. to our surprise, it was closed on mondays. what? should
have done a little more research on that one.
out on the road again, we pointed the car for the north
shore beach that is the scene of all those exciting surfing contests. actually
all along the north shore it is like one long beach and even before we got to
our destination, we could see the huge waves rolling in. cars were parked along
side the road for more than a mile with surf boards being unloaded and carried
down to the shore. 
rather than park where the lot was officially for the beach,
we joined the others and pulled into a spot on the side of the road and
followed two girls who were headed for the beach. there was an alley way
between the houses that allowed access. 
the beach was amazing as were the waves rolling in and
breaking along the shore. they were so large they dwarfed the surfers and it
took a while to see that the little dots on top of the waves awaiting the right
moment were actually people on surf boards. 

we spent a little time there watching in awe and of course,
i had to put my feet in. the water was not as cold as i thought it would be and
i almost enjoyed a full body immersion when a wave ran into the shore farther
than i expected. i was up to my knees in surf and hoping to keep my balance as
the water ran back out and the sand around my feet shifted. 
it would have been nice to linger but time was ticking and
we were only half way around the island. lunch was had at a food truck stop
where the king of food trucks was giovanni. their specialty was shrimp and the
truck is covered in signatures of those who have eaten there. we split a plate
of lemon buttered shrimp and rice.
we followed the road that goes down the east side of the
island and enjoyed stunning views of ocean, beach and lush green mountains. our
next stop was to be the makapu’u point light house. i’d taken a good picture of
it from our whale watching boat and there was supposed to be a trail that led
out to it. what the information should have said was “led up to it.” we saw the
trail leading up a mountainside which i guess led around to the other side for
a view of the lighthouse. we drove on.
a quick stop at the blowhole to see that it really wasn’t
blowing much and we began to worry that our time was running out. we had to
have the car back and grab a taxi to get back to the ship by 5:30. remembering
all the traffic, we decided that we would skip going to see the snorkeling bay
at halona beach cove. as we passed by the park entrance, we saw it was closed
as well. does everyone get monday off?
that left just one place that we weren’t sure we would have
time for but it worked out to take just one really quick look at the punchbowl crater
where the national cemetery is. the graves aren’t marked with white tombstones
as they are in other national military cemeteries.
the traffic wasn’t as bad as the morning had been and we
made it to the airport with about an hour to find a taxi and get to the ship.
the problem arose in getting the taxi. the line for the taxis was already long
and there was only on or two taxis showing up at a time. there must have been a
lot of arrivals because by the time we got in line, it had almost doubled. we
waited a good twenty minutes before a bunch of taxis began showing up and
eventually we got one, a good one. he took us a different route to the ship and
it only cost $40 including tip. we arrived 45 minutes before the passenger
deadline for boarding before sail away. it did give us a little scare though. a
little more traffic and we would have been flying to samoa.

world cruise--day one in paradise





sunrises. sunsets. blue skies. warm breezes. it doesn’t get
much better than that. our two days in honolulu couldn’t have been more perfect
where the weather was concerned. we had arranged through viator for a whale watching
tour with majestic by atlantis cruises. i love the options you get by booking
through viator. not only is it usually less expensive than a ship’s excursion
but they don’t charge your credit card until 48 hours before the tour and it gives
you the option to cancel without penalty before that which allows for
flexibility if the ship’s itinerary should change or the weather looks to be
bad that day.
the whale watching boat was only an eight minute walk from
our ship. we had a leisurely breakfast and then walked to the boat and beyond
to the aloha tower. there was a marketplace there where we thought we might
grab a coffee and look in the shops. we didn’t count on it being sunday and
since the area was associated with the hawaiian pacific university, there were
no students around for classes and the shops were closed. we found one lone coffee
café open and purchased some drinks then sat down to call our at&t service
who had shut down our data usage.
long story but the crux of it was that in order to avoid
charges for cellular at sea, we had to place our phones in airplane mode on the
ship to shut down any data roaming even if data roaming was turned off which
was our usual procedure for a cruise (a hundred cruises and this was a first).
something had obviously changed either with our service or with the way
cellular at sea works. it was a costly discovery but thankfully at&t shut
it down until we figured it out. 
our data problem worked out, we wandered around a bit and
then received a message that we could board the majestic at 10:45 for our 11:30
tour. we headed to the boat, showed our voucher for our tickets and boarded a
very large three decker boat with an open deck on top. the lower decks had
inside tables, the first deck set up for kids’ activities and the second with a
bar and snack food including sandwiches. we made note of that and decided we
would have lunch a bit later.
by the time we made it out of the harbor, the sea was a
little choppier but not too bad. our naturalist told us that we would head for
diamond head as there were whales reported to be seen there. we did not expect
to see a lot here in honolulu since most of the whales made their way to maui
where there was a larger and more protected area for them to calve their
babies.
actually we told ourselves we didn’t care if we saw whales
or not. it was such a pleasant day and the views of honolulu and the mountains
behind it were lovely. i had a hallmark moment when i saw the pink hotel from
one of their movies.
suddenly fingers pointed and our naturalist directed our
attention to a spout where a whale had surfaced. we moved closer and i think
the whales moved a bit closer to us as well. we floated around for about an
hour, moving once in a while to get closer to the small pod of whales that surfaced
on occasion. several times we saw a tail flip into the air as one would dive.
there were no breaches and in all our times whale watching we have never seen
one. we were surprised however years ago when we were boating out to a dive
spot near maui and suddenly one breached straight into the air next to our
small dive boat. we all sat stunned by the suddenness and wonder of it all.
our whale watching over, we started back to the ship. there
was a shuttle that would take us to the ala moana shopping mall. a huge mall
(several football fields long/wide), we thought it was sure to have a nail
salon and a barber to meet our needs. when we started roaming the mall, i
realized there was little chance that what we would find would be anywhere near
our comfort zone in pricing. the stores were all upscale, nieman marcus,
bloomingdales, rolex, gucci, etc. sure enough the nail salon and barber shop we
found were just as expensive as the ship’s offerings. 
it wasn’t a wasted trip though. we found a cinnabon and had
two good coffees and some small bons before walking a mile to find the shuttle
stop again. the mall was really confusing and was three floors as well. we made
it though and were dropped off at the cruise terminal in time to shower and
dress for dinner and watch a glorious sunset.

world cruise--a rainy day in san francisco





pulling the drapes open, we
looked out a pouring rain and wind whipping it around. a check of the weatherbug
showed that it wasn’t going to get much better. but…the weatherbug hadn’t been
quite right the day before so we went off to breakfast hoping that perhaps
there would be enough of a break that we could finish our wish list for san
francisco.
by the time we were done with
breakfast, the weather app’s radar was showing the promise of a possible short
break. we took our insurance umbrellas, dressed for the cooler weather and
headed out to find the cable car by fisherman’s wharf to ride into the heart of
the city.
the cable cars have been in
operation for over 150 years. there was a time where they faced extinction but
thanks to the efforts of a group of dedicated people, they were saved and
continue to operate to the amazement of all who come to ride them. 
there are several loops of cable
that run through the city. the cars hook into the cable and are pulled up the streets,
some of which are very steep. a driver in front and a brake man in back, they
work in tandem to slow the car on descent and move forward up the hills. it’s
quite an operation especially when the traffic causes havoc. during one of our
rides, a car played chicken at an intersection. we stopped suddenly and the
operator laughed and said, “you can’t make this stuff up.”  (i’m sure he wanted to do and say something
more than that.)
our first cable ride took us to
within a block or two of a target store where we managed to find the rest of
the things we needed that weren’t behind lock and key like at the cvs and
walgreens. bob’s backpack full, we headed back, now in the rain, to the cable
car turnaround.  we decided to take a
short cut through bloomingdale’s with bob’s admonition that we weren’t buying
anything. too bad. everything was on sale as it was going out of business. we
did pick up a free bag for our umbrellas which worked out well since they were
drenched and dripping.
the turnarounds are platforms
that the cable car pulls up on, is disengaged and the operators get out and
manually turn the car on the turntable to head in the other direction. it’s all
done quickly. the car is loaded with passengers again and it goes on its way.
this time we got off the cable
car at the stop for the museum and the central operation. giant wheels and
gears moved the cables throughout the city. there were several older historical
cable cars on display but the main attraction is just the amazing operation of
the whole thing. the other amazing thing is that it is free admission for the
museum.
we waited in the rain at another intersection
near the museum that would take us closer to pier 39 where we wanted to stop
for lunch. the umbrellas may not have insured it wouldn’t rain but they did
protect us pretty well.
the cable car finally came. they
are usually about 20 minutes apart but this was not high tourist season so it
may have taken a bit longer. 
we reached the end of the line
and walked down to the wharf. rain was coming down pretty hard now and we
started to pass a restaurant with outdoor seating where two guys were encouraging
people to come in and eat. 
“indoor seating?” bob asked. the
guys nodded and pointed to the door.
inside was a bit like you would
expect a seaside restaurant that had been there for a long time. we would
discover later that it was a third generation operation. when business is slow
you get to talk to owners. he was fascinated with us taking such a long cruise
and was looking forward to his first soon, a much shorter one. he cheerfully
split our cup of clam chowder and the lobster roll we ordered for the two of us
to share. i couldn’t decide if it was because business was slow and he was
happy to have us or if it was our white hair and age since he’d lost his mother
not long ago but we felt well taken care of.
as we started out, bob mentioned
that we wanted to try taking a waymo, a driverless taxi, and asked where the
best place to call for one was. bob had already downloaded the app which
was  bit like the uber. the manager told
us to just stay under the over hang outside that when we ordered it, it would
pull up in front of the restaurant. 
sure enough it was about five
minutes later, a white jaguar with all the paraphernalia of the driverless car
stopped in front of us. on the top of the cab was a rotating bubble that had
bob’s initials flashing to indicate that it was our waymo. 
to get in, you had to push an
unlock button on the app and the handles popped out of the doors. we got into a
very nice clean car with several display screens, one in front (as if a driver
would use it) and one between the front seats facing us with a welcome message
and a spot to touch to start our journey when we were ready.
a nice smooth female voice told
us to sit back and enjoy the ride and instructed us that we needed to secure
our seatbelts for safety. we did that and the car proceeded forward. 
at first it was kind of a weird
sensation knowing there was no one in the driver’s seat. i watched as the steering
wheel turned to take us down another street. marveled at the stops it made for
traffic lights and stop signs and smiled as other tourists were snapping
pictures of the car, just as fascinated as we were.
the pier for our ship was only
about a ten minute ride and the car pulled up to the curb opposite it. i don’t
think they are allowed on the pier like a regular taxi. the voice told us we’d
arrived and thanked us without ever asking for a tip. bob also marveled that
the “driver” spoke english.
since our ride was short, we didn’t
get to explore some of the other features of the car like choosing our own
music or asking for help like our friends did when the car wouldn’t go down the
famous crooked street of san francisco. apparently there are some places it’s
not allowed.

while i thought i would be
fearful of the ride, once it began, i relaxed and really enjoyed it. maybe i
could get used to some new technology after all.
we decided to delay dinner so
that we could watch as we sailed out of the bay under the golden gate bridge.
our departure was delayed for almost an hour. not sure why but soon we were on
our way after the sun had set. it was way too cold and windy and rainy to go
out on the deck to take pictures although some brave souls did. my picture was
through a rainy window.
san francisco had turned out to
be a whole lot more fun than we had ever expected, even in the rain.

world cruise--a day in san francisco





the postings on the queene anne world cruise facebook page from those
in san francisco awaiting the ship’s arrival for the start of their portion of
the cruise didn’t look promising. lots of pictures of rain and one in
particular of the golden gate bridge that was barely visible from all the rain.
so, when we awoke our first morning in sf, we were pleased to see that,
although a bit dreary, the rain had let up and almost to a stop. from our balcony,
we could see coit tower on telegraph hill, a clear view of alcatraz island and
a partial view of the golden gate that we had sailed under around 4 am. (we
slept through that.)
the forecast still called for a chance of rain. we shrugged,
packed the umbrellas (for insurance that it wouldn’t rain again) and set off. 
but let me back up a bit. this was the first day of entry
for the ship back to the us so all the passengers had to go through immigration
and once through you could not reboard until the whole of the ship had been
processed. added to that, bob’s doctor suggested he change up his medication a
bit and he hadn’t brought enough to do that so we had to find a pharmacy for
the office to send the prescription. the cvs we found was not in their system
(we would discover later the store was closing) so we found a walgreen’s on the
map that was not quite a mile away and decided to try that. 
luckily, the immigration process was going well and we were
able to leave earlier than planned. the weather that was supposed to be rainy
turned out to be drier and warmer than expected. we googled our way to the
walgreen’s and the pharmacy gave us the contact information the doctor’s office
needed. when we tried to call the doctor, bob’s phone went dead and wouldn’t place
the call. after several frustrating attempts, he used mine. (later he turned
the phone off and on and backed it up and it started working again.) all set—or
so we thought.
we walked back down to the harbor and fisherman’s wharf
where we wandered around a bit and grabbed a hot tea and sweet roll to share at
a bakery and rested a bit. near the bakery was an arcade that featured “antique”
arcade games. some of them were not quite as antique as we are but it was fun
looking at them.
we had a little more time to kill before meeting our tour
guide at pier 33 for our afternoon excursion so we wandered toward pier 39. the
wharf has several piers, all numbered and easy to find. they are all relatively
close together as well. pier 39 is probably the busiest as it had a slew of
restaurants and shops and snack places and a view of the herd of very noisy sea
lions.
we needed to get lunch before our tour so we found a place
where we got some clam chowder and a tuna salad on sour dough that was not as
good as i remembered the sour dough being from our visit years ago. it was a
little disappointing. 
after lunch, on our way to pier 33, we got a facetime call
from a granddaughter who had just had her wisdom teeth removed. we talked a few
minutes and commiserated with her, complimenting her on her chipmunk cheeks
that we promised would go away. i love the technology we have today that can
help us keep in touch no matter where we are in the world.
our arrival was a few minutes early but so were all the
others who were on the tour. we filled the mercedes van which was quite
comfortable and set off for our trip over the golden gate and on to muir woods
where all the large redwoods are. still no rain but a bit of a mist now and
then. the umbrella insurance was working.
our driver took us over the golden gate and to the area set
aside for viewing. i remember being there before when we drove ourselves. it
does give you good opportunity for photos. i did not remember the sailor
monument as it was dedicated in 2002. a bronze plaque with a dedication on it
is worth repeating here:
                 the
lone sailorthis is a memorial to every one who ever sailed out of the
golden gate in the service of their country - in the navy, the marine corps,
the coast guard, the merchant marine.

a ship heading for sea passes directly by this spot at the northern end of the
golden gate. here the sailor feels the first long roll of the sea, the
beginning of the endless horizon that leads to the far pacific.

there is one last chance to look back at the city of san francisco, shining on
its hills, one last chance to look back at the coastline of the united states,
one last chance to look back at home.

thousands and thousands of american seafarers have sailed past this place, in
peace and war, to defend this country and its sea frontiers. many of them never
returned. this monument is dedicated to the ordinary sailors and marines who
sailed from this place and did their duty.

carl nolte
the rest of our drive to muir woods took us up a mountain on
winding roads and back down into a valley. the area is really beautiful and some
of the views of the bay were spectacular. it was a little cooler at the park
than it had been on the wharf and i put my quilted vest back on. i think it was
more from the dampness. it had rained eight inches over the last couple of days.
thankfully the path was part boardwalk, part paved walkway. a few places had
some muddy spots but were easily navigated without too much trouble. we had
worried that our shoes would get muddy with not good way to get them cleaned
again. (the laundry room had a sign saying “do not wash shoes in the machines.”)
just as we arrived at the park, bob got a message that he
could not get the prescription because it was too soon for a refill. this wasn’t
really a refill, it was a new prescription for extra meds. gotta love insurance.
though we had been told there would be no cell service at the park, he found he
had two bars and made a call to the pharmacy. she said she would see what she
could do and we said we’d pay for it if we had to. 
the misty feel was becoming a little wetter but still not
bad. there was a front moving in and by the time we arrived at sausalito, a
stop on our tour, you could feel the temperature dropping and the wind picking
up. we were to have an hour in the little town area that had shops and
restaurants before the tour would end back again at pier 33. we had planned to
take the ferry back to the wharf from sausalito and decided that we would leave
sooner than later. sausalito didn’t interest that much with the weather
changing. 
the ferry ride was smoother than i anticipated given the
wind picking up as it was. the ride was scenic and would have been even nicer
with a little sunshine. arriving with enough daylight left and a shorter walk
to the walgreen’s who had texted the prescription was ready (and with no cost
to us) we decided the plan for the rest of the day was the walk to the pharmacy,
followed by dinner somewhere on the wharf and then back to the ship.
it couldn’t have worked out more perfectly. we made it to
walgreens, picked up the meds, passed on buying the sundries on our list since
most of the things were under lock and key. things i would never expect people
would want or could shoplift. it would have taken forever to have someone
follow us around and unlock everything we needed.serenaded our dinner 
we found a wonderful italian restaurant on pier 39 for
dinner. bob had seafood pasta that was loaded with more seafood than i’ve ever
seen on that dish before. i had a heaping plate of ravioli with a meat sauce
that was excellent. and to top it off was a side order of tasty garlic
sourdough bread that was the real deal.
i was glad we had about a fifteen minute walk back to the
ship. it was a chance to walk off the huge meal. we both ate more than we
should have but it was so good. 
back on the ship, i gave in to my legs and knees and back
that were protesting all the walking we’d done. when i checked my phone it
showed over 10 miles for the day’s walk. i took a hot shower and plopped into
bed while bob went on to see the evening entertainment. what stamina.
this post is too long to contain the second day of fun in
san fran. so i will have to do up another. tune in for some amazing modes of
transportation in the next post.

world cruise--sea days, guatemala, cabo





so far our days at sea have been very good. there are
usually two between ports, just enough to relax before a busy day. there will
be longer stretches soon but they seem to be filled with plenty of activity.
the speakers have been very interesting especially george kourounis who is quite
an explorer and has done a lot for national geographic and angry planet among
other shows i’m not familiar with. look him up on youtube. he is amazing.
evenings have been filled with some great entertainers and a
couple of the captain’s cocktail parties, one for the world club (those who
have sailed cunard before) and another for the 1,043 world cruisers aboard. the
world cruise party featured all sorts of hors d’oeuvres including caviar and a
cake that they never cut. we suspect it might have been fake and just for show.
puerto quetzal in guatemala was a nice warm up. not quite as
hot as cartegena had been and we spent a good part of our day on an air-conditioned
bus. our excursion took us to a drive through safari zoo. it was a little more
than an hour from the ship but it gave us an opportunity to see the countryside
and the volcanoes in the distance. guatemala has over 30 volcanoes several of
which can activate at any time and some were smoking a bit. 
the zoo was nicely planned out with fenced in zones for the
different animals. once a vehicle passed through a gate, an attendant would
close it again. that explained why the lion and tiger didn’t meander into the
antelope area for dinner not to mention the fact that they would be fed raw
beef regularly and probably weren’t hungry. curiously the male lion and female tiger
were together in the compound. they seemed to get along quite well and it
appeared the male lion was a bit amorous. what was up with that? a new species?

the safari zoo reminded me of one back home but at this one,
you didn’t feed the animals. there was quite a variety of mostly animals from
africa in the drive through part of the park. after a soft drink and serving of
french fries (excellent fries, probably cooked in the tasty kind of oil), we
walked through a smaller area that housed animals and birds native to
guatemala. 
it was a nice getaway from the ship for a few hours. the
only regret is that we had to view all the animals in the drive through park from
the bus and it was difficult to get good pictures. when we stopped to get a
close up view of the giraffes and were offered the opportunity to feed them, i
got a great picture of the younger one. i tried to get a photo of the capuchin
monkeys that were caged nearby (they were called capuchino here, pronounced
like the coffee drink). now i’ve had some experience with capuchins in costa rico
and i know they can be quick and mischievous, but i felt confident in putting
my camera close enough to the enclosure to get the picture between the wired
sides. it was even double wired halfway up to keep them from reaching out. it
didn’t work. that little stinker stuck his arm through a hole and grabbed at my
camera before i knew what was happening. luckily he didn’t get hold of it and i
didn’t drop it. it did startle me pretty good. i’m sure he had a good chuckle over
it.
and before i forget, our tour guide began by introducing
herself as karen, the good karen. i later told her i was the other good karen
on the bus. she laughed. as a matter of fact she laughed a lot through out the
whole excursion. 
after two days at sea, our next port was cabo san lucas. we’ve
been there before and done whale watching and seen the manta rays jump out of
the water so we passed on the water excursions. i remembered cabo as being a
nice place to walk where there were a lot of nice hotels and shops. it has
changed, greatly. there are a lot more bars and the hawkers have multiplied
exponentially to great degree.greeting the guest from the tenders 
before i get ahead of myself let me say there were nearly
3000 people to get off the ship by tender since there was not a pier at cabo
for cruise ships. people on excursions get first priority of course and we
figured that by mid morning the rush would be close to over so we played a
little pickleball before we had to go to the royal theater to pickup a tender
ticket (the method for organizing the operation).  as we entered by the long passageway to the
bottom of the theater, a staff member was there by a mat that had two white
stripes on it with the picture of a shark between the lines. we were asked to
step over the lines as a way to see if we were mobile enough to bridge the
small gap between ship and tender. clever way to eliminate some who claimed to
be mobile but perhaps weren’t as much as they thought.
 the royal theater had
to be filled with about 700 or more people. we sat and waited, knowing the last
of the excursions had left and thinking it wouldn’t be too long. we were wrong.
it was an hour and a half wait.
as eleven o’clock passed, our plans were now changed to
include lunch as there was no way we were going to make it off and back on for
lunch. the tenders took 50-60 people at a time. ship’s tenders as well as local
tender boats were being used. when it came our turn, we realized why the long
wait. the sea was a bit rough and the tenders were having trouble bouncing up
and down and keeping the little ramp in place for passengers to board. we’ve
been on more challenging tender trips but this certainly slowed progress. it
was all good. by the time our number had been called we had mapped out our
shopping excursion.
cabo has a marina area with a boardwalk around it that made
for a pleasant walk in temperatures that were in the 70s and nice sunshine with
a little breeze. we followed the little blue dotted line on my google maps app,
dodged hawkers and their goods, declined numerous offers for boat rides and
fishing and finally made it around the busiest area of the boardwalk. a little
farther and we turned off on a street and followed it around to find our
destination. walmart.
there was a need to get a few things like wire hangers that
take up less space in the closets, a storage box that bob wanted for his underwear
to keep in the bathroom (tmi?), body wash for me (i don’t care for the smell of
the ship’s), cups with lids to carry coffee from the buffet, and air freshener
(there is a funky smell in the shower that doesn’t seem to go away). while
hangers and storage boxes were easy, body wash and air freshener was a bit of a
challenge since everything was in spanish. i spent a good deal of time
translating with my phone before i actually found a body wash that was in english.

all in all, it was a good experience. even trying to explain
to a walmart employee eager to help but didn’t speak english that we wanted bar
soap to wash with. thankfully there was an english icon on the self checkout
and a helpful attendant to make sure we did it all right. we had to buy a bag
to carry our goods back but that will come in handy as a nice big laundry bag.
all in all, prices were good.
bob had a taste for something from home, macdonald’s. just
around the corner from walmart we were able to satisfy his craving. the menu
was partly in english and the counter help spoke it well. we enjoyed our “mexican
macdonald’s,” two big boys, a medium fry and two cokes for $13, and made our
way back to the main dock where the tenders were picking up guests to return to
the ship. our wait was much shorter this time and the seas had calmed a good
deal. curious though, as we waited we saw foodstuffs that were being loaded on
a tender for the ship. croissants and other bakery in containers as well as
some other produce. even after questioning a few waiters onboard, we were
assured that all the morning bakery was made on the ship. hmmmm.
we did not get to visit the famous arch at cabo but did
catch a glimpse of it as our ship passed. unfortunately the sun was shining
directly into the camera and i couldn’t get a good picture. 
bob attended the sabbath service in the evening before
dinner. he did that on our other world cruise and enjoyed learning more about
the jewish service. they haven’t thrown the gentile out yet.

world cruise--cartegena and through the canal





 cartagena, colombia, is a place we have visited almost half
a dozen times. on the previous visit, we discovered that there was an aviary
right at the port that we could walk through and enjoy the collection of birds
they have. since we have done the old city several times and have no desire to
go into the main city, we opted to explore the aviary again.
we were a little concerned when we heard that there was now
a charge and someone mentioned $70. while it’s beautiful, we didn’t want to
spend that kind of money for it. as it often turns out, you need to search out
the facts for yourself and when we arrived at the port we planned to do just
that.
this morning was the first one where the ship felt stable
enough to safely play some pickleball but the temperature had climbed to the
mid 80s with the humidity rising as well. half the pickleball court was shaded
and there was only the two of us so we stayed in the shade and just smacked the
ball back and forth for a while. it was still a pretty good workout but we only
lasted about 45 minutes.
after stowing our paddles in our stateroom, we grabbed our
water bottles and hats and headed out for the aviary. did i mention there were
a total of four large ships in port? the walk to the aviary is not far and
there was a gentle breeze blowing which helped with the heat. we arrived to
find that it was still free albeit wanting some donations since the aviary is a
shelter for injured birds, or so they say. 
the crowd was quite large but once we got past the place
where many had stopped to get a tropical drink or get into the gift shop, it
wasn’t quite so bad. they have added a monkey who was being held by one lady
tourist as we entered one section. he seemed quite content until it took too
long to get the picture i guess and he bit her. a little later we would see a
sloth that the attendant was draping over willing tourists. no thanks. at least
the sloth didn’t look dangerous and i think by the time he would have opened
his mouth to bite, you would have seen what might be coming and avoided it.
our time in cartegena was a bit short. we had to be back on
board at one and were supposed to be on our way shortly after. for some reason
we didn’t leave until 2 but we would still make it in time for our scheduled
passage through the panama canal.
we awoke the next morning early to be up in time to watch
the beginning of our trip through the new locks of panama. this would be our
fifth trip through the canal but the first through the new locks. queen anne is
much too large to pass through the old locks. as a matter of fact, the
promenade deck was closed for the day. sometime late evening or through the
night, the crew had lowered the railings around the deck and moved the
lifeboats in a bit. they overhang the side of the ship by about twelve inches
or so and to prevent scraping against the sides of the locks, they were pulled
in a lirrle as were some lights that also extend out past the side of the ship.
as we neared the first lock at the agua clara locks,
tugboats met us. these are special tugs (if i heard correctly, they came from
spain) that are high powered for maneuvering the large ships to keep them
centered in the lock. some guide ropes appeared to be used as well as we could
see attendants on shore tossing ropes over to the ship. 
the ship uses its own power to move from lock to lock once
the water level is reached and the gates opened. there were three levels going
into lake gatun and three levels at the pacific side when we exited. it took
much longer (about 2 ½ to 3 hours at each end) than i remember taking when we
went through the old locks. not quite as much fun for me. the “mules” that are
used at the old locks are more interesting to watch and there are two locks
side by side so you can also watch another ship going up or down in the lock. 
i’m not going to go into all the explanation of how the new
locks work. i posted that after our last trip when we did an excursion to see
them when they were first finished. if you are interested in a bit more
information click on my link here to the earlier post.
bridge of americasonce through the locks, it is about a five hour cruise
through lake gatun and “the big ditch” to get to the cocoli locks on the
pacific side. the weather was beautiful and it was so peaceful and restful to
sit on the balcony and enjoy the fresh air and lush  green scenery. once we reached the cocoli locks, the sun was beginning its late afternoon descent and as we exited to pass under the bridge of the americas, we could see the skyline of panama city. always impressive and even more so as the sun was beginning to set. the multi colored structure is a museum. i think that's new since our last visit. i don't remember it. by the way, for those who are as curious as my husband, the cost for the ship to go through the canal was $415,000. bob is still wondering if they paid cash or use a credit card.
i haven’t said much about life on the ship but we are
enjoying wonderful meals, have gotten to know tablemates to one side from britain
and the other side from scotland. have shared some hilarious stories. two gala
nights (one red/gold themed and another just formal). bob is happy to get more
use out of his tux. lectures have been very interesting and i’ll post more
about that next time. for now, it’s on to puerto quetzal, guatemala.

world cruise--new york city to miami





 always as a safety measure, we fly into our embarkation port
at least a day early and especially during the winter months so we arrived with
our five bags of luggage and two carry-ons (plus bob’s backpack) on friday afternoon.
when we booked our world cruise on the queen anne, we thought we would have to
start in hamburg, germany, as that was the origin of the world cruise. it would
have required a long plane flight plus a night or two in hamburg. then we found
that there was an option of starting instead in either southampton or new york
and still be able to have all the benefits that come with doing the complete
world cruise. as we americans say, it was a no-brainer.
the flight to new york had a tail wind so we arrived a bit
earlier than expected. at cle we had been dropped off in front of the outside
baggage check so we didn’t have to schlep bags through the airport. in new
york, we opted to get a wheeled cart to help with the luggage. bob was shocked
to find the price was $6 to use one. we remember when it was only twenty-five
cents or half a dollar and you could return it to get your money back. but,
this was nyc or rather newark, nj.
our luggage was quickly retrieved and we headed for the taxi
stand. the attendant entered our destination, printed a ticket, handed it to
bob and pointed to an suv (five bags of luggage). the driver loaded it up and
drove a little ways from the departure stand to be sure we understood what the
cost was to get to brooklyn and our hotel. it was then bob looked at the paper
the attendant had handed us and saw the $90 plus the $43 dollars in tolls. he
shook his head. “well, guess it’s our only choice.” we drove on.
the drive was about 45 minutes through some traffic that
obviously wasn’t being reduced all that much by the recent increase in tolls. outside
the door of the hampton inn, the driver began to unload our suitcases while bob
ducked inside to get a luggage cart. before we could begin stacking the luggage
on it, a gentleman from the hotel was there and loaded it all for us. i’m not
sure what his position was in the hotel but he turned out to be extremely
helpful and especially with luggage.
craig (we learned his name later) took the cart up to the
room while we checked in and got a regular key. bob always likes to use the key
on the app but they said it didn’t always work properly. by the time we were up
to the room, craig had almost all of it unloaded. he apologized for the room
being so small and we laughed. “it’s going to be a lot smaller than this on the
ship,” we told him. he offered to put some of the bags in storage but we
assured him we could manage for one night.
the suggestion craig gave us for our late lunch was perfect.
it was about a four block walk to juniors restaurant, in the cold i might add,
but was well worth it. the onion soup and the matzo ball soup were delicious as
well as the pastrami and corn beef sandwiches. the “famous” cheesecake was too
tempting to pass up so we got a piece to go and took it back with us.got to see the new pickleball courts inkey largo 
on our way back to the hotel, we found a target in an indoor
mall and i purchased a pair of sunglasses and endured the teasing of “you
always forget your sunglasses.”
our evening and the next morning were spent indoors. while
it wasn’t quite as freezing as back home it was still cold. when it was time to
go to the ship, we again had lots of help from craig and a great uber driver
(the price wasn’t a sticker shock). luggage was handled at the drop off for the
ship much to the uber driver’s surprise and i assume relief. we were ready to
board and begin our three and a half month journey.
the queen anne is large. we haven’t been on a ship quite
this size in a while. just for instance—most times we have to walk 4-6 times
around the promenade deck to get a mile walk in. this ship was only 2.5 laps. lunch
was had in the golden lion although we passed on fish and chips, the specialty,
and settled for sausages with gravy and potatoes. thankfully not a big helping.
we then began our exploration of the ship as we usually do our first day. it
would not be completed before dinner. there was just too much to see and the
parts that were outside we skipped. we had a bigger chore awaiting us—unpacking.
while the qa is large, the storage space in the rooms is
not. i had planned ahead and brought several plastic baskets that we could
store some things in on the top shelf above the desk area. we organized closets
with “gala” clothes (the formal nights) and regular clothes and managed to get
most everything in a place hoping to remember each place later. bags were a bit
tricky to store under the bed but eventually we worked it out with our room
steward and he removed some of the storage units he used under the bed so ours
would fit. we can slid two open suitcases out like an extra drawer.
meals have been wonderful. we have an assigned table for two
between two others that have some lovely couples we’ve grown fond of from
scotland and the uk. lectures have been interesting. weather finally warmed up
as we neared miami and the sun came out!
our personal excursion in miami was to rent a car and drive
to key largo to meet some friends for lunch. bob wanted to try out a tesla. so,
of course it was to be an adventure starting with the fact that the returned
tesla had not been cleaned yet and only had a 60% charge on it with no place to
charge it at the rental place. we took it anyway and knew of a place in key
largo where we could charge it. when it came time though, we discovered that
the car did not have the adaptor needed to fit the charging station. we went on
and met our friends, had a great time catching up and eating at one of our
favorite places in key largo and then started back north to the tesla charging
station on the map that was 24 miles away. by the time we got there we were at
6% battery power. 
there were a few other problems with the car along the way.
to begin, just trying to figure out how to get the doors open. we never did figure
out the passenger side. bob had to stretch across to open my door. we called
his brother who had a tesla and asked how to set the cruise control. all in all
it was quite an experience and we decided against a tesla in our future.
from miami, our next port is cartegena in two days. the sun
is shining. it’s getting warmer and we have finally finished our tour of the
ship—well most of it. i suspect there are places we still haven’t discovered.
