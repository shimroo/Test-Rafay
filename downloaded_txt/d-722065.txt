our 2024 / 2025 season

 

dear sfago members,on behalf of the new board, i would like to welcome you to the 2024-2025 sfago program year!it was a pleasure to see many of you at the national convention this summer and to speak to you about your experiences with the ago and your desires for the future of the chapter. this feedback was very helpful in planning the programs for this year.the fall highlights are an opening social event, the keynote recital featuring bay area native ncoi winner ethan haman on the new organ at st ignatius, and the christmas party featuring a silent film with theater-style accompaniment. all of these events are free admission for both sfago members and guests, and we encourage everyone to invite/bring friends, family, parishioners, colleagues, or anyone else who may be interested.over the upcoming weeks, you will receive several communications regarding the strategic planning process currently being undertaken by the board and supported by ago national. the current board is committed to making substantial improvements in chapter operations with the ultimate goal of implementing more efficient and transparent operating procedures, increasing membership value, and increasing chapter visibility in the bay in line with our mission statement.cheers to a wonderful season,best,daniel gonzalez, deanliz forsyth, subdean electeric zhang, member-at-largejim warren, treasurer
