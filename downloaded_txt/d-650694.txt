welcome to the chinese human rights web, a site devoted to informed discussion of both historical and contemporary human rights issues, particuarly as they pertain to china. the site is maintained by stephen c. angle and marina svensson, the coeditors of the chinese human rights reader: documents and commentary, 1900-2000 (armonk, ny: m.e. sharpe, 2001).
