description

be in touch, be a part of, be involved with one of connecticut's oldest running clubs. motivation, group runs, training, races…meet great people along the way! we also regularly field usa track & field grand prix teams, as well as teams at other events.  all year long the club is organizing runs and races - volunteer to help and for no extra charge learn what's involved. you too can grow up to be a race director.
we have people who run 5-minute miles and people who run 15-minute miles. many of us run 5k's, many run marathons, and many do not race. all abilities are welcome – just bring an interest in running.
