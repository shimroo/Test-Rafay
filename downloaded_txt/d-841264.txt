a mango in the dark 

jacqueline mcgrath is a freelance journalist who has retinitis pigmentosa. mcgrath reviewed the parisian restaurant dans le noir?' - yet another place where diners can eat in total darkness. i sometimes find it difficult to manage a knife and fork in the dark, but i can't imagine making this mistake:?that is watermelon, isn?t it?? i asked the young man. ?absolutely,? he replied. (a glance at the bar?s chalkboard menu on my way out told me it was mango.) the meat on our plate was equally enigmatic. i sniffed the morsel on my fork ?chicken?? i asked. ?most likely duck,? the young man volunteered. (the chalkboard menu convinced me it was guinea hen.)'dining in the dark: traveler's check: dans le noir?' (kansas city star, 5 november 2006).

retinal transplants in mice 

researchers from moorfields eye hospital in london and the university of michigan medical school have successfully transplanted retinal cells in mice with genetic forms of retinal degeneration. the researchers hope that this could lead to a treatment for retinal degeneration in humans within the next decade. instead of using stem cells, the researchers are investigating the use of cells taken from the retina and that can be grown and then transplanted.scientists have recently found cells on the margin of the retina in humans that have stem-cell like properties and could potentially be grown in the lab to become photoreceptor precursor cells for treatment."rather than focusing on stem cells we believed that if we could understand how cells develop and become photoreceptors ... our transplantation efforts would meet with greater success," says professor anand swaroop, of the university of michigan medical school and a co-author of the study.'blind mice see again after transplant' (reuters at abc online, 9 november 2006.the research is published, in letters to the editor, in the november 9 2006 issue of nature

german implant research 

german researchers are continuing work on a retinal implant, according to english-language site deutsche welle:... researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa. the prosthetic consists of two parts: a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye.a tiny video camera is built into the glasses, along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand. the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens. the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable. these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve.'retinal implants are ray of hope for the blind' 30 july 2006.the article says that the implants are being tested on animals and gives information about other research into retinal implants.
