new & upcoming
















old school


from the new york times bestselling author of the unteachables comes a hilarious story about a boy who is homeschooled in his grandmother's retirement community...until he is forced to go to public school.dexter foreman is twelve going on eighty. he has lived at the pines retirement village with his grandmother since he was six years old, and as a result he gets along better with senior citizens than kids his own age. he's homeschooled by the residents up until the day the county's truancy officer shows up and announces that dex has to go to a "real" school, to the local middle school.at school, dex sticks out like a sore thumb. he dresses like a grandpa (and can be just as cranky). his taste in movies and music is decades out of date. only a few students--like gianna greco, a reporter at the school's newspaper--find him intriguing. for most, he is either a weirdo or a target.dexter would do anything to return to his old life at the pines. but when his wish finally seems to be coming true, his old and new worlds collide in a way that surprises everyone--dexter most of all.











the house of broken bricks


every marriage has its seasons...it’s autumn when we meet tess, but her relationship with richard is in a deep, cold winter. a winter so harsh, their union may never see the bright light of spring.

tess is a londoner whose relationship with richard transports her from a jamaican diaspora in the city to the english countryside, where predatory birds hover over fields, buses run twice a day, neighbors barter honey for cider, and no one looks like her.

as tess and richard settle in, the dramatic arrival of their fraternal twins—one who presents as black and the other as white—recasts the family dynamic, stirring up complicated feelings and questions of belonging. tess yearns for the comforting chaos of life as it once was, instead of max and sonny tracking dirt through the kitchen where cooking caribbean food becomes her sole comfort. and richard obsesses over getting his crops planted rather than deal with the conversation he cannot bear to have.

in fiona williams' quartet of unforgettable, alternating perspectives, secrets and vines clamber over the house’s broken red bricks, and although its inhabitants seem to be withering, sonny knows that something is stirring. . . . as the seasons change and the cracks let in more light, the family might just be able to start to heal.











happy medium

"the perfect alchemy of romance, humor and quirky originality."—sophie cousens, new york times bestselling author of this time next year and the good part

a clever con woman must convince a skeptical, sexy farmer of his property's resident real-life ghost if she's to save them all from a fate worse than death, in this delightful new novel from the author of mrs. nash's ashes.

fake spirit medium gretchen acorn is happy to help when her best (read: wealthiest) client hires her to investigate the unexplained phenomena preventing the sale of her bridge partner’s struggling goat farm. gretchen may be a fraud, but she'd like to think she’s a beneficent one. so if "cleansing" the property will help a nice old man finally retire and put some much-needed cash in her pockets at the same time, who's she to say no?

of course, it turns out said bridge partner isn't the kindly aarp member gretchen imagined—charlie waybill is young, hot as hell, and extremely unconvinced that gretchen can communicate with the dead. (which, fair.) except, to her surprise, gretchen finds herself face-to-face with everett: the very real, very chatty ghost that’s been wreaking havoc during every open house. and he wants her to help ensure charlie avoids the same family curse that's had everett haunting gilded creek since the 1920s.

now, gretchen has one month to convince charlie he can’t sell the property. unfortunately, hard work and honesty seem to be the way to win over the stubborn farmer—not exactly gretchen's strengths. but trust isn’t the only thing growing between them, and the risk of losing charlie to the spirit realm looms over gretchen almost as annoyingly as everett himself. to save the goat farm, its friendly phantom, and the man she's beginning to love, gretchen will need to pull off the greatest con of her life: being fully, genuinely herself.

"a sincere and sincerely funny romance."—alix e. harrow, new york times bestselling author of starling house

“sarah adler nails the ultimate rom-com alchemy.”—carley fortune, new york times bestselling author of every summer after and meet me at the lake











funny story


an instant #1 new york times bestseller!

named a most anticipated book of 2024 by time ∙ the new york times ∙ goodreads ∙ entertainment weekly ∙ today.com ∙ paste ∙ shereads ∙ bookpage ∙ woman's world ∙ the nerd daily and more!

a shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common, from #1 new york times bestselling author emily henry.

daphne always loved the way her fiancé peter told their story. how they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. he really was good at telling it…right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend petra.
 
which is how daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful waning bay, michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: petra’s ex, miles nowak.
 
scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned up daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either fbi or in witness protection. the roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. if said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?
 
but it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex…right?











finding margaret fuller


a “sweeping” (entertainment weekly) novel of america’s forgotten leading lady, the central figure of a movement that defined a nation—from the new york times bestselling author of the magnificent lives of marjorie post

“whether exploring margaret’s remarkable friendships or delving into her crucial legacy as a journalist, writer, and feminist, finding margaret fuller promises to transform every reader it touches.”—marie benedict, co-author of the personal librarian

young, brazen, beautiful, and unapologetically brilliant, margaret fuller accepts an invitation from ralph waldo emerson, the celebrated sage of concord, to meet his coterie of enlightened friends. there she becomes “the radiant genius and fiery heart” of the transcendentalists, a role model to a young louisa may alcott, an inspiration for nathaniel hawthorne’s hester prynne and the scandalous scarlet letter, a friend to henry david thoreau as he ventures out to walden pond . . . and a muse to emerson. but margaret craves more than poetry and interpersonal drama, and her restless soul needs new challenges and adventures.

and so she charts a singular course against a backdrop of dizzying historical drama: from boston, where she hosts a salon for students like elizabeth cady stanton; to the editorial meetings of the dial magazine, where she hones her pen as its co-founder; to harvard’s library, where she is the first woman permitted entry; to the gritty new york streets where she spars with edgar allan poe and reports on frederick douglass. margaret defies conventions time and again as an activist for women and an advocate for humanity, earning admirers and critics alike.

when the legendary editor horace greeley offers her an assignment in europe, margaret again makes history as the first female foreign news correspondent, mingling with luminaries like frédéric chopin, william wordsworth, george sand and more. but it is in rome that she finds a world of passion, romance, and revolution, taking a roman count as a lover—and sparking an international scandal. evolving yet again into the roles of mother and countess, margaret enters the fight for italy’s unification.

with a star-studded cast and sweeping, epic historical events, this is a story of an inspiring trailblazer, a woman who loved big and lived even bigger—a fierce adventurer who transcended the rigid roles ascribed to women and changed history, all on her own terms.











extinction


with extinction, #1 new york times bestselling author douglas preston has written a page-turning thriller in the michael crichton mode that explores the possible and unintended dangers of the very real efforts to resurrect the woolly mammoth and other long-extinct animals.

erebus resort, occupying a magnificent, hundred-thousand acre valley deep in the colorado rockies, offers guests the experience of viewing woolly mammoths, irish elk, and giant ground sloths in their native habitat, brought back from extinction through the magic of genetic manipulation. when a billionaire's son and his new wife are kidnapped and murdered in the erebus back country by what is assumed to be a gang of eco-terrorists, colorado bureau of investigation agent frances cash partners with county sheriff james colcord to track down the perpetrators.

as killings mount and the valley is evacuated, cash and colcord must confront an ancient, intelligent, and malevolent presence at erebus, bent not on resurrection—but extinction.











the evolution of annabel craig


a young southern woman sets out on a journey of self-discovery as the infamous 1925 scopes trial tests her faith and her marriage in this moving novel from the author of time after time and the irresistible henry house.

“lisa grunwald is a national treasure. . . . an essential american story from a master craftsman.”—adriana trigiani, new york times bestselling author of the good left undone

i had never questioned a miracle, witnessed a gunfight, or seen a dead body. . . . i had thought i knew exactly what i wanted and what i didn't. before the summer was over, all that and much more would change.
 
annabel hayes—born, baptized, and orphaned in the sleepy conservative town of dayton, tennessee—is thrilled to find herself falling quickly and deeply in love with george craig, a sophisticated attorney newly arrived from knoxville. but before the end of their first year of marriage, their lives are beset by losses. the strain on their relationship is only intensified when john t. scopes is arrested for teaching charles darwin’s theory of evolution at the local high school.

foreshadowing today’s culture wars, the trial against scopes is a spectacle unlike any the country has seen. william jennings bryan—a revered southern politician—joins the prosecution, pitting himself and his faith against the renowned defense attorney clarence darrow. journalists descend in a frenzy, thrusting the town and its citizens into the national spotlight. and when george joins the team defending scopes, annabel begins to question both her beliefs and her vows.

as the ongoing trial divides neighbor against neighbor, it also divides the craigs in unexpected ways. but in the midst of these conflicts—one waged in an open courtroom, the other behind closed doors—annabel will discover that the path to her own evolution begins with the courage to think for herself.











darling girls


"get ready for another twisty domestic thriller from the new york times bestselling author of the soulmate. from the outside, alicia, jessica and norah might seem like ordinary women you'd meet on the street any day of the week. sure, jessica has a little ocd and norah has some anger issues. and alicia has low self-esteem that manifests itself in surprising ways. but these three have a bond that no one can fully understand. it's a bond that takes them back decades, to when they were girls, and they lived on a farm with a foster mother named miss fairchild. miss fairchild had rules. miss fairchild could be unpredictable. and miss fairchild was never, ever to be crossed. in a moment of desperation, the three broke away from miss fairchild, and they thought they were free. but the reach of someone with such power is long, and even though they never saw her again, she was always somewhere in the shadows of their minds. when bones are discovered buried under the farmhouse of their childhood, they are called in by the police to tell what they know. against their will, they are brought back to the past, and to miss fairchild herself. darling girls asks the questions: what are we capable of when in a desperate place? how much can we hide the demons inside us? and can the past ever truly be buried?"--











crow talk


nationally bestselling author of the music of bees eileen garvin returns with a moving story of hope, healing, and unexpected friendship set amidst the wild natural beauty of the pacific northwest.

frankie o’neill and anne ryan would seem to have nothing in common. frankie is a lonely ornithologist struggling to salvage her dissertation on the spotted owl following a rift with her advisor. anne is an irish musician far from home and family, raising her five-year-old son, aiden, who refuses to speak.

at beauty bay, a community of summer homes nestled on the shores of june lake, in the remote foothills of mount adams, it’s off-season with most houses shuttered for the fall. but frankie, adrift, returns to the rundown caretaker’s cottage that has been in the hardworking o'neill family for generations—a beloved place and a constant reminder of the family she has lost. and anne, in the wake of a tragedy that has disrupted her career and silenced her music, has fled to the neighboring house, a showy summer home owned by her husband's wealthy family.

when frankie finds an injured baby crow in the forest, little does she realize that the charming bird will bring all three lost souls—frankie, anne, and aiden—together on a journey toward hope, healing, and rediscovering joy. crow talk is an achingly beautiful story of love, grief, friendship, and the healing power of nature in the darkest of times.











christa comes out of her shell


just when she thought she’d gotten far enough away . . . a life-changing phone call throws an antisocial scientist back into her least favorite place—the spotlight. a hilarious and insightful new novel from the usa today bestselling author of the bookish life of nina hill.

after a tumultuous childhood, christa barnet has hidden away, both figuratively and literally. happily studying sea snails in the middle of the indian ocean, christa finds her tranquil existence thrown into chaos when her once-famous father—long thought dead after a plane crash—turns out to be alive, well, and ready to make amends. the world goes wild, fascinated by this real-life saga, pinning christa and her family under the spotlight. as if that weren’t enough, her reunion with an old childhood friend reveals an intense physical attraction neither was expecting and both want to act on . . . if they can just keep a lid on it. when her father’s story starts to develop cracks, christa fears she will lose herself, her potential relationship, and—most importantly—any chance of making it back to her snails before they forget her completely.
