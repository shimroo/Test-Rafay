collab 2024
here, teens will build a community that supports their visions, encourages them to share their talents and experiences, and creates space for them to teach each other skills they can use now and over the course of their lives.
as a participant at the collab, you will:

form lasting relationships: meet other jewish teens from around north america, make new, exciting connections, and get to know people you’ve crossed paths with before even better.
make our movement stronger: find your place throughout the reform jewish youth movement in nfty, camps, social justice work, & fellowships. leadership comes in all forms, and whichever form interests you, you have a home here.
explore what makes you jewish: everyone expresses their judaism uniquely, whether it be with nature, art, deep conversation, music, or something else. discover yourself and your jewish identity with other jewish teens.
explore torah: find your way of jewish spiritual practice, while you shape the best version of your well-rounded, jewish spiritual self.
