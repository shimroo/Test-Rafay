testimonials


















 cindy zebryk 


coldwell banker – reehl properties 







“being a member of the escc has expanded my network of business owners and local contacts that has directly benefitted my business as a local realtor. so many of these contacts become friends which is an added benefit!” 























 josh hembree 


hembree heating & air 







“no brainer. it is the easiest check i write every year. it all goes back to the relationships because there’s no other form of marketing i can do to invest back into the community and have the community invest back into me.” 























 lisa dutton

“meeting lots of new friends while building my business is a win-win. i am grateful for such an amazing opportunity!”
