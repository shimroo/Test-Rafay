free floating mower deck

this exclusive simplicity mower deck features infinite height-of-cut control, freedom to float up or down at the rear and to pivot with front axle, following the contours of your lawn, for a precise cut. unlock the secret to lawn striping.









suspension comfort system

compared to traditional mowers without suspension, the simplicity suspension system offers a truly premium mowing experience with 25% less impact felt by the operator**.










automatic controlled traction

don’t get stuck because of a slippery wheel on your tractor. with simplicity tractors, automatic controlled traction will supply extra power to both rear tires when one tire starts to slip.










automotive-inspired controls

simplicity's intuitive dash system, which includes push button starting, fuel gauge, tachometer with a "best cut" range indicator and maintenance reminders, will have you feeling more like you're driving a car than mowing your lawn.
