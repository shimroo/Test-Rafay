          stacey r., ocala, fl 









"we have worked with michelle prior to selling this home. her research and pricing ability is amazing. we had a contract within 2 days and it sold at 95% of asking price. i highly recommend michelle and century 21 affiliates."
          the wall family 









"steven harrison did an excellent job with the sale of our property. he was very friendly and easy to work with."
          judi, silver springs,fl 









"michael was recommended by our broker. michael did everything for us. he was so helpful. we were 200 miles away, so it was so important that michael was able to handle everything. he was right there for the inspection and the walk through. by the time we got done with everything michael was like one of the family."
          john, dunnellon, fl 









"alyson went above and beyond !!! perfect in every way ! hard worker, always there to answer a question. she worked around our schedule. while as business owners we had several personal relationships with other agents, we definitely made the right decision choosing alyson."
          jody & stacie p., ocala, fl 









"joann's knowledge of negotiations allowed us to initiate the correct offer for the property. due to this advice we were able to out bid another buyer by $200 which was enough to culminate the deal. overall just a really decent person who never lost interest in what was best for us. from start to finish the experience with joann was both professional and accommodating. i would never hesitate to recommend joann to any of my friends, acquaintances, or other interested parties for their real estate requisites."
          davison h., ocala, fl 









"raven is one of the most dedicated and professional people with whom i have had the pleasure of working. she is immediately responsive to my needs both as a buyer and a seller. she goes above and beyond her responsibilities as an agent! i will never use anyone but raven on any future real estate transactions. this property has a renter in place and raven worked professionally with her during this process, as well. she kept me informed prior to and immediately following each showing of the house. she even helped remove carpet from the laundry room after the washing machine overflowed! sheâs nothing short of amazing!! her dedication is a rare find! a true treasure! ravenâs communication is immediate and professional. she kept me informed through phone calls, text messages and emails. i felt like i was her only client and selling my property was the most important to her."
          denee h., summerfield, fl 









"omar sold my land! he was responsible and efficient . he answered ever question and called within hours of my calling. this was a very small sale, he did not diminish his service to me because of the small commission he received. that says a lot about omar's character and professional standard. we need more real estate agents like omar in the business."
          martha v. 









"owen was very attentive to our needs and provided us with excellent service."
          neal h. 








century 21 affiliates was great to work with. once we started looking for houses century 21 affiliates was very helpful when it came to potential issues with houses. since we were using a va loan the requirements were stricter. it took a few months and multiple contracts but we were able to move into our new house and so far everything is great. would recommend century 21 affiliates to anyone looking to buy a house."
          josh r. 









"mark was made himself available and made us feel as if we were his only client. he helped reduce the stress of buying a home by displaying his knowledge and skills when helping us determine the correct price for the offer and throughout the negotiations. i don't think we could've had this great of an experience with anyone else and therefore will definitely be referring him and using him whenever we need real estate services."
          tony & camila c., ocala fl 









"michelle was excellent in dealing with this sale, i was out of the country for the whole process so michelle was my eyes and ears on location. the communications were excellent and timely, i would not have managed to sell my property had it not been for michelle."
          tom h., dundee, scotland 









"after i found a company to help me, i met michael. he is punctual, willing, pleasant, helpful and i felt good working with him. i have already recommended him to a friend."
          elin, melrose, fl 









"if you are looking in central florida for property, or selling property, give allyson a call, i truly believe you won't find a more down to earth agent to deal with, she gives her 110% and then some. this hopefully is my forever home, but if i ever need to list it, allyson will be the first person i call."
          michael b., anthony fl 









"if you are buying a house in the ocala, marion, citrus or levy counties use raven dorminey. she will not disappoint. i had a few issues come up during my purchase and she was a regular johnny on the spot. she responded to calls within minutes and helped smooth the way to closing. a wonderful person so full of enthusiasm to help you purchase the home that is right for you. i would recommend her to family and friends as well as century 21. top notch!"
          tim b., ocala, fl

          shelley & mary clark-holiday, fl (buyer)
