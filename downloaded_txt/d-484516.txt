welcome to dx radio

dx radio is the hobby of listening to distant radio stations, typically from locations well outside their intended coverage area. sometimes the weakness of the signal is the challenge, sometimes the amount of interference, and other times the infrequent or irregular schedule of the station.
typically most dx-ing is achieved on the mediumwave band (am band) and the shortwave tropical bands between 2 and 6 mhz. the higher shortwave bands 6 to 30 mhz are generally used for true international broadcasting.
why dx?
it's a challenge. radio propagation isn't constant and many factors influence it. the time of day and the time of year affect the strength of signals. radiation emitted by the sun changes daily which affects the earth's ionosphere as well as the approximate 11 year cycle of sunspot activity. 
the weather and the seasons also dramatically affect vhf propagation, with the summer often allowing stations to be heard from many hundreds of miles. for instance italy, spain and north africa are frequently heard in the uk on fm from may through to september.
