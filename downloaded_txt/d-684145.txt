sega sammy splits video games and pachinko machines into separate companies
february 17th, 2021, 00:04 posted by: wraggstersega sammy will split apart its video games and amusement divisions as part of a new company structure.
in a statement released last week, the japanese firm said it has "been working on structural reform to transform its business structure to adapt to the external environment."
going forward, the organisation will be divided into sega group corporation, which covers its video games operations, and sammy corporation, which encompasses its "pachinko, pachislot, arrange-ball, and jankyu machines"
both will be wholly owned subsidiaries of sega sammy, but will operate as separate companies rather than divisions of a single entity. this will take effect in april this year.
in explaining the decision, sega sammy said that the new structure would be "more efficient" and "[accelerate] decision-making."

toshihiro nagoshi to step down from sega board of directors
february 17th, 2021, 00:02 posted by: wraggsterveteran yakuza producer and executive director toshihiro nagoshi will be stepping down from sega's board of directors on april 1.
he will also be leaving his role as sega's chief creative officer, but will however remain at the company as creative director, kotaku reported.
the yakuza franchise had a successful 2020, with its remastered collection making it to the top ten in the uk charts and its latest entry, yakuza: like a dragon, selling over 450,000 units in asia in just a few months. this good performance boosted sega's financial results for the 12 months ended march 31, 2020, with full-year sales reaching $3.4 billion.

sega sammy reports sharp income decline despite soaring game sales
february 16th, 2021, 22:23 posted by: wraggstersega sammy published its financial result for the nine months ended december 2020, reporting a 51.8% decline in operating income to â¥13.5 billion ($128 million), compared to â¥28 billion ($266 million) for the same period the previous year.
sales also decreased 25.2% year-on-year, generating a total of â¥210 billion ($1.9 billion).
looking at games specifically though, sega reported strong performances with 34.2 million copies shifted, compared to 19.3 million for the same period the previous year. this was mostly driven by sales from its back catalogue, which represented 30.4 million copies. this growth is directly related to people staying at home due to covid-19 measures, the company reported.
games generated â¥102.4 billion ($974 million) in sales during the period, compared to â¥90.2 billion ($858 million) the year before.
full games represented 42.6% of the total sales, 13.8% of which were new physical titles, 28.8% repeat sales of physical games, and 62.8% digital sales. free-to-play transactions also represented 41% of overall sales.

games actually represented the vast majority of the company's revenue for its entertainment content segment, which was overall down 10% to â¥167.6 billion ($1.6 billion), as the segment also includes amusement centers which were closed for several months last year due to covid-19.

battletech - operation revival update
january 24th, 2021, 22:57 posted by: wraggsterin this new update, the gameâs arsenal has been completely modified in one way or another; from a simple ammo increase to a massive increase in damage for one weapon or another. an interesting example is that the autocannon (now renamed ultra autocannon/5), now fires from the madcatâs right arm, which now makes each part of the mech capable of carrying a weapon. of course, this is not the only modification that has been made to the autoccanon, it has also modified its range, rate of fire, damage, etc.; and this is just one example of the work that has been done in the arsenal.
the game system is not the only thing that has been modified, it has also worked on the graphics in a minor way; you will be able to see new icons on the radar map to represent both the enemy units and the ammunition and coolant items.
a new sprite has also been created for the ammunition of the weapons belonging to the c button. instead of collecting a half cylinder similar to coolant, now the player will find an srm 6 missile launcher (for those who are familiar with the battletech franchise), to reload the missile, flamer and mines ammunition.
currently a hexadecimal hacking guide is being developed for battletech, so that anyone who wishes can create their own hack for this game. but until then, wait for new news or contact the developer.
enjoy and have fun!

sonic the hedgehog (1991) prototype discovered
january 3rd, 2021, 11:27 posted by: wraggsterdetermined to start 2021 off on the right foot; infamous scene member 'drx', along with the cutting room floor have uncovered what is long thought to have been lost to the ages.

while a number of sonic the hedgehog 2 (1992) betas and prototypes, including the famous nick arcade build have been floating around the internet since 2006; and then more recently in 2019 we saw the surprise discovery of a sonic the hedgehog 3 (1994) prototype - it's long been thought that any and all early builds of sonic's first outing on sega's 16-bit machine would never be found.

although plenty of early show floor demos and vhs tapes have made their way onto the internet which show glimpses of early sonic 1 footage and a bevy of fan made hoax roms exist - until last night this is all we had to show for sega's first entry in the sonic the hedgehog series.

although an exact build date of the rom is unknown, it's thought to be from mid to late development of the title. a number of zones are near complete while a couple including labyrinth and spring yard zone look quite different from the final product.

here is a list of key differences that has been compiled by members of the scene:
<aside>normal sega startup - no sega choir
no 'sonic team presents' screen
many level layout differences
many level art differences
object placement differences
large rolling ball in ghz
lz is missing water entirely
ufo's present in mz sky
slower lava in mz
missing boss in mz
some instrumentation differences
special stage ring does not appear at end of the level
spring yard zone is known as sparkling zone
star light zone is very unfinished
scrap brain zone shows as clock ork zone
coz is very unfinished
splats (enemy) is present and functional via debug

lunar: eternal blue unworked 2.0 released
december 24th, 2020, 23:53 posted by: wraggsterthe 2.0 version of the lunar: eternal blue unworked patch has been released!
when it was localized by working designs, lunar: eternal blue for sega cd had a lot of very controversial gameplay changes - from needing to use experience points to save the game, to jacking up the difficulty of most fights. this patch reverts all of that back to the japanese version while keeping the official translation, restores the japanese versionâs uncensored graphics, and switches to a much easier-to-read font. no more all-caps dialogue!
the old 1.0 version of the patch was released on the romhacking.net forums, but it had a few cutscenes which would desync along with slow loading times and a few bugs. the new 2.0 version fixes all of those problems while also fixing a large number of issues with the script.

ssf previewver r18(v8)
december 18th, 2020, 13:59 posted by: wraggsterssf previewver r18(v8) is released. ssf is a sega saturn emulator for windows systems using directx 9.0b. the current version claims near-complete implementation of the sega saturn hardware (not counting emulation bugs), and can emulate the saturn based sega titan video arcade hardware too. as with most emulators, cds or disc images are not included and have to be owned separately. the bios is also not included; as of 0.07 beta r3, games run without the bios however. the usage of bios files is optional but recommended for better compatibility, and needed for tasks such as management of the contents of the internal memory of the sega saturn, or setting the system clock.
