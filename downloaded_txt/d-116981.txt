  notice to owners of our black powder “drop-in” barrels: there is a possibility that the nipple on your rifle is defective. metric threaded nipples were inadvertently installed in some barrels instead of the proper ¼-28 threaded nipples. the serial number range in question if for percussion barrels # 030672-031352. do not fire this rifle. please contact us at 603-447-1095 and speak to morgan to arrange return shipping. the barrels will be inspected and if found compliant, returned. if they are discrepant the breech plugs will need to be replaced, so bear with us as this may take a while to complete. we apologize for the inconvenience.
