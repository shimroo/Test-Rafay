primitive
                dolls, country dolls, gingerbread dolls, raggedy ann, raggedy
                andy, beloved belindy, americana, seasonal, pins and
                patterns.  there is something for everyone.
dolls make you feel
                good don't they?  they may bring back childhood memories of
                playing with your doll and imagining all kinds of things for the
                two of you to do together.  maybe you dragged your favorite
                raggedy ann everywhere you went because she was your very best
                friend.  or maybe you are a collector of dolls because you have
                a love and appreciation for them.  no matter what the
                reason is for your love of dolls they bring happiness to your
                life and make you smile.
we all need something
                that brings joy in to our lives. i think a cute raggedy ann with
                a crooked little smile or a doll with a primitive flare to it
                with a kooky look on her face and
                a funny scriggly nose may do the trick.
each doll is designed
                and handmade by the artist.  when you purchase a blackbeary
                forest design, you will receive a signed, dated and numbered
                original doll.
enjoy your browse and
                thank you for looking!
 











note: 
      each item is individually handmade by the artist.  the item you see
      in the photo is not the exact item you will receive (with the exception of
      the "finished dolls ready for

      vary as this is what makes each one unique.  therefore, the fabric and colors
