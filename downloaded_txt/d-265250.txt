											how damaging is water anyway?
									 	

on water damage
did you know that unwanted moisture in a house is just as damaging as fire, termites, or even earthquakes (makes ya think). water that is out of its element, so to speak, and takes up residence in your home can cause a lot of problems that include: 
• rotting of timber structures and finishes such as floor joints, beams, floors, studs, skirting, architraves and frames. • corrosion of metals such as steel reinforcement in concrete, steel beams, lintels, metal door frames etc. • swelling of plasterboards and the subsequent debonding of ceramic tiles. • electrical hazards causing the possible short circuit of lighting and power points. • the blistering of paint. • unsightly deterioration of the building facade. • health problems due to dampness, which may lead to respiratory problems. • rotting carpet.

											what's new in waterproofing materials?
									 	

barrierology 101
keeping water and moisture on its side of the border, so to speak, has been a problem since the flood. over the millenia, folks have tried everything and anything to stem the endless tide: thatch, such as straw, reed, leaves and other dried vegetable matter as a barrier against water entering their home. in time, other more sophisticated waterproofing materials were used. these included: animal skins, timber shingles, and natural stones like slate. the architectural designs of the day such as high pitched roofs helped overcome some of the shortfalls and limitations of the materials that were used. over the centuries other waterproofing materials were used such as metals eg. copper, lead, zinc, and tin. with the discovery of oil, and advances in chemistry more efficient petroleum-derived waterproofing products such as bituminous, butyl rubber, neoprene rubber, hypalon etc.were developed. of course, technology marches on and it won't be long until today's waterproofing membranes such as polyurethanes, acrylics and polyesters will seem as primitive as leaves and animal skins are today.

											what does it cost to have my basement waterproofed?
									 	

the cost of waterproofing
the answer to how much a waterproofing project will cost can be summed up in two words: it depends. every situation is different. costs are determined by the work that needs to be done, the method used to correct the problem. get inspections and estimates from at least three professional waterproofing contractors before hiring someone. in most cases, they will do the estimating and inspections free of charge.

											why do i have cracks in my concrete walls and floor?
									 	

crackology
where do cracks come from? why are they here? where are they going? have puzzled philosophical homeowners for centuries. the short answer seems to be that cracks can be caused by outside forces beyond our control such as an errant 18-wheeler, a settling foundation, or water pressure build up around and/or under your foundation. *its movement that causes your foundation wall to crack. of course, if you had an average of 47 tons resting on you, you'd crack too.
