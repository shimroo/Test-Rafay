emotional education is stressed at the blue school, a private school in manhattan founded by members of the blue man group in 2006. now with 200 students in preschool through third grade, according to the new york times, "the school has become a kind of national laboratory for integrating cognitive neuroscience and cutting-edge educational theory into curriculum, professional development and school design." making kids aware of emotions supposedly helps the academic education process in the school, which is largely child-centered.  read the article. autism and the brain. npr's show "to the best of our knowledge" on sunday, april 15, focused on autism and the brain, including interviews with a variety of experts. from the program blurb: "we explore the frontiers of brain science, from the neurobiology of emotions to recent discoveries about autism.  renowned neuroscientists richard davidson and v.s. ramachandran reveal new insights into the brain, and we'll hear the story of one marriage saved by a diagnosis of asperger syndrome." find the program. (the first segment on autism diagnosis is, in the opinion of 2e newsletter editor l.c. neumann, perhaps the most relevant to the 2e community. decide for yourself.)predicting psychiatric treatment. a finnish longitudinal study has established that that the use of psychiatric treatment or meds as young adults may be predicted by signs and symptoms at age 8. according to science daily, "the parents and the teacher completed questionnaires with items concerning family structure, parental education level, conduct problems, hyperactive problems, emotional symptoms, bullying, and victimisation of bullying behaviour. the children themselves completed questions regarding depressive symptoms, bullying, and victimization of bullying behaviour." find out more. hoagies' page. don't forget that webmistress carolyn k is always updating her ginormous website on all things gifted -- including 2e. what we see on the "what's new" page at the moment is a video of top 10 myths in gifted education; and a list of recently added pages and pointers. find "what's new."might have missed this. the dana print newsletter brain in the news pointed us to an article called "how the brain learns," about timing, sensory systems, and neural interconnectivity. find out about the research -- and about some of the ways the research can apply in the classroom -- at the us news site. nagc annual awards. each year at its annual conference nagc presents a variety of awards. the nomination process for the 2012 awards closes on may 1. award categories include those for educators, researchers, scholars, advocates, and those who otherwise serve the gifted community. find out more. new survey. a phd student at monash university in melbourne, australia, is conducting research to find out about theabilities and achievements of twice-exceptional individuals on the autismspectrum and to find ways that strengths and abilities of people on the autismspectrum can be developed. participantsare sought from the following five groups:adults     with an asdparentsteacherspsychologistsmentorsand coachesaccording to the researcher, the study involves an online questionnaire(approximately 15 minutes) and an option to take part in interviews conductedby e-mail. full details of the study can be found in theexplanatory statement by following the link to the online questionnaire http://tinyurl.com/monasheducation.


















from the publishers of 2e: twice-exceptional newsletter





anxiety is one of the conditions our subscribers are most concerned with when it comes to raising or educating twice-exceptional children. an article in the vancouver sun describes a researcher's efforts to develop a "screen" for anxiety in kindergarten, when kids are screened for vision and hearing. according to the article, about ten percent of kindergartners have anxiety at a level sufficient to interfere with school work or friendships. read more. separately, other researchers speculate that intelligence may have "co-evolved" with worry, noting that the two traits both correlate with certain brain activity. in subjects with generalized anxiety disorder, the researchers found a positive correlation between intelligence and worry; in "normal" subjects, high iq had a negative correlation with worry. find out more. ld in college. a chicago tribune article explores why some college students eligible for special services in college may forgo those, and also looks at the kinds of services available to college students with lds. find the article. autism. those with a stake in how the dsm-5 handles the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders might be interested in an article by a psychiatrist involved in the revision process. he explains the process and explains why the dsm's standards are so important. find the article. separately, npr's diane rehm show on april 11th considered the implications of recent research on our understanding of autism. find the show. finally, harvard university researchers are developing a quick, simple, and supposedly accurate tool for detecting autism in young children. the tool involves a small set of questions and a short home video, and, according to a write-up of the research, "could reduce the time for autism diagnosis by nearly 95 percent, from hours to minutes, and could be easily integrated into routine child screening practices to enable a dramatic increase in reach to the population at risk." find out more. intelligence mapped. a research team based at the university of illinois has reported mapping the physical architecture of intelligence in the brain. the researchers used patients with brain injuries to infer how specific brain structures are associated with various cognitive tasks. included in the map are areas associated with general intelligence and executive function; included with the study write-up is a graphic showing where those areas are supposedly located. read more. april 20th event in new york. an all-day event on april 20th at nassau community college in new york will focus on how educators can help twice-exceptional students succeed. the event is titled "unlocking potential": cost-free strategies to improve underachieving students' performance. find out more.  the gifted homeschoolers forum is now providing online courses for gifted and twice-exceptional students, according to the organization. the first two courses are scheduled to begin in september. find out more.  and finally, this. the company zaner-bloser, "one of the premier publishers of research-based reading, writing, spelling, vocabulary, and handwriting programs," has held and announced the winners of the 21st annual national handwriting contest, in which over 325,000 students participated. entries were judged on size, shape, spacing, and slant. this contest is of interest to us because of the sheer number of entrants, because based on our own sons' education experiences we weren't sure that handwriting was actually taught anymore, and also because we thought everyone now keyboarded instead of writing. find out more about the contest.

game intelligence. howard gardner posits a bodily-kinesthetic form of intelligence, but a new study from sweden indicates that at least some successful athletes also have strong executive function skills that allow them to work with information quickly and make decisions. in the study, elite soccer players in sweden scored in the top two percent on an executive function test, d-kefs. furthermore, higher test scores were linked to higher rates of goals and assists among the players. read more. autism wars is the title of an article in the new york times in reaction to the recent report from the u.s. centers for disease control estimating that one in 88 american kids have an asd. on the one side, those skeptical that the figures really represent a change in asd incidence. on the other side, those who take placement on the spectrum seriously. from the article: “i don’t care if you have a 150 i.q., if you have a social problem, that’s a real problem. you’re going to have problems getting along with your boss, with your spouse, with friends." find the article. oral/written expression discrepancy: a sign of dyslexia? that's the question asked by a teacher/mom whose own daughter's oral expression strengths weren't rewarded by her teacher. the teacher/mom then reflected on her own practice, and that of her peers, deciding that oral expression in the classroom is definitely undervalued. read more. asd in college. as autism and asperger's diagnoses become more common, more and more students will enter college with the diagnosis -- and they'll need help in overcoming issues brought about by poor social skills and other characteristics of the disorder. an article in the minneapolis star-tribune highlights some of those problems and tells what schools and students are doing to overcome those problems. read it. neuroeducation in santa barbara. we love neuroscience, especially as it applies to education, because much of it is or will be beneficial to twice-exceptional students. and we love santa barbara, california. this summer, educators with healthy budgets can attend a four-day, $1975 session on neuroeducation in santa barbara presented by dr. judy willis. titled "neuroscience and the classroom: strategies for maximizing students' engagement, memory, and potential," the event is under the auspices of the learning and the brain summer institute. find out more, and if you go let us know how it was. wrightslaw. the current edition of special ed advocate points out that idea requires transition services from school to employment or to post-secondary education, and provides resources to help parents plan for their learning-disabled child's future. read more.
