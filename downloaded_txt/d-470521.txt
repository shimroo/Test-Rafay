about planetary cyclesin 1994, we first opened our doors in a small 1100 square foot space on n. braeswood.after all this time, two things have not changed: the amazing support we have received from the community, and our dedication to helping our fellow cyclists enjoy the ride. we fully intend to keep the warm atmosphere that has made us unique, if not quirky!thank you and we look forward to seeing you!visit us











greater houston off road cycling association ghorba was formed in september 1999 when the houston area mountain bike riders association (hambra) and the memorial park mountain bike association (mpmba) joined forces to save the trails in memorial park from closure to all cyclists. over the years ghorba has expanded trail interests to dozens of houston area mountain bike trails. ghorba is a non-profit 501c(3) corporation. it generates its operating revenue from your membership dues, organizing tmbra series mountain bike and local races, and grants and donations from cycling and other businesses.  visit ghorba  join ghorba
