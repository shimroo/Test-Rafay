mojo uk:

"fifty years ago, paul mccartney said ta-ra to the beatles and hello to ram, the eccentric, tune-packed solo album that may still be his best. 






in this deluxe bookazine i interview the mixing engineer, eirik wangberg."

tom doyle, internationally acclaimed journalist and author










los angeles apple podcast: in the studio with "the norwegian"
this is a multi-part episode that celebrates paul and linda mccartney's brilliant and influential album ram.













"in this first episode i talk to eirik "the norwegian" wangberg, the engineer who spent two months in a studio with paul mccartney during the making of ram. wangberg's access put him in a unique position as observer and collaborator and he not only paints a vivid picture of paul and linda at that time but he provides additional dimension to paul as an artist.
few people have the ability to provide this kind of insight given the insularity of paul and linda mccartney in 1971 so it was a treat to speak to the charming norwegian.  wangberg was also able to comment on the creation of the album itself as he wore many hats in its construction, ultimately selecting,  sequencing, and mixing the songs on ram."
diana erickson, one sweet dream

together with the fine canadian artist greg wyard: healing melody; premiering at the canadian national exhibition.
