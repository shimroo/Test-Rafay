an engaged mind is a healthy mind
there was a saying my dad always dropped on me when i was loafing around the house as a child: "move it or lose it." this same quote can be applied to our long term mental health.
a mind that is at rest, while peaceful, will be one that quickly fades away. more and more research is pointing out that minds that stay engaged via video games, puzzles, reading, and conversation will last longer and operate as if they are younger. 
many researchers are finding that engaging your mind with puzzle video games is one of the healthiest ways to stay mentally engaged. many people are going out and downloading applications for phones and computers that will allow them to play logic games with their friends and family.
if you play a game of scrabble every day, you will feel more attentive and refreshed. guaranteed.
try to engage yourself with more of these games on a regular basis. there are video games for people of all ages and playstyles, from fun for the whole family type entertainment to more adult themed games, so anybody should be able to stay entertained. it's never too early to start increasing mental acuity.
never thought video games would be healthy, did you?

5 tricks to combat aging with essential vitamins and nutrients
birthdays come every year whether you want to celebrate the day or not, but that's no reason to toddle off into your golden years without putting up a fight. wrinkles, stiff knees, and general fatigue tend to plague us as we get older, but there are a few foods and vitamins that will help make that next birthday easier to bear.
1. calcium
broken hips, weak bones, and skeletal fragility are common with low calcium intake. with at least one in every three adults over the age of 65 experiencing a fall each year, hefty calcium intake might be the only way to avoid a broken bone or serious infection.
2. vitamin d
bones don't absorb calcium if there's no vitamin d in the body. older adults don't process this essential micronutrient well, so vitamin d supplements are something to consider. get more vitamin d from a daily walk in the sun.
3. vitamins c & e
the word "antioxidant" is a popular label on today's anti-aging creams, and with good reason. cells aren't damaged as easily and don't age as fast when vitamins c and e are on the case.
4. olive oil
mediterranean cultures enjoy a low rate of heart disease, and scientists believe it's the olive oil in their diet. try using olive oil to fry food instead of vegetable oil.
5. fish
fish is the best source of omega-3 and may be one of the best ways to prevent heart disease. in the u.s., cardiovascular disease kills more people than any other disease. if you don't like fish, try finding some omega-3 supplements.

											what can i do to prevent memory-loss?
									 	

never again forget where your keys are
memory problems are one of the most common signs of getting along in years. it doesn't have to be that way for you. with a good sleeping pattern, eight glasses of water daily, an improvement in diet, and at least a half hour of exercise a few times per week, your memory will be sharper, more alert, and less likely to forget important details than it has been in years.

											what can i do to prevent wrinkles?
									 	

guard against wrinkles with 30 seconds per day
regardless of gender, make a point to moisturize your face every morning. the moisturizer guards against the dry, dull skin that is more likely to develop premature wrinkles. to add more power to your routine, choose a face lotion containing spf 15 or higher.

											how can i look younger?
									 	

buy a fashion magazine
wearing the right clothes can have a tremendous impact on the age you appear to be. a forty-year-old woman can cause herself to look anywhere from 25 to 55 based on the clothes she wears. pick up a copy of a fashion book and see for yourself the amazing style transformations that are possible. doing so can shed years off of your appearance.
