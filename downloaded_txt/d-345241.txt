it looks like iron from a distance but with all the benefits of aluminum. i highly recommend this product.     attention to detail and carei received my order this evening and opened up the boxes as soon as i reach home. i was overwhelmed by the quality of the handrail and all associated parts and the fact that they included a drill bit with each handrail. the manufacturer's attention to detail and care for the consumer along with adaptability for their product is more than anyone could hope for.      great railing kit great railing kit, easy assembly & looks amazing!

i had a 10-extension put onto the end of my garage in 4 x 4 construction. i used 2 x 4 for the cross-members at 2' off ground and then put the screen system in the openings. i love it! i needed some help installing the channels, only because i was short on time and i don't have the upper body strength of a man to accomplish it quickly. my man and i installed the upper screens (44" x 70") together but i did the lower screens (44" x 24") with a little help from my mom. the flat spline installation is so much easier and more snug than the normal round spline you get with screens. i would recommend this to anyone!     tremendous productthe installation instructions were very good which made the install less complicated. once we got the 1st rail install, everything went like clock work. i as well as my client were thrilled with the simplicity of the overall design of both the rail & balusters. i will recommend installing this product on all future deck and screen porch installations. quick delivery. great price. easy installation. tremendous looking product!!!

please do not ever discontinue this as it is a winner! i ordered the 8' section because the spacing between my posts is 7.5 feet. i use a makita saw to cut the aluminum to fit the space. if i can install this and it looks beautiful and maintenance free anyone can!

    installation in no timeit is easy to put together. two people can install in no time. believe me if my husband and i can do it anyone can.     exceeded my expectationsthis handrail exceeded my expectations in several ways. it was easy to install following the clearly written instructions (not just pictures). i mounted in on vinyl siding and was worried it would alter the appearance of the siding by creating "indents" from the mounts. it did not! it has provided me with the safety of climbing the steps at my entrance without diminishing the appearance of my home's front door entryway. i am very pleased with this handrail and highly recommend it.     very useful nice looking product this was a very useful and nice looking product for us to use on steep outdoor stairs. ‑amy     will last a lifetime i built a 40 foot railing on the side of a steep hill. the hillside had varying slope angles so these adjustable angles worked perfect. they adjust any direction you need. extremely high quality. will last a lifetime. ‑bill join our newsletter  thank you for signing upplease correct the marked field(s) below.1,true,6,contact email,21,false,1,first name,21,false,1,last name,2your opinion matterslet us know what you think. click to leave feedback about your experience.visiting our location? get directions call us today at 573-365-7040 copyright © 2022 madden manufacturing | web design by baltimore web designprivacy policy  |  terms & conditionsaboutcontact
