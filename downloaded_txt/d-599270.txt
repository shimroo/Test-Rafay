"now is the
time for all good men to
come to the aid of their country"
corline "jack" jackson

1917-1918
corline did come
to the aid of his country during world war i.
he was my grandfather. i last found him on record on the
1920 census of watertown, jefferson county, wi. 
his "whereabouts" were unknown after 1925 until
i found a record of his death in portland, multnomah county,
oregon.
many
thanks to ancestry.com for their on-line records and to
the state of oregon for their friendly and expeditious
response to my order for a death certificate.
for a larger
photo of corline and for other photos of lost,
missing, and unknown persons, visit my web site:
"lost and found & some just
plain missing"
there are many
wisconsin photos here.
and as of january 2002 i am adding
midwest images - unknown photos from iowa & kansas
and will soon be adding unknown photos from texas.

long live old
photos!!!
faces &
places without a home. another great
photo site of "unknowns" just waiting
for you to claim them as your own
visit here
~~~~~~~~~~~
attention
adoptees
speaking of
faces without a name, please visit my site titled
"rootless"
this site is
dedicated to a good friend of mine who is not only
an adoptee but also a birth mother who is looking for her
first born son. the place was hennepin county, mn and 
the year was 1973. on the site there are pictures of both
john (the adoptee) and michael, her second born.
update: 
as a birth mother, she has found her son.
as as adoptee, she has found her birth mother & siblings.
it can be done !!!
~~~~~~~~~~~
a current and
ongoing project of mine is the reproduction
of biographies for wisconsin and vermont
for the us biographies project.
i found valuable
information on my krueger
and henze lines from the wisconsin biographies:
us biographies project - jefferson
county, wi
the 1879 publication is
complete
us biographies project - dodge county,
wi
wisconsin biographies project
for links to other counties
vermont biographies project
~~~~~~~~~~~
another ongoing
project (probably a life-time project) is the
reproduction of biographies for tolland & windham counties,
connecticut from a 1903 publication. i found a lot of 
genealogical information on my white, allen & hall lines
amongst the 1250 valuable pages of this book.

commemorative biographical record of tolland and windham counties connecticut
publisher: j.h. beers & co., chicago; 1903
~~~~~~~~~~~
a project that i
have just completed is the reproduction of a 
list of the names of teachers, staff and pupils for the 1882-1883
school year for the town of berlin, green lake county, wi.
included is a list of graduates from the years 1865-1882 and
where they were in 1882. there is also a picture (etching)
of the berlin high school on the web site:
berlin public schools - berlin, wi
1882-1883
~~~~~~~~~~~
i have also
completed recently the pages for several web sites 
that i am hosting for the usgenweb project and the
american history genealogy project. they are 
"town" sites and relatively easy to maintain and
volunteers 
are always needed. visit my town sites:

connecticut

county, connecticut
canaan, litchfield county, connecticut

my next project
is a cemetery page that will include my family
listings along with other folks picked up and noted along the
way. 
locations include texas, connecticut, wisconsin and iowa. 
check back now and then to see if i have made progress with this
project.
i recently returned from wisconsin and have approximately 
200 cemetery listings from the counties of
waupaca, waukesha, jefferson and dodge
as soon as i can
"unscramble & organize" the info, it will be
available for viewing.

update: listings
now available on-line
rural home cemetery - big bend, waukesha
co., wi
(partial listing with photos)
rural home cemetery - big bend, waukesha
co., wi

donated by: james and phyllis koelsch
graceland cemetery - clintonville,
waupaca co., wi
~~~~~~~~~~~
following is a
travel itinerary of places on the web that i have
visited and found interesting & fruitful enough to bookmark
for return visits and research. and if you are a
"non-retired"
working stiff like me with limited research time 
(for whatever
reason)
i thought that
you might appreciate
a little "jump start" on your search for your
ancestors.
good luck
&
happy hunting
