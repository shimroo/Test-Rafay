clarification on iel class at gold coast finale









based on input and anticipated entries, we are making a modification to the iel class at the upcoming gold coast finale classes. 
iel classes will be run as “overlay” classes with the corresponding gold coast classes. this means that iel novice equitation will be run with 2’0” 12 & over equitation, and iel freshman jumpers will be run concurrent with .80 jr/am jumpers. iel riders will be judged in the regular gold coast class and be placed accordingly. in addition, iel riders will be ranked among themselves and receive iel ribbons for their placing. riders will only jump one round and will pay one entry fee.
for riders wanting to receive iel ribbons, results, and points, please enter the iel classes you want to compete in. you will automatically be entered into the corresponding gold coast class.
be sure to enter via ring radar and get entries submitted early. gold coast finale will accept the first 200 horses entered.
good luck and we will see you at gold coast finale!
