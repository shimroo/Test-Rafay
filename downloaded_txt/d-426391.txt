what our members say about
enp network







as a small, newly formed all-volunteer organization we struggled with the task of tracking and managing our memberships and renewals, but after 5 years with enp our membership has exponentially grown (and continues each month to grow). we find the website is very easy and intuitive to use, it has reliably provided us with the means to communicate with our current and potential members.  we have managed several successful events using the enp event tool, and feedback from our members has been positive and they are pleased with the ease of registration and updates. the enp team has always been responsive to our needs and suggestions. the tools enp provides have allowed our organization to become financially stable which in turn allows us to better serve our members...
