gallery newswe’re on the move!we’re writing to share some big news with you.in 2023, we celebrated our 20th anniversary. we hope you had a chance to see our survey exhibition twenty featuring works by more than 50 international artists from throughout our history, as well as our two subsequent solo exhibitions michael brennan: floating weeds and sharon brant: change and recurrence.at the end of april 2024, we shut down our gallery space at 16 main street in dumbo, brooklyn, and are currently working to move the gallery closer to home. just prior to the start of the pandemic, we moved our family from brooklyn to south orange, new jersey, which is located just west of newark and easily accessible by train from penn station. south orange and our surrounding communities have had a vibrant arts and cultural community for more than two centuries.we are currently in the market for a new permanent home for the gallery, which will host our public exhibitions, educational programming, advocacy and philanthropic work, library and archives, book and editions, inventory storage, and so much more. we are also planning to make our new venue completely green and sustainable, especially in response to the acceleration of climate change. we will announce complete details about our new location as soon as we have them.in the meantime, we are open for business here on our website, our artsy page, and by private appointment. we also plan to enrich the content available through on our website, share meaningful information by email and social media, host online conversations, and possibly organize an in-person curatorial project or two in the near term.but most of all, we would like to thank all of you -- the artists, curators, writers, editors, publishers, gallerists, collectors, advisors, architects, designers, art historians, arts administrators, donors, our landlord two trees, and our audience worldwide for your extraordinary, unwavering support of our programming over these many years. we are grateful to you.onward! matthew & rossana* our new interim mailing address is p.o. box 1093, south orange, nj 07079, usa.* our email address remains the same as always: info@minusspace.com.
