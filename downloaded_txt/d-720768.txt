the piano lab





the piano lab specializes in all aspects of musical learning for ages newborn to adult with private piano, voice, group piano lessons and kindermusik classes.


                                                
as the world´s most respected name in musical learning, kindermusik has been enriching the lives of children and their families for over three decades. the piano lab has been awarded the kindermusik top program award, the highest recognition awarded by kindermusik international for profoundly impacting the mission to reach all children with the benefits of kindermusik.  




“environment is great for social skills interaction, musical education and basic life skills. students become more confident with each lesson. i am always amazed at the positive progress my children (3) have made in every semester they’ve attended. our educator makes music fun and is a hit with the kids. she conducts a very nurturing environment.”  a. jones

“i have recommended kindermusik to friends and they are now enrolled and beginning their second year of enjoyment!”  e.c.
“the curriculum is fabulous but the delivery of it by a masterful instructor gives life to the lessons.”  sue k.
