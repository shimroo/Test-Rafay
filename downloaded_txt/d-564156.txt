welcome to sun safety for kids
a nonprofit organization developed by dermatologists of the 
								los angeles metropolitan dermatological society
the risk of developing skin cancer will be 
								substantially reduced for children who learn to 
								"block the sun, not the fun!"  sun safety for kids is 
								dedicated to reducing the incidence of skin 
								cancer through teaching and promoting sun 
								protection to children.
								 
sun protection 
								methods include wearing hats and 
								long clothing, seeking shade, and much more. 
								>>>
								 
school policy is needed because students and 
								personnel are exposed to the sun's 
								cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation while at 
								school. >>>
								 
resources 
								are provided to assist schools in finding hats, 
								sunscreen, shade trees, and shade structures. 
								there are also activity sheets, sample 
								curriculum, and more! 
								>>>
								 
								see a preview and order  
the sun show, the 
								original educational videos produced by sun 
								safety for kids for children ages 6-11.
