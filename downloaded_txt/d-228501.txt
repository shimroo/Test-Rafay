corrigan provided excellent communication and customer service from the beginning. they made sure to check in throughout my move, were receptive to my questions, took great care in handling my possessions and did what they’d say they’d do. the move went smoothly and stayed on schedule. moves are stressful at best but corrigan ensured that this aspect of the move was one less thing to have to worry about.

i was in charge of helping my mother-in-law move. mike s at corrigan who came out and did the estimating, did a great job helping explain the whole process to me since i had never done a cross country move. the whole process went so smoothly and everyone was so helpful and informative. i could not have been happier throughout this whole process.
