eccelsiastes 3:1-4, to every thing there is a season, and a time to
    every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time
    to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill, and
    a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to
    weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.

i hope that you have enjoyed and been blessed by the sugar sticks that buddy
has faithfully sent to encourage and strengthen believers in the lord jesus
christ. it is with very mixed emotions that i write this note to you to inform
you that buddy went home to be with the lord on sunday, january 19, 2003
   
buddy dano
may 20, 1922  january 19, 2003

 psalm 116:15, precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his
    saints.

buddy will definitely be missed, as well as his gracious communication of
gods holy word. but we know that he is in a better place with no more
sorrow, no more tears, no more pain, and no more death. he has gone from
grace to glory.
buddy has written several publications about the home going of a believer. at
this time you may want to review them on the divine viewpoint web site. they
include:
commanded to comfort
from here to eternity
the homegoing of a christian
cancer to christ

departure

john 14:1-3, let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in god, believe
    also in me. in my fathers house are many mansions: if it were not so, i
    would have told you. i go to prepare a place for you. and if i go and
    prepare a place for you, i will come again, and receive you unto myself;
    that where i am, there ye may be also.

ephesians 2:8-9, for by grace you have been saved through faith; and
    that not of yourselves: it is the gift of god: not of works, lest any man
    should boast.

psalm 84:11, for the lord god is a sun and shield: the lord will give
    grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
    uprightly.


it has been an honor and blessing to be a part of this ministry the past years.
i will continue to maintain the  divine viewpoint web site and will add
additional bible studies previously taught by buddy as time permits.

you first of all that which i also received, how that christ died for our sins
according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the
third day according to the scriptures,
  1 corinthians 15:1.
abraham believed god, and
it was counted unto him for righteousness. now to him that works (for salvation)

counted for righteousness,

isaiah 55:8.
