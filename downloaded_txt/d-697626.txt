bibliodrama:

i will never read the bible the same way again
a blend of scholarship and art,
bible and drama 
combining a close reading of biblical texts with searching, imaginative questions, bibliodrama offers people of all ages and levels of knowledge an opportunity to experience a method of creative study that since 1984 has changed the way we read the bible.
