forever on our minds - franklin county, ga.

welcome to franklin county, georgia





				 franklin county, georgia, is where beauty and history are remarkable, where heritage and tradition are dear to our hearts, and where this rural area filled with friendly, hard-working residents is forever on our minds. our location only 80 miles northeast of atlanta, georgia and 60 miles southwest of greenville, south carolina means our businesses enjoy the benefits of being close to the southeast’s major centers of industry, while our families can grow in the friendly, relaxed communities of canon, carnesville, franklin springs, lavonia and royston, georgia. residents and visitors especially enjoy the many outdoor activities at two georgia state parks, lake hartwell and championship golf courses throughout the region.
