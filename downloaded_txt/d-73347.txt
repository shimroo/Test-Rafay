				“in 10+ years of working with web technologies, i say with confidence that stylizer is absolutely in a class of its own. it sports one of the most well designed interfaces in the history of software. stylizer has had a tremendous impact on workflow here at iq storage. best of luck to the immensely talented team at skybound.”
				— simon lightstone, iq storage


				“stylizer has revolutionized the way we create websites. its introduction into our agency has made cross-browser compatibility a breeze, and the speed our workflow continues to multiply. stylizer is the best css-layout software on the market and has become vital to our agency.” 
				— richard albrecht, ceo, siteway webdesign agency


				“great software that's far ahead of others.”
				— david radovanovic, whatsthebigidea.com


				“i love your software. after trying them all and really never finding anything that fit me until i came across stylizer. from that moment on i have never dreamed of using another program for my css editing.”
				— andrew taylor, entice media


				“whenever i talk to css ninjas about stylizer they look at me like i'm gutenberg, proposing movable type in a monastery of copying monks or something. it's funny. i mean, would you build your own car? churn your own butter? wash your clothes by hand? so why write css like a caveman, right?”

				“stylizer is the greatest css editor you will ever own. period. no other css editing program compares. designing css manually can be extremely difficult and frustrating. the benefit of stylizer is that you can quickly fix css problems and see how code changes will appear visually. for instance, at avst, we rely heavily on the adobe creative cloud suite to build our websites . although adobe recently improved their css editor , it is still not as easy and not as powerful as stylizer. if you are designing a website without stylizer, you are wasting valuable time. it is a miracle tool that will pay for itself over and over again. at avst, we strive for great design on our websites and stylizer allows us to achieve this with ease.”
				— c.j. land, avst


				“i more than love stylizer, i need it! your software has allowed me to make a living doing web design. seriously, i have no clue how i would be doing my job without it. i’ve learned so much css just by using your software and getting instant feedback using the slider controls. love seeing all the options each css rule is capable of too. this makes css editing in firebug and the web developer toolbar look like ms-dos. sooo glad you are still supporting it and i wish you so much success with it. there is absolutely nothing like it out there on the pc that is as easy to use... and i have looked.”
