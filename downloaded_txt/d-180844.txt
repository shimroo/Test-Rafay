step into an alaska experience


native tlingit culture
icy strait point is alaska native owned-and-operated, with all profits directly supporting the community of hoonah, alaska’s largest native tlingit village. our dedicated staff (85% of which call hoonah home) is committed to providing a one-of-a-kind experience for every guest that is infused with our local native culture and hospitality.


unspoiled wilderness
chichagoff island is home to more brown bears than humans, its a place where eagles soar overhead and whales are regularly seen just offshore. surrounded by towering rainforest and set against the backdrop of mist-shrouded mountains, guests can truly immerse themselves in our wilderness environment.


alaska-sized adventure
with over 30 exciting tours, a restored 1912 salmon cannery and museum, nature trails, and even a beach! icy strait point is the port for adventure.  fly down the world's largest ziprider, whale-watch in the nutrient-rich waters of port frederick and point adolphus,  search for the coastal brown bears that inhabit the area, and soar high above in a helicopter.










wildlife & bear search
journey from icy strait point into the wilds of chichagof island as you explore the spasski river valley in search of local wildlife.
