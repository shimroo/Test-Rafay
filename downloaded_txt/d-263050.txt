the great lakes maritime
                          institutes most recent project was the
                          recovery of the 6,000 pound bow anchor of the
                          s.s. greater detroit and its exhibition at the
                          detroit/wayne county port authority building.
                          on november 15, 2016, the anchor was
                          successfully raised and on national maritime
                          day, may 22, 2017,  it was dedicated in a
                          display at the detroit/wayne county port
                          authority building.

in july 1992 glmi carried
                          out a similar project when the anchor of the
                          s.s. edmund fitzgerald was recovered from the
                          bottom of the detroit river. that anchor is
                          currently resting in the yard of the dossin
                          great lakes museum on belle isle. 

by using the detroit river webcam that is mounted
                        on the top of the william clay ford pilothouse
                        you are able to see the anchor from the s.s.
                        edmund fitzgerald on belle isle. 





the glmis last anchor
                            fundraiser also provided the funds to send a
                            recovery team to baltimore, maryland where
                            the s.s. south american was being scrapped
                            in 1992. the group recovered a number of
                            artifacts from the vessel just before it was
                            dismantled. our group was fortunate to have
                            the opportunity to recover a number of port
                            holes and document the condition of the
                            vessel before it was destroyed in a fire
                            while it was being scrapped. 

                            the glmi also helped pay for the
                            installation of the s.s. william clay ford
                            pilothouse, a thirty by thirty foot steel
                            and glass addition to the dossin great lakes
                            museum. this artifact was taken off the
                            vessel  intact before it was scrapped.
                            when one visits the dossin great lakes
                            museum you will be walking into an actual
                            working pilothouse from a great lakes
                            freighter that was built at the great lakes
                            engineering works at river rough/ecorse,
                            michigan. 
 
the detroit river webcam
                          was one of the projects that the glmi was able
                          to help fund. it allows an individual to
                          actually control the camera that is mounted on
                          the mast of the s.s. william clay ford
                          pilothouse.
