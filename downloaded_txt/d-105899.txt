the trouble with judging others
luke 6:36-42
by rev. frank schaefer







our topic today is judging others so i thought i do some research on 
christian books that deal with this issue. i came across a rather controversial 
book by pastor jason t. berggren. his book is entitled 10 things i hate 
about christianity 
the first point he makes in his book is about how judgmental 
christianity is. he says: if we must point fingers, lets point fingers at 
ourselves. [1]





in contrast, atheist philosopher alaine de botton wrote a book 
entitled: religion for atheists in which he points to the positives and 
strength of religions. rather than mocking religions, de botton says agnostics 
and atheists should instead steal from them. religions are packed with good 
ideas on how we might live. in particular, he points to how religions 
successfully...
a. build a sense of community
b. make relationships last, 
c. go traveling (pilgrimages)
d. use art, architecture and music
e. address emotional needs. [2]





so, if even an atheist philosopher can see some good in christianity, lets 
not throw out the baby with the bathwater. even with the judgmental attitude the 
church often portrays, there are redeeming qualities that give us hope. 





what does it look like to be non-judgmental: i think we got that down pretty 
well actually: we accept, welcome and support all people in our churchwithin 
reason (we would challenge some that potentially walk through out doors, but i 
will elaborate on this point later). fact is, we are not known to try to convert 
those who think or believe differently from us. in fact, there are several among 
us this morning who would identify as buddhist, jewish, and agnostics this 
morning. 
of course, our evangelical brothers and sisters would challenge us: if you 
dont convert people, if you dont oppose false beliefs, how are you a 
christian? how are you making disciples? dont we need some degree of judgment 
in the process of disciple-making? the assumption being that our religion is 
more helpful than other religions; or that our doctrine more accurately 
describes god than other doctrines.
these are questions we should take seriously as progressive christians. i 
will reflect on these questions in the following discourse. i want to make three 
important points about judging others as it applies to our progressive theology:

1. we may not challenge anybody on how they believe, butwe do make judgments 
about bad policies, discrimination, inequality, and injustice. we may even 
challenge people who hold to such policies, but we do not typically judge the 
person. in my talks with conservatives about lgbtq inclusion, i am always 
mindful of the fact that i myself at one point thought the way they do. i may 
have a different understanding now, but i have no right to judge them as a 
person.
2. our judgments are usually based on trying to tear down walls and include 
those who are marginalized and suffer from social injustice. we oppose that 
judgmental attitude and say: we are all gods children and we are all welcome 
and we are all entitled to the resources god so generously provided for all of 
us. in a sense you could say that we are judging those who judge others. but i 
think thats one judgment that is ok to make, especially if we make it to point 
out the injustice while we stand by our oppressed brothers and sisters.
3. we should follow jesus example when it comes to living our christianity. 
jesus approach was not one of teaching conversion, or judging others. jesus 
approach was one of care and compassion for the poor, the sick, the blind, and 
the outcasts. he occasionally did have harsh words for the corrupt religious 
leaders of his time, but you could make an argument for the fact that when he 
did so, he did it to stand up for the poor and the outcastjesus was fighting 
against social injustice in those moments.
let me put jesus message in perspective to that of john the baptist. jesus 
started out as one of johns disciples. and johns message was clearly one of 
judgment, one that cast fear into the hearts of people. jesus message was one 
of compassion and care, one that cast hope into the hears of the people. [continue]
