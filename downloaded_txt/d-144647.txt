the r.a.l.e.â® repository presents digital recordings of respiratory sounds in health and disease.â these are breath sounds that doctors, nurses, respiratory and physical therapists hear with a stethoscope when they auscultate the chest of a patient.
try r.a.l.e. lung sounds which offers an extensive collection of sound recordings and case presentations, including a quiz for self-assessment, and see for yourself.
