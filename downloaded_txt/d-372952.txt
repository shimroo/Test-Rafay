discovering 
                                      and rediscovering the history of the civil 
                                      war
our nation 
                                      was born in 1776, but it only came of age 
                                      during the civil war. the united states 
                                      is unique in that it will stand tall for 
                                      freedom and democracy - even when the path 
                                      it must take is difficult and unforgiving. 
                                      it was the experience of the civil war that 
                                      gave birth to this ideal - and as we learn 
                                      about its people, places and events we continually 
                                      gain a deeper appreciation for the foundation 
                                      they provided, so that we may build an even 
                                      greater nation.

                                      we hope this website provides a great way 
                                      to bringing together the civil war historical 
                                      community. we appreciate your feedback and 
                                      suggestions, and we look forward to providing 
                                      more features to help keep the appreciation 
                                      of history strong and vibrant.
