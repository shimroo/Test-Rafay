ghost of the 
      doll is an id website dedicated to toys of 
      the 1980's and 1990's (plus a few 2000's thrown in 
      for good measure)! here you can reminisce whilst browsing 
      through an extensive selection of toys, view commercials 
      and chat in the forum.    
toys ~ you can view toys alphabetical order,  by decase (1980's, 1990's and 2000's) by type (dolls organised by size and theme, and plush/plastic 
      animals organised by species), as well as grouped 
      by  manufacturer, which also includes 
      a brief historical timeline of the main toy makers. 
      if you are interested in a toy which isn't listed 
      here yet please visit my forum and 
      go to the new toy sections board 
      to see if it's in there!
forum ~ the forum 
      has boards dedicated to toy id help, 
      so if you need help working out what something is, 
      this is the place to go! amongst others, there are 
      also boards for sales/wants as well 
      as general toy discussion. you'll 
      also find a board dedicated to new toy sections, 
      where members can post images and information of toys 
      not currently featured on gotd, plus a board for adding 
      to the current toy sections too. i also run anÂ id group on facebook for toys of any decade: ghost of the doll: toy id.
toy 
          sales ~ secondhand modern / vintage

          food toys, games and books found on my travels around charity shops
