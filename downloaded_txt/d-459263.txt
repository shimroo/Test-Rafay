i have been searching for the patricia st johns but could not find them anywhere till i came across kingsley press. i had bought a couple of her titles in the early 90s and i enjoyed them very much. thank you for this website.

i was asked to give a comment...christian books have always been extremely important to me...i can read many books, but the books i have purchased from kingsley press penetrate the heart and i can hear the holy spirit speaking through the writings...
