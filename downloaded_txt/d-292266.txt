 albanian 
                      language! 



albanian 
                      or shqip is the oldest indo-european language spoken by 
                      some six million inhabitants of the western balkan peninsula 
                      in south-eastern europe (albanians). there are two principal 
                      dialects of limited mutual intelligibility: tosk and gheg. 
                      tosk is spoken in southern and central albania, by the arbëreshë 
                      of italy, among the albanian minority of greece: the çam 
                      and the arvanites, and in small communities of albanian 
                      immigrants in ukraine, turkey, egypt, and the united states. 
                      gheg (or geg) is spoken in central and northern albania 
                      also by the albanians of serbia and montenegro (including 
                      kosovo) as well as those of the republic of macedonia.more
