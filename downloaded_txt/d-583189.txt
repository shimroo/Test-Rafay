the art of the west


the history of the american west is a subject that has captured the imagination of people around the world and  from all walks of life. for some the attraction may be the tales of heroic deeds of the pioneers, the native american warriors or their nemesis - the us cavalry. for others perhaps the image of the cowboy as a wild and independent spirit, or simply 
            the beauty and grandeuer of americaâs western scenery. 

            there is a long tradition of artists capturing the scenes and deeds of the old west on canvas, and we are fortunate that so many of todayâs fine artists continue this tradition. there are many truly fine works depicting the wildlife and scenery of the western states, and a wide selection of pieces portraying the characters who populated the west in days past, and in some cases still do today. we hope you will take a moment to view some of these art works here on our website, and perhaps allow us to assist in bringing a little of the old west into your home, or office.
