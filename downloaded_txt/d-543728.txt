winning child custody visitation and divorce child custody rights information









child custody definition: child custody can become an issue when parents with children divorce or separate.  this breakdown in the parents relationship will require a restructuring of the family.  parental custody rights, responsibilities and the type and amount of contact the children have with each parent will need to be sorted out.  if parents cannot work out and agree on responsibilities and a parenting arrangement, the court will step in to make a legal custody and physical custody determination, typically using the "best interest of the child" standard.












types of custody: there are two main types of custody, legal and physical.  legal custody pertains to decision making rights and responsibilities.  physical custody pertains to where the child lives and is more often the point of contention for parents getting a divorce.  legal and physical custody can also be described as primary, sole, joint and temporary or permanent.











child custody rights: when parents are married they typically have equal parenting rights and share guardianship over their children, and upon separation, have an equal right to child custody.  parents who are not married may not get the same benefit of these presumed child custody rights upon separation.  it may depend on your state child custody laws and statutes.












child custody unmarried: unmarried parents can petition the court for the same types of child custody arrangements as divorced parents, but depending on state child custody laws, an unmarried father may not be presumed to have the right to custody of his child.  he may need to establish paternity before he can get custody and visitation rights.   after a paternity action, child support is generally set according to state law child support guidelines or standards.












child custody laws: each state has its own child custody visitation statutes for making custody awards or modifications, but most all use some form of the "best interest of the child" standard, taking into consideration any relevant factors that pertain to the health, safety and welfare of the child.  joint custody statutes, child custody for fathers, mothers rights, grandparent visitation rights and domestic violence and child custody laws can vary by state.











child custody advice: education is one of your best assurances for a winning custody arrangement that reflects your child's best interest.  how to win child custody e-book provides exclusive information, tips and strategies to help you assess, document and develop a child-centered and child-focused parenting plan.  for one-on-one help with your specific situation you can schedule a phone or in-person meeting.  below are some common meeting topics.
