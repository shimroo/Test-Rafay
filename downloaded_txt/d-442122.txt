about the local choice










more than 60,000 employees, retirees and family members representing 335 local virginia jurisdictions participate in the commonwealth of virginiaâs the local choice (tlc) health benefits program. state governmentâs significant purchasing power reduces administrative costs, and shared claims experience offers financial protection for local government. competitive trend estimates and value added benefits also enable the local choice to compete effectively in todayâs health care marketplace. tlc offers financial stability through competitive rates, quality benefit plans and superior customer service.
