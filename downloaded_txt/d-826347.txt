who we are








            about us
          










in 1979, a small group founded the nonprofit black hills health & education center in hermosa, south dakota (just 25 miles south of rapid city). recognizing the healing aspects of pure air, sunlight, temperance, exercise, proper nutrition, rest, water, and trust in divine power, the visionaries resolved to offer an affordable medical retreat program for people with health concerns. the mission of this organization hasn't changed. thousands of people have found health and healing by learning and applying the time-tested method of whole-health recovery.  as the full name implies, the center is focused on health restoration through education in various forms. each month, the lifestyle center offers a 10-day supervised medical lifestyle program that addresses the prevalent diseases that plague our society.  with a statistically documented and proven record of success, current research has consistently verified that simple lifestyle changes can produce improvements within a very short time. what an incredible transformation occurs in the lives of our patients in just 10 days of adjustments to their lifestyles!  in addition to the lifestyle medicine center programs, black hills offers a 650-hour, massage therapy course. graduates of the school of massage are then qualified to take national boards and receive their state licensure.  our school is one of a select few faith-based massage programs in the country.  if you would care to know more, you are invited to call, email, or, better yet, visit our campus. if you make advanced arrangements, we would be happy to give you a tour of the lovely campus and, (if it’s around lunchtime), you are invited to stay for a delicious plant-based meal featuring fresh produce from our certified naturally grown garden, (in the summer).
