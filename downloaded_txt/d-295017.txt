trust and the golden rule





 i did a fantastic job following the golden rule yesterday,  largely because the only people i saw were my eightysomething mother and  the twentysomething barista at the coffee bar. and, yes, i was able to  be nice to both of them. somehow, i don’t think it’s going to be this  easy the rest of the year. also, thanks to everyone for the great conversation about the meaning  of the golden rule. (commentators noted: if the golden rule means doing  unto others as you want to be done unto, then don’t we run the risk of  ignoring other people’s wishes? how the heck do you know if what you  want is what someone else wants? we have to take care of ourselves first  before we can be there for other people. stress can undermine our  effort to be good, and yes, we need to reframe our irritations and  angers into positive statements to avoid strangling each other. ) but the topic for today is trust — that is, trust and the golden  rule. how can i treat others  as nicely as i want to be treated if i  fear that they are going to stab me in the neck — either literally or  metaphorically — while i’m standing around being pleasant to them?  continue reading →

seeking goodness in a new way





i spent 365 days attempting to answer the question: what is goodness?  since i completed that quest on june 1, i’ve been bumbling around  trying to figure out what to do next. my year-long journey was  wonderful. challenging, fun, intellectually exciting, and in the end, it  did enable me to form my first theory of goodness.  looking back, i think it’s rather grandiose to call that a theory; it’s  actually more of a hunch of mine — that goodness is a skill. but i did  do what i set out to do, and for that, i am pleased. but my teeth itch. something’s not quite right here.continue reading →

shameless self promotion





the august issue of the progressive magazine is  out now, and it includes my essay, “was my father evil?” my essay  is  not available online, so go forth and purchase an old-fashioned hard  copy of the thing. tell them diane sent you. meanwhile, their website  does have an interesting excerpt from an interview with writer and war correspondent chris hedges.

are we good, or just lucky?





i’ve spent the past year seeking to understand the true heart of  good human beings. i’ve asked everybody i could to answer the question:  what is goodness? imagine my surprise when i interviewed macarthur fellow jonathan shay last  week and discovered that goodness may have an aspect i  never  considered before. a good person, in fact, may be nothing more than a  lucky person.  continue reading →

falling off the empathy cliff into evil





 simon baron-cohen argues that evil should be defined as the absence of empathy. in his new book, the science of evil: on empathy and the origins of cruelty,  the university of cambridge professor of developmental psychology  proposes replacing the “unscientific term ‘evil’ with the scientific  term ‘empathy.” new  york times reviewer katherine bouton explains:  continue reading →

the anti-sam harris points to a real moral operating system





 google engineering director damon horowitz tackles  the idea of using numbers and science to make ethical decisions and  comes up with a delightfully different answer than sam harris did in the  moral landscape. watching horowitz’ ted talk, i’m energized and  hopeful, which is a far different reaction than the one i had when  reading harris’ book.   continue reading →

what's next?





 the task i set for myself more than a year ago has been  completed. i haven’t found the meaning of life, or even goodness, but i  did do what i said i would do: after 365 days of research i came up with  an answer to the question: what is goodness. hooray me! but i don’t  feel like i can let this goodness thing go. not yet.  continue reading →

my first theory of goodness





 my year is up. no more dodging the issue. it’s time for me to  answer my own question: what is goodness? to do that, however, i have to  first talk about god, moral codes and baseball.  continue reading →

should goodness ever be defined, or what have i done?





 no more dodging the issue for me. tomorrow is the 365th day of my  quest, which means i have to finally give you my definition of  goodness. before i went to wiscon last week, i drafted that post, loaded  it onto the blog, and boarded the plane to madison feeling darn-right  smug. i thought i’d come up with a fetching and irrefutable answer.but  then i got to wiscon, and started trying out my  spiffy new definition  on other people. oh dear.   continue reading →

how i've been changed





 nearly 365 days.  almost 525,948 minutes. that’s how long i’ve  been thinking about the question of goodness. not every minute, of  course. there’s been sleeping, laughter, work and movies. but i’ve never  been so focused on a single question for so long in my life. even  coming out as a lesbian didn’t take this long.  as the year has  progressed i’ve realized that the journey has touched me in unexpected  ways. here are just a few.  continue reading →

housekeeping





for some reason, i wasn't able to transfer copy from my goodness project blog to this blog while i was away the last few weeks. everything else worked great from a mobile platform, but i couldn't get the transfers to work, so finally, after a short delay here are opening blurbs and links to more than a week's worth of the goodness project.
