  insulator identification
  
 this website is a place for photos of all insulators – not just glass from north america. this is a place where you will find photos and information on insulators from around the world! i hope to get a photo of each known cd, u, m, st and gs-numbered insulator from inside and outside the us. the site is continually growing. in fact, it is the only website with a complete gallery of all reported styles of us battery rest insulators, largest curated photo gallery of unipart and multipart style insulators and home to two identification systems (st and gs)
