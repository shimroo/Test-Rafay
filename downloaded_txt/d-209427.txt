a modern legacy of culinary excellence since 1937


























hyeholde's story began with a promise william kryskill made to his bride, clara: he would build her a castle on a cornfield crest.



 this dream, built with their own hands over seven years, became hyeholde. the original half of the building started in 1931, intended as both a restaurant and living quarters. the couple spent summers operating clark studio tea room in connecticut and returned each fall to work on hyeholde. by 1938, they served their first meals, and it quickly became a success.
