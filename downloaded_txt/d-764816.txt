the charles and helen schwab foundation envisions a world in which all people lead fulfilling and choice-filled lives.



the charles and helen schwab foundation funds solutions in education, housing, and employment that increase economic power and wellbeing in historically marginalized communities. we prioritize innovative approaches that advance racial equity and remove systemic barriers that perpetuate generational cycles of poverty. the foundation has a long history supporting k-12 and higher education, human services, civic and cultural life, and programs serving students with learning differences. in march 2023, the foundation’s board of trustees approved a new strategic plan that focuses on public education nationally and housing and homelessness in the bay area. chsf is a private family foundation and is independent from the charles schwab corporation and from the charles schwab corporate foundation.
