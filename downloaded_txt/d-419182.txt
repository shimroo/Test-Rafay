        does this module control the turn signals or the high beams?

  




  the webelectric products daytime running lights module car part 
controls the turn signal filaments.  in drl mode, both turn signals are on (looks like a late model corvette or camaro).  when you turn on your headlights, the signals go off and operate as normal turn signals.



   what's the difference between 'synchronized' and 'non-synchronized' mode?

  




  the drl-1 module car part 
is set up so that both left and right lamps are synchronized. in other words, when in drl mode, if you turn on a signal, the other lamp turns off. after the signal is complete, both lamps come back on in drl mode. this avoids confusion for an oncoming driver who just glances at your car while you have a signal on. if he looks when the turn signal is in the off cycle, he will see the other lamp on, and may assume you are turning the other way. in synchronized mode, the other lamp turns off, so there is no confusion.you can set up your drl-1 module for non-sychronized mode.  in non-synchronized mode, the opposite lamp will stay in drl mode when a turn signal is in use. this is the way turn signal drls operate on most new automobiles.



   why do the drls (both lamps) randomly turn off and on?

  




  sometimes there is electrical noise on the lighting circuit that is tricking the module into thinking your lights are on, even though they aren't.installing an isolation relay will usually fix this problem.  purchase a relay such as radio shack 12vdc/40a spst automotive relay model: 275-001 or equivalent.  make sure you select a relay designed for continuous use.  then, install the relay as shown in the diagram below.



   can i install the one-touch signals module on any car?

  




  most new cars use a computer to run the turn signals. the turn signal stalk sends a ground input to the computer.  find a wiring diagram of your car, or use a volt meter or test lamp to determine which wires on your car go from the turn signal stalk to the car's lighting computer.  if that signal goes to ground when you move the stalk for right and left turn, then you can install our module and control the number of flashes you get for a one-touch sequence.



   why don't you ship outside the us?

  




  we have too many problems with international orders for car parts. 
 often, there are long delays and orders are lost or damaged.  sometimes, customs will apply a heavy tariff.  all of these problems are out of our control, and can detract from our customers' shopping experience.  rather than risk these disappointments, we decided to stop shipping outside the us.  please don't ask because we won't do it.



   i installed one of your products and my car blew up.  will you buy me a new car?

  




  nope.  our car part 
products are designed to work properly in various vehicles.  however, it is your responsibility to determine suitability for use in your vehicle.  by purchasing one of our products, you are accepting all risks, including but not limited to, physical, financial and emotional risks.  our responsibility is limited to repairing or replacing our product, at our discretion, provided the part has not been abused, mis-treated or mis-applied.



   i want to send you a picture for your customers page, but i don't want you to publish my email address.

  




  no problem.  when you send it, just tell me what you want or don't want.  this is a forum for you to show off your car.  you can fill in the fields as you see fit.



   why do you use paypal?

  




  paypal enables anybody with an email address to securely, conveniently, and cost-effectively send and receive payments online. they have a proven track record for fraud and chargeback protection.  to make payments, you can either use your credit card (though paypal's secure servers) or simply send money from your paypal account.



   what is "smart-sequence"?  can i disable it?

  




   smart-sequence is a new technology for car parts 
that makes your tail lights sequence only when a signal is on.  some states do not allow the brake lights to sequence, even one time.  with smart-sequence, when you hit the brakes, all lamps come on at once.you can disable smart-sequence to make your brake lights sequence once each time you press the brake pedal.  to do this, simply remove the phone cord that connects between the two sequential harnesses.  this will also allow the hazards to sequence each time the flasher clicks on.  (note: check local laws before disabling smart-sequence).



   lifetime warranty

  




  the plain english warranty"if a product fails, send it back and we'll replace it."it's that simple.  if at any time you have a problem with any of your webelectric products items, simply send it back, along with your original sales receipt, and we will repair or replace it, free of charge, as long as you own it.
