medication abortion commonly known as the abortion pill a non-surgical abortion procedure for up to 10 weeks. mifepristone (mifeprex) blocks a hormone called progesterone, causing the pregnancy to stop developing. misoprostol (cytotec) will cause you to pass the pregnancy tissue at home.

we offer 1-day surgical abortion care if you're 5.0 to 16 weeks, and 2-day surgical abortion from 16.1 – 20.6 weeks. depending on your eligibility, you may be awake or asleep for the procedure. misoprostol (cytotec) makes the procedure safer and more effective by dilating and softening the cervix. once dilated the pregnancy will be safely removed.
