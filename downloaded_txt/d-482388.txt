shawn

this was my first visit to stans. everyone was polite and friendly. the only issue was i was unsure if the tires were rotated. the paperwork seems to indicate that tires are rotated âcrossâ. i donât believe they were rotated in my case because the tires were marked. so that makes me wonder if the other inspections were actually completed.
