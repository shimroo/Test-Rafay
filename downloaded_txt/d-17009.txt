entry
                                          point repairs - we specialize in
                                        wildlife that enter the home, usually
                                        living in the attic or walls of a house.
                                        the only way to permanently solve the
                                        problem is to seal up the entry points
                                        by which they can enter. all of our
                                        repairs are of the highest quality and
                                        fully guaranteed against animal
                                        re-entry.

attic
                                          decontamination - wild animals can
                                        contaminate your attic or home - they
                                        can bring in parasites, zoonotic
                                        diseases, debris, fur, and they always
                                        leave behind feces, urine, and other
                                        biohazardous waste. it's often important
                                        to fully clean up and decontaminate the
                                        area after animals have been removed.



 


wildlife
                                          trapping - of course we perform
                                        wildlife trapping. most of the time, we
                                        trap and remove wildlife living inside
                                        homes and attics, but we also trap and
                                        remove nuisance wildlife in all sorts of
                                        situations - from raccoons pooping in
                                        pool to armadillos digging under the
                                        house, to snake removal.

building
                                          inspections - we fully inspect
                                        every square inch of your home to find
                                        those animals, and find out how they are
                                        getting inside. on the roof, in the
                                        attic, under the house. this particular
                                        photo is of me crawling under a house to
                                        remove a dead opossum. no matter how
                                        tough or dirty the job, we will do it

it
                                          takes a dedicated person with a lot of
                                          experience to do the difficult
                                          wildlife removal jobs correctly - when
                                          you have animals in your building or
                                          attic, it's imperative that all the
                                          animals are removed properly, that all
                                          of the damage is repaired, that all of
                                          the entry points into the home are
                                          permanently sealed, and if necessary,
                                          that the attic is properly cleaned.
                                          this is not the type of work for a
                                          regular pest control company. i offer

tip of the month: what is a foothold trap? 

                                ea foothold trap is often used by people who were trying to capture animals that can be quite dangerous. these are frequently used for trapping such things as bears or wolves, because of the successful manner in which it is able to hold the leg or foot of the animal, without causing serious damage to it.



in fact, these are the kinds of traps that are used by those who are looking to capture animals without causing them any kind of serious injury. usually these animals wind up in places like zoos or wildlife refuges, and are employed because one of these wild beasts has shown in a location where it is a risk to human beings that lived there.

there are many instances where people have seen coyotes, wolves, bears, and even lions that have mysteriously shown up in a neighborhood, terrifying the people who live there. no one wants to see these animals hurt, and so what is required is a simple trap that you hold the animal for a period of time until wildlife managers are able to come on the scene, tranquilize the animal, and move it to another location. this is where the foothold trap comes into play.

the way that this trap works is fairly simple, and you may have even seen this before. it is attached to a chain which can either be secured into the soil or into some kind of rock or tree so that it cannot be pulled away.

on the other side of the chain is the trap itself. how it works is that the jaws of the device are open, much like opening the mouth of an animal. in the center of the trap is a trigger mechanism that when stepped on causes the jaws to close. they wrap tightly around the leg of the animal, so that it cannot get out. because the other end of the chain is secured through a rock or tree, the animal is stuck there, and cannot get away.

while the animal may suffer some injury to its leg or foot, the damage that is caused is minimal at best. this has become a great trap for capturing a large variety of animals, even human beings sometimes.

unfortunately, there are many instances where a person accidentally stepped in one of these traps and found the jaws closing on their own foot or leg. while it rarely caused any kind of permanent damage to the person, there is no doubt that it sure hurt like heck.

to release the trap there is a mechanism to decide that is released so that the jaws are not locked anymore and will come open to release the animals or the human beings foot. this is a very effective trap in helping to capture an animal. for those of you who may find that there is a dangerous creature around your property, dont go out and buy this on your own. the truth is that you may be successful but then ask yourself what you will do with the animal afterwards?
