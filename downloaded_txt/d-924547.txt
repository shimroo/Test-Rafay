the state of the union address drinking game 2020
























"he shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."-- u.s. constitution, article ii, section iii



						 

						"madame speaker, the president of the united states..."
the general rules of this game are no different from any other drinking game. a drink is either a shot or a good gulp from a beer (or cider). different events call for different numbers of drinks and all you do is watch the speech and play along. if all goes well, you'll be unconscious by the time they show the other party's response.
