about us

we started “save our beach” because we live along the ocean (it’s literally our backyard) and we would take long walks picking up trash along the way. we were asked many times if we had any extra bags as people would see what we were doing, and they would ask if they could help, too. so, we started carrying extra trash bags on our walks, and then we realized since there was that much interest in people that want to help, we would just make it easier for them by conducting a beach cleanup on a monthly basis. then, we added california coastal cleanup day as a collaborative event.
save our beach was co-founded by steve & kim masoner, on 10/24/1999.




2018 – steve masoner was honored as seal beach’s “citizen of the year” during the annual cypress college americana awards

mission statement


to educate individuals, companies, schools & organizations on how their environmental footprint impacts their community and the world by participating in save our beach beach cleanups and team building activities.








donations


save our beach could not exist without your help. thousands of volunteers picking up trash from our beaches has made quite an impact, but it also takes money to run a non-profit organization. permits, insurance, paper, printing, email/internet service, website design/maintenance, pickers, gloves, bags; all kinds of things just seem to require a bit of cash on hand.
save our beach is happy to receive donations in any amount.
donations can be mailed to:
save our beach ~ po box 1014, seal beach, ca 90740
(or)
made in person at the registration tent at one of our beach cleanups.
we are a non-profit 501(c)3 corporation id# 35-2176382 dedicated to improving
the water quality along the southern california coastline.
