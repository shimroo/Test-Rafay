"to understand kilkenny's unique character one should retire from the busy streets to the lovely castle park and, standing within the shadow of the ancient pile, contemplate the great jumble of roof-tops, old and young, which tumble down to the quiet-flowing river beneath. here dove-grey spires and battlemented towers proclaim a city old in christian living and wise in human experience. one can feel the heartbeat of an ancient civilised community."

katherine m lanigan, gerald tyler, 'kilkenny, its architecture & history', appletree press 1977
