what is encodacam


 general lift provides   an on set real-time virtual set service, using production cranes, dollys and heads. simply stated, our service will allow filmcrews the ability to see all that they will be filming, both foreground and background on a blue or green screen stage using the same dollies, cranes and heads that they use when shooting non-visual effects shots.
