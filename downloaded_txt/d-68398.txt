meet hannah chou 👋🏼 hannah is an entrepreneurship major at tmu, combining her love for small businesses and creativity with a desire to serve the lord. she started her journey at tmu in fall 2023 and, lord willing, plans to graduate in fall 2025.after completing her studies, hannah hopes to work in marketing for a small business — and, if possible, have a flexible and stable career that allows her to return home to hawaii.when asked why she chose tmu, hannah shared:“growing up in and around the tmu community, i’ve always said i wanted to go to school here. however, it was hearing dr. chou (no relation) articulate the mission and aim at tmu, ‘for christ and scripture,’ that convinced me. living ‘for christ and scripture’ is exactly what i want my life to be aimed at. at that point, it became so clear that tmu was the right school.”hannah’s favorite part of tmu is the community and fellowship: “i love the community and fellowship that is cultivated in and out of the classroom. seriously, there is so much to be said for student life here, whether in chapel, the dorms, or all throughout campus.” spiritually, hannah says she has experienced significant growth: “god has been really kind. he has done far more abundantly than all that i could have asked or thought (eph 3), and all i can say is that i love the lord more deeply than i ever have before. he has given me a greater desire to do his will because it is only in his will that i’ll find my greatest joy.” academically, hannah has gained confidence:“as i continue to learn not only about the world around me, but also myself and both my strengths and weaknesses, i become better able to not only see needs around me, but also the ways in which i can contribute and be useful for the sake of others and the gospel.”#lifeattmu
