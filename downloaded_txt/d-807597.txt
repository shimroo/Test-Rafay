welcome to the posada lab
welcome to the posada lab at the university of vigo in galicia, nw spain. our lab typically integrates experimental and computational approaches to investigate the molecular evolution of life at various scales, from the intricacies of populations and species to the dynamics of genomes and cells. we develop cutting-edge analytical methods and user-friendly bioinformatics tools that advance the field of evolutionary biology, applying them to diverse empirical data to shed light on how organisms and cells change and move. we are currently pursuing exciting new avenues in cancer evolution and single-cell genomics, focusing on tumoral dynamics and adaptation. during the covid-19 pandemic, we also contributed to the global effort by analyzing genomic data to monitor the spread of variants in our region and to understand transmission patterns.
