hi. i'm david baum.



for over thirty years i’ve facilitated big conversations that create big change. with two doctorates—the first finding horizontal connections as a social psychologist, and the second looking for vertical ones in divinity, i seek the overlap. my why is always the same. create connection without dots. i partner with exceptional organizations and people and make them better. jane goodall, conde nast, we, the philadelphia flyers, and life is good have all counted on me. projects include conflict mediation in northern ireland, designing walking board meetings in the middle east, and large-scale change projects for shell oil, barclays, ge and fidelity investments. clients have won the nobel peace prize, the conrad hilton humanitarian prize, the world children’s prize, the malcolm baldrige award, and the clinton global citizen award.  finally, i worked in a circus. no one has ever accused me of being boring.















as a conversation architect and consultant, i help clients figure out where they want to go and get them there faster. 



i run best-in-class meetings, that are both energizing and results oriented. whether critical board strategy events, executive alignment team building or large whole system conversations, the combination of creative design, focused questions and not same old same old, gets surprising answers with breakthrough thinking.as a coach, i combine the big questions and honest point of view, if you need a thought partner in driving change. sometimes it’s professional, sometimes personal, but always interesting and based in common sense, depth and meaning.as a keynote speaker, i create memorable messaging with humor, grace and right to the heart story telling. “wow” is the beginning, middle and end result…every time.















creative. original. facilitated conversations flow seamlessly. 



critical discussions ripen with purpose, clarity, and focus. coaching simply works.

listen to david’s interview



with michael nathanson



seeking the extraordinary, a podcast hosted by the colony group’s chair, ceo, and chief inspiration officer michael nathanson, is on a mission to identify, understand, and explore the undiscovered world of the extraordinary. their conversations with guests reveal how their accomplishments, adversities, ideas, and innovations led to extraordinary outcomes. in this episode david and michael discuss some of the adventures he’s had around the world, why he was given the nickname “lemayan” by a maasai warrior in africa, and why creating a “connection without dots” motivates his work as a conversation architect.
