re-released
camouflage 2 fleet carriers

our newly re-printed camouflage 2, which has been out of print for several years is now available in cd format.  this companion to our camouflage 1 (see above) covers the us navy's fleet carriers of ww2.  this book goes into great detail on the dazzle camouflage applied to fleet and light carriers.  camouflage 2 has been expanded and with over 143 photographs!!  each chapter is built around an official usn master design drawing.  each carrier (wearing that specific design) is then shown in numerous photographs, enabling the 
dazzle pattern to be viewed from several different angles.  this includes aerial as well as sea level views.
most photographs have never before been seen.  some are action pictures, and some full page.  some are invaluable close-ups showing structure, radar and rigging details.  additionally, there is a special supplemental chapter.  it updates those schemes (discussed in the first book) of which we have uncovered material.
