aditi and nandha 

aditi jariwala and nandha parthiban’s wedding was a beautiful celebration of love and culture. the couple, both 28, first met in college during a shared class in 2016. their relationship began with casual conversations and grew over time, leading to 7.5 years of dating. during this time, they moved across the country together twice, navigated long-distance periods, and shared many adventures.
the proposal came in december 2022, during a trip to chicago with close friends. after spending the day exploring the city and soaking in the festive atmosphere, nandha surprised aditi with a proposal at a park overlooking the river. aditi was overwhelmed with joy, and the couple spent the rest of the day sharing the news with their families and friends.

for their wedding, aditi and nandha chose the minneapolis institute of art (mia) as the venue, a place close to their hearts. both grew up in minnesota, and although they no longer lived there, their families and many friends were based in the state. they were drawn to mia for its stunning architecture, and they loved that the venue allowed them to bring in food from a local restaurant. their day-of-coordinator, dana from keyed up events, was instrumental in bringing their vision to life, helping them stay organized and managing vendor coordination.
the wedding ceremony was intimate and simple, with the couple opting for a western-style ceremony that reflected their preferences before their traditional hindu wedding in india. aditi’s dress, a custom creation by designer shilpa k. from mumbai, was a beautiful testament to her personal style, while nandha wore a custom suit from suitsupply. the ceremony’s music played a big part in setting the tone, with vitamin string quartet covers creating an elegant atmosphere, and the couple’s recessional song, “stay next to me,” by quinn xcii and chelsea cutler, reflecting their modern tastes.
following the ceremony, the couple hosted a lively reception in another part of the art gallery. the décor was thoughtfully minimal to allow for the food and the art to take center stage. the reception featured a grand fountain at the center of the room, decorated with florals and candles that created a magical atmosphere, especially when the lights were dimmed to reveal the dance floor. the couple chose a mix of their favorite dishes for the dinner, including classic indian appetizers like samosas and sabudana fritters, and main courses such as butter chicken and malai tomatillo with paneer, served family-style. signature cocktails—paloma and spicy moscow mule—were a hit at the open bar. guests also enjoyed a unique touch in the form of custom fortune cookies, a nod to the couple’s first date. the evening was topped off with a stunning dessert display from glam doll donuts, and a custom portrait of the couple painted by aditi’s friend was displayed prominently.
their first dance was to “senorita” from zindagi na milegi dobara, followed by a touching father/daughter and mother/son dance to louis armstrong’s “what a wonderful world.” the energy on the dance floor was electric, with music ranging from bollywood hits to classic pop and hip-hop, reflecting the couple’s diverse cultural backgrounds. the bride and groom danced alongside their loved ones, creating memories that will last a lifetime.
aditi and nandha’s advice for future couples planning their wedding is simple: stay organized and plan ahead. their biggest tip is to hire a wedding planner or coordinator, or to at least make sure you have checklists to avoid last-minute stress. the couple also had a few unexpected moments, like when the power went out at the location where aditi and her bridesmaids were getting ready. thankfully, the team quickly adapted, and the preparation went smoothly, allowing the day to unfold perfectly.
this wedding was a celebration of family, love, and cultural fusion, blending the couple’s indian roots with their personal tastes. from the heartfelt vows to the joyous dance party, aditi and nandha’s wedding was a day they—and their guests—will always remember.
                             

 
roshni and parth 

roshni parikh, a 39-year-old radiologist, and parth worah, a 36-year-old nephrologist, embarked on their beautiful journey of love that culminated in a stunning wedding on may 18, 2024, at the hyatt regency lost pines resort and spa in bastrop, tx. with 250 guests in attendance, the wedding was a grand affair, filled with vibrant celebrations, personal touches, and unforgettable memories. the couple met on hinge in late 2022 after roshni relocated to houston from st. louis, mo. their first date at chuy’s tex mex sparked an instant connection, leading to six months of memorable outings, from axe throwing to attending the houston rodeo. they soon became inseparable, and after meeting each other’s families, it was clear that their bond was meant to be.

 parth’s proposal was nothing short of magical. the couple was in peru for a getaway, where roshni had arranged a photoshoot. what she didn’t know was that parth had planned a surprise proposal during the session. as the sun set over the sacred valley at the rio sagrado hotel, parth proposed with a ring surrounded by rose petals, making it an emotional and perfect moment, captured by the photographer. planning the wedding was made easier with the help of wedding planner rathi menon. her expert coordination allowed the couple to focus on enjoying their day while rathi and her team managed all the details. the couple chose the hyatt regency lost pines resort and spa for its ideal location—just two hours from houston—and the resort’s ability to accommodate a weekend-long celebration with family and friends. the pre-wedding events were a delightful mix of color, culture, and fun. the haldi ceremony, dubbed the “color bash,” featured vibrant hues of hot pink, yellow, and white, with fun games and performances. the sangeet, themed “the dhoom dham mela,” was a colorful celebration of rajasthani and carnival influences, featuring a decorated auto rickshaw and a desi bazaar for guests to enjoy. the wedding ceremony itself was a beautiful outdoor affair, with the bride’s dog, max, making a charming entrance in a miniature motorized white mercedes. the reception, themed “soiree ‘a paris,” was nothing short of glamorous. the ballroom was transformed with red, black, and white décor, featuring a moulin rouge canopy and a black-and-white checkered dance floor. tall white floral arrangements adorned the tables, with personalized touches like red organza potlis filled with chocolates for guests. the reception also featured a love story video that cleverly tied into the couple’s grand entrance. music played a key role throughout the celebrations. the first dance, a medley of songs including ve maahi and shape of you, set the tone for the evening. the father-daughter dance to kudmayi from rocky aur rani ki prem kahaani, and the mother-son dance to chaoro from mary kom, were heartwarming moments that brought tears and smiles to all. the dance floor stayed alive with a blend of bollywood and hollywood hits, making for a truly dynamic celebration. one of the most personal touches was the sangeet performance, where 16 dances by family and friends told the couple’s love story through five themed episodes. from how they met to the proposal, the production was a unique way to narrate their journey. another highlight was the couple’s wedding podcast, which featured three episodes documenting their love story, wedding details, and a thank-you message to their guests. diy projects added a personal flair to the wedding, with the couple creating everything from personalized water bottles and a wedding newspaper to welcome hampers and a desi shopping bazaar. these heartfelt touches made the wedding feel intimate and special for everyone involved. the wedding truly had it all: beautiful décor, heartfelt performances, and personal moments that made it one-of-a-kind. for couples planning their own weddings, roshni and parth’s advice is simple—”enjoy the entire process. the wedding planning process can be stressful, but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience. the weekend will go by so fast, but it will stay with you forever.”                               

 
kelly and vivek 

vivek and kelly’s wedding was a celebration of love, tradition, and beautiful memories, set against the stunning backdrop of the westin carlsbad resort and spa in carlsbad, california. the couple, both dental specialists, had known each other for over a decade before tying the knot on october 29, 2023. their journey began in 2013 during their specialty residency programs at the west los angeles va hospital. despite attending different dental schools, they chose the same 3-year program, and their paths crossed from the very first day. a month into the program, they went on their first date, marking the beginning of a long and fulfilling relationship. for nearly nine years, vivek and kelly nurtured their bond, collaborating both professionally and personally. over the years, they navigated the challenges of long-distance, as vivek worked in san diego for a year before returning to los angeles, while kelly stayed in la. despite working separately, they dreamed of one day collaborating together professionally. in mid-2023, they took a leap and moved to sunny tampa, where they now co-own multiple dental offices.

 vivek proposed to kelly during a trip to mayakoba, playa del carmen, mexico, in june 2022. the surprise proposal was perfectly planned, though kelly had no idea it was coming. vivek had coordinated with the rosewood mayakoba to arrange a proposal spot on the beach, complete with a photographer and family members in the know. as they walked along the beach, kelly noticed a heart drawn in the sand with “v+k” inside. at that moment, vivek dropped to one knee and popped the question, leaving kelly overwhelmed with joy and surprise. the wedding itself was a stunning blend of indian traditions and western customs. it began with a welcome event and mendhi on october 27, 2023, featuring a vibrant color scheme of fall tones, including pinks, salmon, and lavender, complemented by greenery. birdcages, candles, and flowers such as carnations and dahlias decorated the venue. a particularly special touch was the folding of 1,001 origami cranes by their families. this japanese tradition symbolizes peace, love, and longevity, and the cranes were incorporated into both the mendhi and wedding ceremonies, hanging above the sweetheart table during the reception. as the couple transitioned from the mendhi to the wedding itself, they hosted a casual lunch in downtown carlsbad on the day in between, providing a relaxed setting for guests to socialize. the wedding ceremony, held on october 29, was an outdoor hindu ceremony, complete with a traditional baarat. the ceremony was officiated by a priest who ensured that guests, many of whom were unfamiliar with indian wedding traditions, understood the significance of each ritual. the floral decor remained consistent, with the same vibrant colors and flowers from the mendhi, and the mandap was kept simple yet elegant. for the reception, the couple embraced western traditions, with a white wedding ceremony officiated by a close family friend, kent siladi. they re-purposed the flowers from the mandap and continued the crane theme with the 1,001 origami cranes adorning the sweetheart table and the backdrop. a unique touch was the traditional japanese sake ceremony, “san san kudo,” where the couple drank from three stacked cups, symbolizing love, wisdom, and happiness. the evening continued with a series of dances, speeches, and a cake cutting. the couple’s first dance was to “and i love her” by the beatles, a song that held special meaning for kelly, having been a lifelong fan of the legendary band. the day concluded with a night filled with laughter, dancing, and cherished memories, marking the beginning of their new life together.
