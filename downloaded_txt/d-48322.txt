office of financial aid & scholarships










update: the white house budget office has ordered a pause on all federal grants and loans. the temporary pause does not impact "assistance received directly by individuals."  as such, federal student aid funds that are provided to individual students, such as pell grants and direct loans, are not impacted.
 
welcome and thank you for visiting our website
the office of financial aid and scholarships at csusb provides students and their families with information about financial aid resources and facilitates funding in an accurate and timely manner to assist students in pursuing their educational goals.
whether receiving our services and support via telephone or in-person, our mission is to ensure your financial aid experience supports you in completing your college degree or teacher certification within a reasonable time frame and with minimal loan indebtedness.  while federal regulations do require that you and (if dependent) your parents contribute towards your college expenses, as professionals, we focus on your financial needs not covered by your expected family contribution(s) and also based on your meeting aid program eligibility requirements.  we strive to maximize your financial aid awards with grants, scholarships, low-interest student loans with easy repayment terms, and other types of resources. 
by working together and supporting the quality education you receive at csusb, you can stay on track towards completing your undergraduate degree within four years.  please take the time to review our website information designed to ease your transition into college.  feel free to seek our help if you have financial aid questions.  we are here for you throughout the year!
