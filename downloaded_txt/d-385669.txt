aqueduct shutdown
february 22, 2025 – march 4, 2025

reduced supply and use restrictions


for 1-1/2”, 2”, and 3” meters served by valley center municipal water district

the valley center municipal water district (district) has been advised by its wholesale supplier, the san diego county water authority, of the following aqueduct shutdown.  the shutdown of the san diego aqueduct that delivers water to the district will be out of service for rehabilitation repairs and will begin at 1:00 a.m. on saturday, february 22, 2025, through 8:00 p.m. on tuesday, march 4, 2025.  as a result, water flow to the district will be severely restricted beginning saturday, february 22, 2025, at 1:00 a.m. the water that remains in storage will be available only for domestic use and fire protection.

for this period, the district is requesting that customers with 1-1/2”, 2”, and 3” meters refrain from the following water use:
1.  use of water for all agricultural purposes, except for livestock watering
2.  use of water for greenhouse cultivation and indoor propagation
3.  all outdoor landscape/lawn irrigation
4.  all unnecessary use such as filling fountains, pools, spas, or ponds
5.  use of construction water

as a reminder:  turn off all outside irrigation/lawn timers during the shutdown period. domestic water use will be permitted.
unless otherwise notified, normal service will resume tuesday, march 4, 2025, at 8:00 p.m.  please note that the district does not determine the actual shutdown schedule and it may be subject to revision as determined by our wholesale suppliers.  for more information and updates, check the district’s website for more information and daily updates, or call (760) 735-4500 monday through thursday between 7:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. and friday between 7:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. 


the shutdown could cause low water and low-pressure situations which could possibly impact a pump on your property. please take the necessary precautions to prevent any damage from occurring to your pump.
be sure to notify your grove managers and/or irrigators as they will not be notified directly by vcmwd.  
should the district’s water storage levels drop to a point of concern the district will implement the “emergency water management plan”, and you will be notified of further use restrictions which need to be implemented.
your cooperation during the water restrictions is critical and appreciated and will ensure sufficient water availability to meet domestic use and fire protection.

vcmwd fire preparedness
with the wildfires in la, many san diego retail water agencies are getting numerous inquiries regarding the status and preparedness of their respective retail systems to respond to local fire conditions. vcmwd has received one specific request, to which we responded that our system was operating under normal conditions and pressures and was prepared to respond to any fire-related conditions. 


 


though this can change, the lack of inquiry may be related to the fact that the vcmwd water system has a proven record of operating under unusual conditions and circumstances. an example of this was the recent incident where the system was operating during the 1st aqueduct shutdown with several area local public safety power shutoff (psps) events underway. with our long-term investments in storage systems and back-up power resources at our various facilities, the district was able to sustain full domestic and commercial water service, as well as meet some dire or emergency agricultural demands. in the more distant past, the system performed well during the major fires of 2003 and 2007.


 


while we feel confident in our ability to operate under unusual conditions to meet our community's water needs, we remain vigilant to the prospect of a local fire. operating under our red flag protocol for preparedness and using our system-wide visual assets, our system operators can monitor fire-related conditions throughout our service area. if the need arises, our system has the ability to obtain more water from our wholesale supplier, the san diego county water authority (sdcwa), as well as use the district’s internal transmission / pumping capacity to move water to certain areas in response to and coordination with local fire agencies under potential emergency conditions. 


 


we sincerely hope that the areas we serve will be spared any fire-related incidents. however, should this occur, the vcmwd water system is as physically prepared as it is reasonably possible to respond to protect the public and communities we serve.








beware:  phone scams and water utility impersonators
please be aware that individuals may try to impersonate valley center municipal water district staff in person or over the phone. be advised that our staff does not solicit credit card or any personal information by phone. the district will not demand immediate payment of your water bill by credit card over the phone. beware as this is a tactic used by phone scams. if you are unsure whether a call you receive is legitimate, please do not provide any credit card information or personal information.
all of our employees carry a district employee badge, wear a district issued uniform and drive trucks with a district logo so they can be easily identified as valley center municipal water district employees. if you suspect an impersonator is near your home, please call local law enforcement immediately.
to verify the authenticity of anyone claiming to be a representative of valley center municipal water district, customers are encouraged to ask for proper identification or call the office at 760-735-4500.












📢 important update 📢
in an effort to reduce costs and promote sustainability, we will no longer be mailing paper copies of your annual backflow test report.


what does this mean for you? 
you can request a copy of your backflow test report anytime by contacting the district office.
if you still prefer to receive a paper copy of your report annually, please call the district office at (760) 735-4500, and we will be happy to accommodate your request.


we appreciate your understanding as we work to keep costs down while providing you with the best service possible. thank you for being a valued customer of vcmwd!
