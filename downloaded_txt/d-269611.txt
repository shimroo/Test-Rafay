virginian railway:

the virginian railway stretched from norfolk, va, to deep water, wv, a little over 500 miles, making it the smallest class 1 railroad in the country.  i'm particularly fascinated by the electric zone, which ran from roanoke, va, to mullins, wv.  my extensive line is intended to make it easy for you to recreate, in miniature, the virginian railway.

clinic
and event schedule:

a while back model railroader
discontinued their free event listing, replacing it with a priced event
listing.  meanwhile, we went to managing our calendar with google
calendars, much more convenient than html editing..  great decals!
has thus expanded the scope of our calendar to include events we hear about. 
so unless a table or clinic is specifically mentioned, don't assume we'll
be there.  contact us first to confirm.  thanks.
