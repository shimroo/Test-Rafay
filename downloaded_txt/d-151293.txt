this is cutting it close





i've been writing for dtlax magazine, a quarterly magazine for/about downtown los angeles, published by my friend bert green (longtime downtown resident, director of the bert green fine art, and founder of the wildly successful downtown art walk).  my latest, titled, "peeing in public" can be found on p13 of the winter issue and "i can see the streets from where i am now" is on p16  of the summer issue. i bring this up because the next issue will be going to press soon and i have to turn in 600 words by tomorrow. and so far, i have nothing.  nothing.

unpublished blog posts





a friend once told me that my best stories were the ones i didn't blog about. although i never published those stories, they are written. and it's almost a novel. which could then be adapted into a screenplay. i just wonder if it's dramatic/comedic/cinematic/interesting enough to warrant that kind of effort/attention.

i've been writing





i received some great news last month - i was named a film independent project:involve screenwriting fellow, class of 2010. you probably already know film independent (find) as the fine folks who bring you the independent spirit awards and the los angeles film festival, this is one of their talent development programs. from their website:project:involve is film independent's signature diversity program, dedicated to increasing cultural diversity in the film industry by cultivating the careers of under-represented filmmakers. the program, which runs from october through june, selects filmmakers from culturally diverse backgrounds and filmmaking tracks. the fellows are paired one-on-one with a mentor from the film industry. in addition to the mentorship, the fellows also attend filmmaking workshops, community screenings, and receive career development assistance.since my orientation is scheduled for later today, i guess today is the first official day of my fellowship. tomorrow, i meet and mingle with the rest of the find staff, the p:i class of 2009, and my class at a reception. friday, i'm doing this thing at universal. additionally, i've optioned a screenplay i'd like to produce and i'm waiting to hear whether i made it into the find producers lab. in addition to whatever mentorship find arranges, i'll resume weekly meetings with bigshot producer (my producing mentor) starting next week. this may be the last you hear of me for a couple of months, but i am hoping that i'll blog more often and chronicle all the wackiness that will likely ensue.

a drink at cole's





i joined blogdowntown's eric richardson and central city east's don garza at cole's last week for the first blogdowntown pub crawl. while waiting for a sandwich, i enjoyed a sazerac and shot some video footage on the nokia 6650 for the nokia chronicles.

need to get off of santa's naughty list?





i received this email from darrell miho (my wedding photographer and old college friend) and i thought the readers of this blog might want to help him help the asian pacific women's center:... the asian pacific women's center would like to have a dvd player for each of the units in their shelter.  i am going to go buy 6 of them at best buy for $43.29 each.  if you would like to donate 1 please let me know and send me your address so that i can include you as a donor and apwc can send you a receipt.  this donation is tax deductible.for those of you who don't know, the asian pacific women's center (apwc, tax deductible id: 93-1102854) is dedicated to providing a safe haven and support services for women and children who are survivors of domestic violence. their mission is to provide an environment that is sensitive to the cultural and language needs of asian and pacific islander domestic violence survivors and their families, as they acquire the necessary skills and personal strength for self-sufficiency and violence-free lives.  as one of their many volunteers, i have seen first hand the wonderful work apwc does for their residents.  the shelter is a beautiful place where the residents can feel safe as they move forward to provide themselves with a happy and violence-free home.  for more info, please visit their website at:  http://www.apwcla.org/to see other items on their wishlists, please visit:  http://www.apwcla.org/donations/index.htmlthank you for any help you can provide apwc and their residents.  i probably need a lot more bonus points to get off the naughty list, but this should help.  =)take care and happy holidays!     *    joy   love  peace      !may every day be christmasdarrell miho626.975.6349http://www.darrellmiho.comhttp://darrellmiho.blogspot.comhttp://www.thegarrettmihofoundation.orgi pointed out that they might need dvds for the players, so he's taking donations of used or new dvds as well (g or pg rating, please).  jim and i will be donating $ for a dvd player and some dvds, please join us and help support a worthy cause.
