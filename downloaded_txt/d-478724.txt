8 teeny anti-bummers, because the coup of cruelty


 
 


 
 

hi darling ones, how’re your hearts and brains holding up while we continue to live through these cruel unprecedented times? mine’s okay, mostly because i was able to sleep a bunch last night and i’m doing a pretty good job of staying out of the doom spiral. since i’m in a decent mood, i thought i’d share some anti-bummers with you. there’s mrs. meyer’s lilac-scented soap in the downstairs bathroom and dandelion-scented soap in the kitchen and so whenever i…

hi darling ones, well, january, all 473 days of it, has been a trip, hasn’t it? m how are you doing trying to hold on to your humanity and protect your heart in these ever crueler times? it’s hard out here for a human, ain’t it? one of the things i never thought about in all my history classes (which were crappy, because white supremacy and us education) were people’s daily lives and how hard it must have been to…

this week


 
 


 
 

hi darling ones, even before the fascists regained control of our country (which wasn’t so hot before), i vowed i would spend 2025 noticing and celebrating happiness. this is a project i’ve been half-assedly attempting since the triple whammy of my dad’s death, the stroke, and the end of my 24-year friendship with bfk all in the span of 11 months. i had, and have, a lot of reasons to wallow in woe is me. to be fair, after this…

judgements, traumas, strokes & sticky buns


 
 


 
 

dear darling ones, i’ve been thinking a lot about trauma lately. this might come as a total surprise as i’m such a magnanimous, even-keeled, generous spirit, but i can be pretty judgmental. thankfully, i’ve matured enough to (mostly) go ahead and shut the fuck up about most of my judgements. because, who and i to judge, and most of the things i like to judge are none of my damn business. nobody cares that i get the icks from attractive…

plateaus can blow me


 
 


 
 

hi darling ones, some days i am not in the mood to hear how lucky and fortunate i am. being the chirpy, very special episode guest star sucks and sometimes i don’t want to play the role. yesterday at the neurologist’s office i couldn’t fake it. hot on the heels of the disability denial, i was not having any of dr. s’s a++s and gold stars. i did not want to hear how excellently i’m doing. how i’m doing all…

denied


 
 


 
 

hi darling ones, i hope you all made it into 2025 relatively unscathed. i had a quiet, peaceful start to the new year until yesterday delivered the first kick in the teeth of the year. social security denied my disability claim. they seem to think the ability to clearly see letters, punctuation, lines, and shapes are not important to my work as a writer and web designer. they acknowledge it may be more difficult, but doesn’t inhibit my ability to…

hi darling ones, one more day. we can do it! here’s three things i wanted to mention before the year ended. a crowded house as is tradition, i hosted rock & roll bookclub dirty santa on the 28th and it was most excellent. my college-era friend ray came from madison and at one point he, sister #2, and wolfdogg were chatting in the dining room. ben & max were preparing dinner in the kitchen, hannah & jaycie were on the…

lesions of doom


 
 


 
 

hola queridas, in this house we mostly use the feminine form of spanish words. how have you been? i’ve been busier than a one-legged woman at an ass-kicking contest (one of my favorite corny aphorisms). i got a new microwave and dishwasher and then i had to get my new dishwasher fixed. then i also had a bunch of work to do, enough to pay my mortgage in january. yay! mostly, i’ve been working my floppy scoop and tremory fingers…

baby, we’re the same


 
 


 
 

dear darling ones, matthew sweet updated his gofundme, and much like he has for the last 30+ years of my life he is expressing my feelings in ways i cannot. he said about his stroke: as i learned to walk, bathe, strengthen my legs, learn what hard work really was, i cried many times at my terrible fate and yet i also was so thankful for the fate i had in life, because it was a wonderful fate, and i…

hi darling ones, as you now, i’ve struggled through november. it’s rough. when people ask me how stroke recovery us going i say, “it’s difficult (or annoying or frustrating or a pain in my ass), but i’m lucky i got to be annoyed/frustrated, etc. i could have died!” in my deep-dark, icy-robot heat i’m shouting “this is total crap. no fair!” and also, my old standby “why can’t anything ever be easy.” empotionallly, things are getting a little bit better…
