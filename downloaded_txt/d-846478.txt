greetings from the sanderson bandthe sanderson band has a long history of excellence, dating back to the school's opening in 1968. currently, the sanderson band program consists of the marching spartans, wind ensemble, concert band, and various other small ensembles, as well as annual performances with the sanderson theater department in the spring musical. the band has performed extensively across north carolina and the southeastern united states in both marching band competitions and concert band festivals. each year many sanderson band students are selected for all-district, all-state, and governor's school, and many alumni are pursuing music degrees at some of the country's finest universities.
