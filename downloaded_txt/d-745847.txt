new reviews
are you hungry for a good costume drama? me too! i hunt 
						long and hard to find new ones to watch, and here's the 
						latest: 
						nosferatu is a gorgeous, rich costume drama 
						with just one flaw: its theology.
						
all creatures great & small's fifth season 
						is on pbs. 
						gladiator ii is "meh," and 
mary 
						is a weird biblical retelling.
