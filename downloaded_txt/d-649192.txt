    more about laura
  

 


“laura is not so much a dog trainer as a miracle worker. in record time, our three “hopeless” dogs were putty in her hands. from curbing excessive barking to teaching our nervous and jittery rescue dog how to use the stairs, no job was too big or too small. i don’t so much recommend her as wonder how anyone could get along without her.”

— dana gould, writer, "the simpsons"
