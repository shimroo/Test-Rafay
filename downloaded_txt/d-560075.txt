welcome to rum pointe




this scottish-style links is the only area course to feature bent-grass on the fairways and greens. no less than 17 of the 18 holes have a bay view with several holes having direct bay frontage, where you can start your ball over the water to shorten the hole. the dyes have certainly created situations of risk and reward that will quicken the heart rate of even the most experienced golfer. from the back tees this championship quality course is capable of hosting a pga tour stop but forgiving enough from the middle tees to satisfy golfers of all skill levels.
par 72, 18 hole championship course
17 holes have a direct bay view
now available: pro-link gps system
in-cart electronic yardage system; provides yardages from your ball to the pin
