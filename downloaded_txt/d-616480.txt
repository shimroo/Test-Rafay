sharing the love of roses
 morden blush
welcome to the canadian rose society!!

do you love roses in all their forms?
are you a new gardener interested in adding a rose bush or two to your garden?
are you an experienced rose gardener who wants to increase your knowledge or keep up to date with new developments?
is making a connection with other rose gardeners across the country important to you?

we are a group of people who share our love and appreciation of the rose throughout canada via education and friendship.
our members receive a monthly electronic newsletter, have access to educational programs featuring guest speakers via zoom, and have the opportunity to build friendships with other rose growers across canada. as we love to talk roses we welcome your questions  or the opportunity to hear about your rose growing experiences.
all gardeners, both new or experienced are welcome to join our society and become part of the canadian rose growing community.
