periodontal care in pittsburgh – restore your gum health
periodontal care focuses on the health of your gums, which are the main supporting structures of your teeth. gum health directly impacts the longevity of your teeth and can even affect your overall health. periodontal services address issues such as gum disease, gum recession, and dental implant placement.
gum disease treatment: gum disease, also known as periodontal disease, can lead to gum inflammation, bleeding, decay, and even tooth loss if untreated. we offer periodontal treatments to restore your gum health and prevent further damage from developing.
gum recession treatment: receding gums can expose tooth roots, making teeth more sensitive, even painful, and leave them vulnerable to decay. we offer gum grafting to correct gum recession, protecting tooth roots and restoring the beauty of your smile.
periodontal maintenance: after undergoing periodontal treatment, preventing gum disease reoccurrence becomes the priority. with ongoing periodontal therapy, we will work with you to maintain your gum health and ensure the longevity of your natural teeth, and dental implants.
your gum health is essential for a beautiful smile and a healthy life. if you’re in need of expert periodontal care, pinnacle center is here to help. contact us to schedule an appointment today. we look forward to meeting you!
