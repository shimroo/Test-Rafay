chuck varga, one of the founders of the slave pit, has a new website available. the website is more of an online resume but also provides interesting information about the man known as sexicutioner on-stage. chuck brought a lot of talent and entertainment to slave pit inc. and gwar and now resides in nyc where he works as a special effects technician. 
bobgorman.com is up and running 
bob gorman's new website is now online. it's been sitting idle for quite a while but bob is a busy guy of course, which is prevalent by the plethora of items displayed on his website. bob shows off his work on bicycles, mopar toys, illustrations, as well as a couple infamous gwar props.

bob gorman is interviewed in a well done pop-culture style 
                    mag based in richmond, va, called chew 
                    on this. bob offers some thoughts on his role in gwar 
                    and the editors offer some thought provoking photos of cute 
                    women with scary monsters. all-in-all an interesting 3-page 
                    read for those with a short attention span.

 "we argue a bit but what it comes 
                    down to ultimately is a compromise. everything is a compromise; 
                    even working at mcdonalds there are compromises. this is less 
                    of a compromise. ive done plenty of other jobs outside of 
                    gwar, but i keep coming back because its how people know 
                    me. when people see my art, they know it because theyve seen 
                    it in concert, on t-shirts, and in comic books. its the coolest 
                    thing ive done and im very aware of that. i love it."
if you're local to richmond feel free to snag a copy, or 
                    for the non-local and computer savvy there is an adobe acrobat 
                    version

                    (34 kb .sit) available for download from their website.
