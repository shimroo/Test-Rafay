 are you someone who doesn't like to buy a whole 
              cd but rather download tracks as you find them available? all the 
              cd's i've released from 2003-2013 are now available for download 
              by individual tracks on itunes, amazon, spotify and google play 
              for $.99 each!!! this includes my #1 single "it's all good" and 
              many other favorites such as "when jesus rides on the clouds".
