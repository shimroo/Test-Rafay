      questions others are asking.
  










what is the difference between a degree, diploma, and certificate?








we offer several credentials that provide the flexibility you need. most degree programs last two years and provide the most in-depth study of a particular subject. diplomas and certificates take less time and are often taken in conjunction with other degree programs. specialized training is also available for workforce development programs that are completed in less than a year. 
always check with your advisor for details. not all programs provide college credit or are transferrable.

we have parking lots designated for visitor parking on each campus. visit our campus locations page to learn more and view campus maps. visitors do not need a parking pass.
