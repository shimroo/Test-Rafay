mad men





men.  what to do with them? as soon as my old boss at the hotel found out i got a new job, he wanted me back. madness. i guess thats just how the male sex rolls, as soon as they can't have something they want it back.  but that's okay with me.  after a week or so at the finish line, i was having terrible panic attacks and i realized that the job wasn't for me, not now, in my recovery.  i've been switching medications like a drug addict to get myself back to normal.  i have so many pill bottles i feel like an elderly person.  and in light of that, i just couldn't continue with the job, plus....i got my old job back!

up and down





yesterday was up and down.  i started a new job, because my old boss at the hotel was dragging his feet and i couldn't wait any longer for cash flow.  i started to panic, and put feelers out into the employment world and got some applications, etc.  an old friend of mine, robbie, just started her own marketing business after leaving the ministry to focus on her family, so being such close friends, i called her to pray with me about my situation... and she told me she had a job for me!  a client of hers, owner of a local business called the finish line sports sub shop had hired her because he needed a new manager and pretty much all new employees due to mismanagement by the old gm and crew.  in a matter of a few text messages i had an interview the next morning at 10am.  needless to say, i got the job, and am being considered as the main candidate for general manager!it's a salary position, which would be my first.  starts at 26k/year, and although that may not sound like much, it's still over twice as much as i've ever made per year, even with 3 jobs!  this is an amazing opportunity for me, and i am so excited.  many people would see going from a hotel to food service as a downgrade, but food service is so fun.  however, so was my old job at the hotel.i did my orientation at work yesterday for about 2 hours and learned the basics and had a great time.  my new boss and i really hit it off.  but then i got home, and it hit me, i'm not going back to work at the hotel.  i had just counted on it, and i loved that job.  loved the job, loved the guests, loved the staff, loved my boss.  and it's gone now.  all gone.  i only have myself and my illness to blame.everyone thinks i'm crazy because the finish line affords a much larger opportunity (indeed, a life-changing opportunity) but it still hurts when you lose something you love, and it's still scary to start a new job, especially one with potentially more responsibility and stress.  i will miss the holiday inn express so much, but hopefully the new job will be everything it promises to be.wow i just talked to my new boss and he was so impressed with me in the 2 hours i worked yesterday that he put me on the schedule for 30 hours instead of the agreed-upon 15 to be orientated.  in addition, he's going out of town for a couple days and leaving the store with me.  i am really excited but nervous, but more excited.  it's looking more and more like management!

colorful colorado





it was like 57 degrees out and sunny, and when we finally got to copper mountain we saw the snow, beautiful champagne powder as far as the eye could see. i had missed it so!hot chocolate with a shot of vanilla vodka :)                                                                                  on the slopes with danielle at copper mountain.skiing was a dream.  amazing conditions and warm so that you could even wear your jacket open.  i hadn't skied in ten years so i was very nervous, but it's just as they say, as soon as i put my skis on it was like getting on a bike!danielle had a meeting at her work in the cherry creek area of downtown denver (a quite trendy part of town) so i hung out there waiting for her meeting to be over.it just so happened that an old friend of mine from high school, jennifer, lives only a couple blocks away from the bar i was hanging out in and we got to catch up.  small world!we took a trip to boulder, a quaint college town, and had a our picture taken in (a) boulder.my favorite picture from the entire week!

tragic but true





the time that i've wasted is my biggest regret;stuck in this place i will never forget.memories of past times always stay near;but vanquished by this waking nightmare.i lie awake at night while others sleep;a stream of pictures swarm my mind with each heartbeat.i await the day i can be with my love;praying incessantly to the heavens above.until then i must lie in this blistering hell;confined due to my very own will.hear me now, lost souls, heed my words;don't allow the darkness to overpower your urge.we are all on this path, sometimes tragic, always true;but if you stop looking down, the whole world awaits you!
