 one of a kind, always the best.



    bringing new life to traditional real estate
 
at metrovation, we're passionate about creating unique properties that bring new life and energy to communities. with over 25 years of experience in the industry, we've become experts at revitalizing neighborhoods and transforming underutilized areas into thriving communities. metrovation employs unconventional strategies built on a blend of instinct and experience.our philosophywe believe that every project deserves a fresh perspective and the opportunity to add value to the environment. that's why we take a location-driven approach to our developments, combining it with hands-on management and leasing. our goal is to create a perfect mix of tenants that will achieve long-term stability, value, and adaptability to market conditions.from retail to office and mixed-use developments, we're dedicated to making places vital. our properties, such as hotel san luis obispo, downtown red bank, and the oakland ironworks district, are known for their energy, creativity, and ability to stimulate growth while remaining true to the character of the communities in which they are located. our legacymetrovation has roots dating back to over 40 years of success, as the successor to terranomics development. we have developed or redeveloped over 3 million square feet of properties and currently hold around 2 million square feet of retail, office, hospitality, and multifamily properties. with long-term investments and tenants, we are committed to nurturing our buildings and relationships. our goal is simple: to make places vital. with a slightly unorthodox approach and a commitment to originality, metrovation is leading the way in specialty real estate development. our mission is to stimulate growing communities where we feel we can make a difference.
