if you don't take care of your health, who will?

perhaps... doctors, nurses and undertakers will take care of you; but, their kind of care isn't the best option.
we advocate a less common way - the road less traveled, so to speak â namely, a lifestyle of self-directed endeavoring to maintain optimally functioning mitochondria, organelles, cells, tissues, and body systems.
this superior way of living calls for simple daily habits geared toward eliminating toxicities and deficiencies from your body.
this healthier and happier path also includes making time for critically important rejuvenating of tissues, organelles and organs.

nothing is more devastating to the enjoyment of life than the loss of one's health... and yet most people don't take well enough care of themselves. instead, most people delegate their personal health supervision to the bigs â big pharma, big business and big social government.
to assist you in going on a better and more rewarding path, we teach what works in the arena of health promoting practices and we continually search the world for and bring to you the most effective, detoxifying, nourishing and restoring products.

the health roads most and least traveled
the road traveled by the majority of americans is to ignore health maintenance and trust to luck, medical doctors and medical interventions when health problems inevitably occur instead of the wiser way of learning how and choosing to maintain their bodies with nutrition and detoxification.
in regard to cars, a similar method for car maintenance would be skipping oil changes, engine tune-ups, tire rotations, etc. and only paying attention to your car when a problem happens. not taking care of their magnificent bodies is why americans spend the last 14% to 28% of their lives with an exceedingly poor quality of health.
there is another path.

it is the one less traveled by â the road of enlightened people who learn the five habits of health and learn how to ensure that their bodies receive significant amounts of a broad range of nutrients and are frequently cleaned of toxic elements that otherwise would accumulate.
this is the road of optimum health and optimum opportunity for joy.
so, if youâre on the other road, we suggest that you back up fast!

the golden retirement years should be active joyful years, not poor health years!




the curse causeless shall not come




there is a reason why the nation of switzerland has the best health statistics of any industrialized nation and why the united states has nearly the worst, despite spending more on health care than any other nation. that reason is that the swiss people eat much more nutritiously. the swiss are famous for precision watches and eating at home meals made from fresh ingredients (i.e., not eating empty calorie, fast food). 
americans are famous for fast food. americans primarily eat nutrient empty food — characterized by too much sugar, carbs, salt, adulterated fats and food preservatives.






the key to a long healthy life is
getting more nutrition and
detoxifying the body constantly
 



if you want to still be young at 85 years of age then you have to eat nutrient-dense food and detoxify daily!





you need to improve your health habits now
you will lose from 2 to 7 days of potential lifespan or high quality of life for each month that you delay adopting the best health habits (depending on how bad your current health habits are).

if you have lived your first 40 years with less than optimal health habits you have already lost from 2.6 to 9.2 years of life/optimal quality of life.
during your next 40 years, if you still fail to improve your health habits, you will lose even more potential life/optimal quality of life, from 3.9 to 13.8 more lost years.

cumulatively, that's as much as 23 years of potential life/optimal quality of life that you can easily lose by not having optimal health habits. can you imagine how much you would pay to get even half of those years back at the end of your life (once you realize your health is in serious trouble)? don't you think that really enjoying those 6.5 to 23 "golden" years (the years after retirement without the pressures of work) would be worth learning and implementing the five habits of health? especially when these habits are really quite simple and easy.
there is no time like today to begin making the rest of your life the best it can be!








two roads...
"two roads diverged in the woods and i took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference in the world!" — robert frost.







the end of the standard american diet road is:

diabetes
heart disease
cancer
arthritis
alzheimer's
parkinson's
overweight
no energy to play
shortened life







 
 







the end of the healthy living road is:

feeling good
less likelihood of disease
more energy
longer life
opportunity to play with great-grand kids
zest for life








please choose the road less traveled. subscribe to our healthy-living newsletter and learn the truths about how to be healthy!.



maintenance is better than repair. and with the human body, repair isn't always possible.
