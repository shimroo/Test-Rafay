welcome to simgalaxy.com, home of the franchise sports online sports simulation games.
welcome to simgalaxy.com's new server!  this is the home of the franchise sports simulation games.  there are currently three simulation sports games playing year round.  franchise football (american rules football), franchise basketball (a professional basketball sim game), and franchise baseball (an online baseball simulation game).
what is a sports simulation?
a sports simulation game is a game where users take control of a professional sports franchise (in this case, a basketball, football or baseball team).  unlike fantasy basketball, fantasy football or fantasy baseball, you don't rely on real life players in the national football league (nfl), major league baseball (mlb) or national basketball league (nba) to play games and create statistics.  you have a 100% fictional roster of players in this simulation game.  those players actually take to the court each night in simulated games against other user controlled franchises.  based on the player ability scores (which you can influence through many options in the game) your team performs in a certain way, either winning or losing.  no longer do you have to guess if a basketball player will start, or if a football player is going to be healthy.  you make the call!  but that is not all.

in addition to making roster decisions in these online games, you are also in control of the business end of your franchise.  somehow you must make money in order to improve your team.  that is where the front office comes into play.  you need to guide your football, baseball or basketball team to financial health through the purchase of merchandise and concession contracts, advertising, ticket sales and more.

these sports simulation games truly put you in control of all facets of a pro football franchise, a pro basketball franchise or a professional baseball franchise.

the franchise basketball simulation game.
it is not fantasy basketball, it is franchise basketball.  unlike playing fantasy basketball, as we have mentioned, franchise basketball doesn't rely on professional players and the pitfalls of building your team around someone else's decisions.  here in this basketball simulation game, you decide who is going to play, you upkeep the front office, and you even make basketball strategy decisions with your bench section.  in the bench you can take this basketball simulator in the direction you want.  you think your opponent has a weak front court?  exploit it.  do you think that your basketball team can light it up from outside?  well, nurture that.  in fantasy basketball you have absolutely no control over the way your team performs on the court.  here, you can experiment with things to attempt to streamline your team.  you can even customize your players through training.  that definitely isn't fantasy basketball.  in fact, no fantasy sports game offers this kind of customization and control.  you can't get that from fantasy baseball or fantasy hockey, either.  best of all, you can try out the game totally free.  test it out, see if you like it.  we think you will agree, this is the best basketball simulation game on the web.



the franchise football simulation game.
as the basketball game says, it's not fantasy sports, it is franchise sports.  franchise football is no different.  in many respects it brings all the best elements of the basketball simulation game to a football simulation.  you still have all the control over your football team.  you can influence the football simulator by training players, signing free agents, and cutting blockbuster trades with other owners in the game.  again, unlike fantasy football, you have the maximum control over your franchise.  in fantasy football you can't decide what offenses and defenses you are going to play.  here you can.  in fantasy football, you are at the whim of the league playing games once per week, here you aren't.  in fantasy football, you have to suffer through a grueling off-season with no games being played, here you don't.  most football leagues here on simgalaxy run simulation games 12 months of the year, no off-season!  in addition, unlike fantasy football, here, games are played twice per week rather than once!  so, twice the action in this football simulation!
what the future holds for the simgalaxy family of simulation games.
the future is bright here at simgalaxy.  not only are there currently three simulation games up and running full throttle (baseball, basketball and football) but, we are planning several other games.  obviously these games will follow the formula laid out in the first two sports simulation games, but, they will also feature new options that are not in the other simulation games.
