futura™ design tool
futura™ wall panels by smith&fong applies the use of compositional geometric figures, each part of which has the same proportional character as the whole. exciting and interpretive, this expressive carved panel series uses the discipline of isosceles triangles to create squares and nested geometric shapes. the result is an expression of infinite space by emphasizing line, color and light. the visual complexity of the futura compositions causes the eye to find forms beyond the geometry evoking ideas, events and emotions.
