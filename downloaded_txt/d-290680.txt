the historical record, as
represented by the german government at the time, on bromberg
"bloody sunday" and related incidents -- 58,000 claimed dead or missing by feb
1940.  the german invasion was sep 1939, but it's important to understand
that many of the outrages had preceded the german invasion.  this
was proved by the amount of decomposition of the bodies.  thus, these
atrocities cannot be excused simply as reprisals for the german invasion (which
would be wrong anyway).  they
included 19 year-old girls with their faces smashed, amputations, disembowelments,
shot thru' the eye, death-trauma births, you name it.  poles had been merrily slaughtering
anything or anybody german since at least as early as april 1939, with smaller
incidents stretching back to the close of ww i  -- you haven't been told that by the
mass media, or the fact that these atrocities were one of the main causes for
the german invasion of poland, something that was meant by the germans to be a
local solution to a local problem.

statement of purpose.
this site's purpose is to
bring to the fore many old works of literature you may not be aware of. 
certainly, if you grew up in the past 50 years, went through an
"establishment" education and did what you were told, chances are you
were never allowed to examine the works presented herein.
these books and essays all
deal in some way with white solidarity and white nationalism.  if mentioned
at all (e.g., in a classroom or rag-mag article), these books had short
passages quoted out of context to make the authors appear ridiculous, and then it
was "on to the next subject".  haven't you ever wondered why they never
showed you the whole thing, so that you could decide for yourself?
many deal with specially
coddled "minorities" or uniquely powerful "religious groups"
that have legions of brainwashed lackeys at-the-ready to protect them from all
criticism.
the establishment has taken
great pains to ensure that you never look at these books, articles and essays.  many old books
disappear off library shelves, conveniently "lost" or
"misplaced".  some are bought out for the sole purpose of
destruction.  many are now quite rare.  a few titles can be seen in
your local bookstore -- but  invariably the text
is altered in some way.  they are presented here as an
act of preservation, and in defiance of "political correctness".
so now, reaching down into
the memory hole . . .

 "which
way am i spinning?" -- debunking the nazi "backwards swastika"
myth -  we've all heard it: "hitler turned
the swastika backwards to make it a symbol of evil so he could perpetrate
world conquest".  i've done a little research, and found that there is
nothing to the claim -- in fact, the claim is diametrically opposed to the truth
as experts (real ones) understood it prior to ww ii.  the nazi swastika is

	easily replaced than wealth (i'm not kidding  read it).

dietrich

	pens of british writers.


hermann rauschning -

world war i and general 
time period:


the
belgian people's war -  poles and jews aren't the only world's
professional victims.  the belgians made a good stab at this theme during
ww i, and got the ball rolling on the "germans are evil and trying to take
over the world" canard.  take a look at the german perspective on
these far-reaching events.



the neutrality of belgium - 
	more woe from the world war 
	sweepstakes.  treats of germany and the question of the "sacredness" of 
	belgian neutralitynot so sacred after all, as the author proves.

    the tragedy of hungary.  read and weep.  the ww i, treaty
    of versailles fiasco from a non-german perspective.  also, info on the

	"protocols of the learned elders of zion", using it as a springboard for all 
	the major topics, these articles, originally published in ford's the 
	dearborn independent, are classic studies into this consummate problem.  
	this material was re-published by ford in book form in 4 volumes, 1920-22.

sir

many
    suppressed and hidden works of the great explorer, linguist and

    condition that does not and never did exist.  lots of ethno-info on
    blacks, jews, indians and gypsies.  the ultra-rare stone talk 
	and bayonet exercise are also here.

a little humor
    -  "mr. wonderful"  
    [ html version ], that
chubby-legged government guy waddling to work (so he shouldn't be late!) that we
all know and love [this screed dates to around 1968]; "map"
of canada and the us in 2092.  it's probably nowhere near radical
enough for what's really coming; bogus  "r. reagan writes to j.
    hinckley"; these  hardware standards will come in handy as we move to an
    ever more "diverse" workforce.

          a few interesting links.
