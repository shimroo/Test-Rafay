when meeting with your advisor:

come with a list of questions you want to ask. try to be as specific as possible.
look up academic dates and deadlines that relate to your questions.
tell your advisor as much as you can about why you're meeting with them. the more they know about your situation, the more they can help you.
your meeting is held in confidence, so prepare to engage in a discussion beyond course choice and program options.
