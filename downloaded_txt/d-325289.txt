          welcome to holler honda
honda is one of the leading manufacturers of reliable and stylish vehicles. this global brand is known for its sporty models and innovative design elements, as well as efficient and powerful options for every buyer. at holler honda, we can help you get behind the wheel of your dream honda. we carry a wide selection of new and pre-owned models and our location is easily accessible for those throughout orlando, florida, and the nearby cities of winter park, altamonte springs, longwood, and oviedo. 


shopping at holler honda
we strive to provide a positive experience to every customer who visits our location. in order to achieve this goal, we offer the “buy smart – be happy” guarantee, which is something that sets us apart from other dealerships. if the thought of haggling for a better price on a vehicle causes you anxiety, you'll be happy to know that this policy includes our best price first. every car, truck, and suv available has its best price clearly marked, saving you time and money by eliminating the negotiation process.
our salespeople don't work on commission, which means they have no reason to pressure you into a purchase. by taking the commission out of the equation, our salespeople are free to work with you to accommodate your needs, answer your questions, and help you find the right car for your lifestyle. if you buy a car and find that it's not quite the right fit, return it within five days or 300 miles for a full refund or exchange it for another model. plus, as part of the holler-classic family of dealerships we have access to a wide range of inventory, including our sister honda orlando store.


new and pre-owned selection
at holler honda, you'll find a large selection of both new and pre-owned vehicles. if you're considering a pre-owned model, many of the options we have come with a free 90-day limited warranty. you don't have to worry about paying for tires, brakes, bulbs, or a battery within the first 90 days of ownership, and this warranty doesn't have any mileage restrictions.
if you're looking at the latest models in the honda lineup, we can help you find the perfect new car, truck, or suv that meets your needs and exceeds your expectations. some of our top-selling sedans include the civic, a stylish and sporty model that is available with high-end performance features, and the accord, a midsize vehicle that boasts a spacious cabin and the latest safety features. buyers also love the cr-v, hr-v, and pilot, which are crossover suv options in the lineup that come standard with plenty of luxurious features. 


trade-in and financing options
if you're planning to trade in a vehicle, we'll give you an appraisal with a written offer to purchase that is good for seven days or 300 miles, whether you buy a car from us or not. we also have a team of financial professionals who can assist with financing needs and help you qualify for terms that fit within your budget.
holler honda is a great place to buy a car, but that's not all we offer to our clients. we can also take care of your honda to keep it running smoothly. our service department includes honda certified technicians who can tackle a range of maintenance and repair services, available at competitive prices. visit us today to experience the difference in the car buying experience.
