i was a big bad







sorry bee. i am so sorry.

you came in with the garden refuse 
from my little deck and thawed, all unbeknownst to me. when you emerged 
from the garbage bag, in all your very large, winged glory, you scared 
me.

i had to set upon you. you couldn't over winter with me. and i couldn't set you free.


you will know go to you grave with the left over spaghetti. a bad end.

i shall set up a small shrine to you and honor your brethren.

"talking
 about myself is revolting to me. it makes me ill for days to talk about
 myself. for years no one paid any attention to me, no one wanted to 
know a thing about me. now, because i’ve been in a picture, i’m expected
 to answer any and all personal questions. i’m just not doing it." — katharine hepburn

suit of one color










"only lisa and [today team member sylvia jeffreys] know about the
 suit. they often remark that it's getting a bit stinky. i'm hoping to 
get it into the dry cleaners at the end of the year." 





karl stefanovic revealed that (as a comment on sexism in the media) he has been wearing the same suit on air every day for a year and no one noticed.

after female co-hosts were constantly criticized about what they wore, he began his one suit marathon to see if the same would happen to him.

yeah, no. 

"no one has noticed; no one gives a shit. but women, they wear the wrong
 colour and they get pulled up. they say the wrong thing and there’s 
thousands of tweets written about them. women are judged much more 
harshly and keenly for what they do, what they say and what they wear… 
i’ve worn the same suit on air for a year - except for a couple of times
 because of circumstance - to make a point. i’m judged on my interviews,
 my appalling sense of humour - on how i do my job, basically. whereas 
women are quite often judged on what they’re wearing on how their hair 
is." -karl stefanovic

curves are so emotional. (piet mondrian)






 recently re-introduced to piet mondrian's naturalism phase, followed by the move into the landscapes and luminsm, the lush yet stark color is almost intoxicating.



practicing yoga, piet strikes a pose. apologies for late night cheesiness.

the man (born in the netherlands) joins other dutch painters to be stared at for hours. but all previous for me had been realists that would capture me with a dew drop on the petal of one flower amongst so many wondrous things. there are a few at the milwaukee art museum that i could cram my face so near that i could (thank the gods) see the brush strokes.


"pieter cornelis mondrian was born on march 7th 1872 in amersvoort
 in central holland and lived there for the first eight years of his 
life. he was the second child of four, with two brothers and one sister.
 his father pieter cornelis sr. was headmaster of an elementary school, a
 gifted draftsman and amateur artist. uncle frits mondrian was a 
self-taught painter and commercially successful, even the russian court 
bought his work. as piet jr. progressed towards abstract art, he came 
into conflict with uncle frits, which seems to have had something to do 
with piet mondrian signing his paintings with "piet mondrian" (instead of mondriaan) from 1912 on."*



-on view from apartment..."trees! how ghastly!" piet mondrian 

"in 1908 mondrian became deeply involved in the latest developments in 
art, and in the course of the next 10 years or so he developed with 
astonishing rapidity through a succession of styles. he began to use 
pure, glowing colors and expressive brushwork under the influence of 
pointillism and fauvism in pictures which are almost like those of 
vincent van gogh in their vivid colors and intensity of expression. 
motifs such as church towers and windmills were painted in a blaze of 
color with staccato, pointillist brushstrokes. but mondrian soon turned 
to a more monumental and simplified treatment in which the motif was 
depicted close up, in isolation, dominating the picture area 
symmetrically, and the pointillist brushstrokes were replaced by large 
unmodulated areas of color." **  


his eventual move to paris began his move from naturalism to toward cubism which lead to his own neoplasticism (de stijl).

from the red tree to the gray tree, the change in styles is exuberant and astonishing. 

"while mondrian was visiting home in 1914, world war i
 began, forcing him to remain in the netherlands for the duration of the
 conflict. during this period, he stayed at the laren artist's colony, 
there meeting bart van der leck and theo van doesburg,
 who were both undergoing their own personal journeys toward 
abstraction. van der leck's use of only primary colors in his art 
greatly influenced mondrian. after a meeting with van der leck in 1916, 
mondrian wrote, "my technique which was more or less cubist, and 
therefore more or less pictorial, came under the influence of his 
precise method." *** van doesburg founded a magazine called "de stijl" (the style) for which piet mondrian wrote a few articles.



"they were of the opinion that artists, architects and sculptors should 
work together to create a new society that would be in tune with "the 
laws of the universe". the art that went with it should be clear in form
 and spiritual, as opposed to earthly. natural forms were earthly, 
straight lines and angles spiritual. thus "it would not be impossible to
 create a paradise on earth", they said.
now de stijl is known as an art movement, almost synonymous with the 
red, yellow and blue neo-plasticism paintings of piet mondrian." *

and thus were created all the paintings that are now synonymous with mondrian.

ten steps to overcoming chronic painby mark grant machronic
 pain is a serious problem but is often made worse by misinformation, 
negative attitudes and beliefs, outdated ideas, negative emotions. it is recognized that chronic pain is often mismanaged, not because we lack 
adequate treatments, but because of fear and ignorance. these steps are 
designed to help you mentally cope with chronic pain in the best way 
possible.1. make sure you understand what kind of a problem pain really is.chronic
 pain is different to other medical problems, which can often be treated
 relatively easily and successfully. chronic pain is a complex illness, 
caused and maintained by a combination of physical, psychological and 
neurological factors.these multiple causes make it difficult to 
pinpoint any one cause for pain, or any one treatment. pain is also 
often dismissed or poorly treated because of the 'baggage' of old ideas 
about pain - for example, pain where the physical cause is unknown is 
often under-treated. this is despite the fact that the role of 
neurological factors means pain can occur in the absence of external 
causes and that such pain should not be dismissed or considered 
abnormal.the medical establishment has struggled to meet the 
challenge of pain, and now recognizes that this problem cannot be 
overcome without combining input from other disciplines such as 
psychology and physical therapies. pain is also a subjective experience 
which is impossible to accurately measure. pain involves a range of 
emotional reactions including anxiety, fear and depression.2. acceptancechronic
 pain is so awful that sometimes it's easier to escape into wishing it 
had never happened, or hoping for a miracle cure. if persistent, these 
common reactions to pain can actually become a bit of a trap. you need 
to face the reality of what's happened, and find constructive ways of 
dealing with it.acceptance means more than just intellectually 
knowing that you have pain, it means actually allowing yourself to feel 
the anxiety, fear, anger and grief that go with pain. acceptance is a 
process, which requires progressively acknowledging all your feelings, 
and getting your physical and emotional needs.in order to accept
 and go through the negative emotions associated with chronic pain, you 
must have adequate safety and support. safety means having adequate 
control over your pain through the right combination of medical, 
physical and psychological treatment inputs. support means having 
adequate emotional support from family and friends giving you a feeling 
of containment and security.the end product of acceptance is reduced pain, inner peace, less anxiety and better coping.3. take control.after
 many months or even years of pain and failed treatments, its easy to 
slip into feeling hopeless and that nothing can be done. pain sufferers 
are often the butt of negative treatment and it's easy to end up feeling
 angry and victimized. they often have some justification for feeling 
this way.maybe you didn't cause the pain, and maybe you aren't 
happy with some aspects of your treatment, but guess what? - life isn't 
fair. blaming others for your problems, however well-justified, turns 
you into a victim and is like giving away control of your life. you are 
allowing yourself to be led by your emotions, but you do have a choice. 
take the easy path (which isn't really so easy) and simply blame others,
 or take control and get information, communicate assertively with your 
doctor, practicing pain-management strategies such as regular exercise, 
pacing and relaxation and stress-management.you need to decide 
whether you want to be a victim or a survivor, a passenger or a driver. 
your pain is no-one else's problem but your own. you do have rights and 
even responsibilities as a health consumer and a patient. because 
chronic pain is difficult to detect or measure, you need to be an 
informed, active participant in your treatment.don't be afraid 
to ask questions, don't be afraid to tell the doctor what you think and 
what you want, don't be afraid to ask for stronger pain relief.4. have a good working relationship with your doctor.an
 open and trusting relationship with your doctor is essential. this 
means being able to tell your doctor how you feel, ask questions and 
feel listened to and understood.the doctor-patient relationship 
must be a two-way street. although you rely on your doctor's "expert" 
opinion for treatment advice, he depends on you for accurate information
 on which to base his decisions. it is your responsibility to describe 
your symptoms as accurately as possible and to report back regarding 
treatment outcomes, even if unfavourable.under-reporting of pain
 has been identified as one of the biggest causes of mismanagement of 
pain. the doctor-patient relationship can be undermined by bad 
communication, ignorance, arrogance and fear. for example, many people 
are actually afraid to tell their doctor how they are feeling for fear 
of being labelled as weak or a complainer. other patients report 
down-playing the severity of their pain because they don't want their 
doctor to feel like a failure!you should feel that you can talk 
to your doctor, that he listens and respects you, and be satisfied that 
he is working competently and thoroughly on your behalf. you also have a
 right to change doctors if you are dissatisfied.5. never ignore pain.in
 the treatment of chronic pain it has become fashionable to recommend 
ignoring pain (after medical investigations are complete) in the belief 
that it is only pain and there is nothing physically wrong.this 
approach represents a pendulum-swing away from the old fashioned notion 
of prescribing bed-rest in favor of maintaining activity. the idea is 
that inactivity only leads to depression and does not help the problem 
anyway.however, with certain types of pain, this can lead to a 
cycle of aggravation, sleep deprivation, exhaustion and increased pain 
and suffering, particularly if you are someone who typically ignores 
pain (ignoring pain is of course, what causes most repetitive strain 
injuries).the other problem with ignoring pain is that every 
time pain occurs, it leaves an imprint in your nervous system, a kind of
 'pain memory'. these repetitive pain experiences lead to over-stimulation of the nervous system and the generation of spontaneous 
pain signals, leading to a cycle of stress and pain. there are thus 
sound reasons for wanting to avoid pain, but again, total inactivity is 
not the answer. the best approach is a balanced one with paced activity 
levels and avoiding undue aggravation of the pain.6. have a balanced approach to physical activity.it
 can be tempting to adopt a "do nothing" approach, in the hope that you 
may avoid further pain. as we have indicated, since chronic pain is 
partly caused by neurological changes, avoiding activity will not stop 
the pain. avoiding activity also leads to muscle wasting and a build-up 
of waste-products in the tissues, which can actually exacerbate pain.at
 other times, you may feel frustrated and force yourself to complete 
relatively major tasks (eg mowing the lawns) knowing that it will hurt 
later. this may cause you to have to take two days of bed rest to 
recover. this "all or nothing" approach is inappropriate and ineffective
 in the long run.you need to pace activity levels. you can do 
this on your own, via "trial and error" or with a bit of 'coaching' in 
the form of professional help. the support and guidance of a sympathetic
 health professional is highly desirable to maintain motivation and deal
 with fears and obstacles along the way.7. sleep! sleep! sleep!loss
 of sleep caused by inadequately managed pain can lead to a cycle of 
fatigue, depression and irritability. inability to sleep, or waking up 
feeling tired, are signs that your pain is not being managed properly. 
developing a restful sleep pattern is essential to coping with chronic 
pain. improving your sleep will give you more energy and help you feel 
more able to cope.there are many things you can do to get better
 sleep including relaxing, perhaps by taking a hot bath, listening to 
music or playing a favorite relaxation tape before going to sleep; 
self-hypnosis; a good mattress; posture; medication; and good overall 
stress-management.8. make sure you have adequate support.many
 chronic pain sufferers become isolated, alienated from loved ones, 
their work-mates and society. inadequate social or emotional support can
 lead to isolation, depression, and increased risk of suicide. people 
who normally pride themselves on being independent and not needing 
others are particularly 'at risk'.unfortunately, the negative 
reactions of others can discourage chronic pain sufferers from talking 
about their problems or seeking help. the unhelpful reactions of people 
you thought you could rely on can be very disappointing, it's another 
thing that falls into the 'life isn't fair' basket.the reality 
is it's simply ridiculous to expect yourself to be able to cope on your 
own with a chronic illness that robs you of your ability to work love 
and play. having adequate emotional support greatly increases your 
ability to cope.talking to close family and friends is vital. a 
family talk with your doctor of psychologist can also help by enabling 
them to learn more about your condition and talk about things in a 
neutral environment.9. don't expect people who don't have pain to understand what it's like.it's
 frustrating, and easy to get angry when others don't seem to 
understand. however, because chronic pain sufferers often have no 
visible injury, it is easy for family and friends, and especially 
children, to forget there is anything wrong. they may also 'forget' 
because it is hard for them to have to live with the knowledge that a 
loved one is in pain.so don't expect people who don't have pain 
to understand what it's like and be prepared to have to remind others 
about your limitations. children especially cannot be expected to 
understand the implications of a condition like chronic pain. it's a 
lesson that has to be repeated many times.10. forgive yourself.the
 lost ability to work, love and play caused by chronic pain can create 
feelings of guilt and failure. become aware of your own expectations, 
and any feelings of shame or guilt and examine them critically. chances 
are you didn't ask to be in pain.repressed feelings of shame 
lead to resentment and later emerge as anger. feeling guilty can also be
 a subtle form of self-indulgence - when you engage in self-blame you 
are really wallowing in self-pity.forgiveness and letting go of guilt will be easier if you choose a proactive approach by adopting these 10 steps.

from unlikely words tumbling, more words on bill murray than you can shake a gopher at.

enjoy.

there’s a bill murray interview in the latest esquire that has some good stuff. there’s also a few parts that should have been cut.


 i’m not trying to be coy. it’s just practical for me. 
when the phone started ringing too many times, i had to take it back to 
what i can handle. i take my chances on a job or a person as opposed to a
 situation. i don’t like to have a situation placed over my head.

 for hardcore fans, here is a big profile of murray from 2004 where he talks about not enjoying the making of steve zissou:



“a fireplace.” murray sounds sardonic; i’m unsure if he’s 
joshing about the fireplace. he spent five months in italy this past 
winter making the life aquatic with steve zissou, due out this 
christmas, his third film with director wes anderson. apparently, 
fireplace or no, it wasn’t fun, at least for mr. bill. all the action 
takes place on a boat—murray’s character, steve zissou, is a jacques 
cousteau type seeking to avenge his partner’s death by shark—but murray 
won’t discuss the awful details. “it’s like talkin’ about war 
stories,” he says. “i can’t even think about it. my impression of italy 
before doing this job was that it’s one of the greatest, most beautiful 
places in the world. after this job, if you say ‘italy’ to me, it’s like
 a whole lotta cockroaches in one room—you don’t know what to deal with 
first. it was by far the hardest job i’ve ever had, and i always work 
hard. i work the same hard on all of ‘em. but this one—i’ve been kidding
 about it, saying they almost broke me, and they may have and i just 
don’t know it yet.” well, i say, i’m sure it’s gonna turn out to be a good—
 “god damn it,” murray snarls, “the movie better be the greatest movie 
ever made. if it’s not, i’m gonna kill anderson. he’s a dead man. if 
it’s not the greatest movie ever made, or in the top ten, he may as well
 just move to china and change his name to chin, and he better get 
himself a small room in a small town—and even then, i’ll hunt him down.”

 and then, because i love you all very much and i was bored 
yesterday, i went looking for as many bill murray articles as i could 
find. august, 1984. bill murray and john byrum. rolling stonenovember, 1988. the rumpled anarchy of bill murray. new york timesjuly, 1990 bill murray. “quick change” artist. rogerebert.comfebruary, 1993. groundhog day review. nytimes.comjanuary, 1999. a conversation with actor bill murray. charlie rosefebruary, 2001. bill murray. salon.comdecember, 2004. life enigmatic with bill murray. usa todaydecember, 2004. never out of his depth. washington postfebruary, 2005. shotgun golf with bill murray. espnoctober, 2005. pearce meets bill murray. the guardianjune 2010. bill murray: the man who knew too much. blackbookjuly, 2010. bill murray: the curious case of hollywood’s white whale. ew.comjuly, 2010. bill murray. the moviefone blogaugust, 2010. bill murray is ready to see you now. gq
