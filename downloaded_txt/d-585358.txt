welcome!
the mind brain behavior interfaculty initiative (mbb) was introduced in 1993 to encourage an interdisciplinary community of faculty from across the university to engage in research and other academic activities aimed at elucidating the structure, function, evolution, development, aging, and pathology of the brain in the context of human behavior, genetics, and society. since then, our initiative has expanded to include all members of the harvard community who have a connection to the study of the mind, the brain, or behavior. learn more
