          does your software team speak the same language?

aligning on what basic ui elements are called is a great starting point.

it doesn’t even matter what name your team chooses as long as everyone agrees on it.

names should hint at purpose.

          from product talk: empower product teams with product outcomes, not business outcomes

good discovery starts with a clear desired outcome. this sounds simple, but many product teams are responsible for business outcomes they can't really control. in her first post as an official product talk author, hope gurion explores the power of using product outcomes rather than business outcomes. it's a good one.

          "the guide to minimum viable products" is an amazing set of case studies, well put together with deep insights. industry experts reveal the secrets behind their mvp success and here's some takeaways:

1. essence of mvps: more than just a minimal product, an mvp is about delivering maximum value with minimal resources. it's about crafting a minimal solution to a pain point in order to identify the perfect balance of learning, testing and customer satisfaction. an mvp is not the end goal in itself but a larva towards a larger beast.

2. product minimalism & viability: the guide stresses the need to prioritize core features that resonate with early adopters, ensuring the product isn't just viable but also memorable. it has to be revolutionary, otherwise your mvp is just another name in the game.

3. mvp testing & execution: validate. validate. validate. create several hypotheses and test them before development if possible. this way resources are well utilized.

4. stay focused: avoid common mvp mistakes like overemphasizing speed over quality or misunderstanding your target audience. be clear of your product's core offerings and stick to it. is it ease? is it interoperability? is it speed? or is it price? every iteration must carry the same scope with more features.

whether you're a startup or a seasoned entrepreneur, this guide is a good starting point to building mvps that truly make an impact. the team at yeti labs collectively has an experience of over 200 projects, with a handful valued at millions today. it means that we have built a nose for sniffing out great products. you can receive consultation on long-term product roadmaps so contact us today.
