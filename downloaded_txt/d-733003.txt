mayor's december 2nd covid update



 

mayor reinersman's december 2nd update regarding current covid conditions






the city of independence ky
the city of independence is located in the "heart" of kenton county. independence is located about 15 minutes south of cincinnati, ohio and offers a unique lifestyle different from neighboring towns because we are able to offer urban amenities in a rural setting.
independence is one of the fastest growing cities in the commonwealth and was recently ranked as the 99th fastest growing city in the nation. we encourage you to visit independence and see why so many are quickly making us the place they call home.
