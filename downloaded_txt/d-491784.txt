expert care
for baton rouge
since opening our doors in 1900, baton rouge general has been a part of
	 many of our community’s groundbreaking milestones in healthcare.
	 our hospital was the site of the first ever heart surgery in baton rouge,
	 we created the very first diabetes program, and we opened the first burn
	 center and chemical dependency facilities in the state. through historic
	 changes in medicine, extraordinary developments in equipment and technology,
	 and momentous shifts in demographics and community needs, baton rouge
	 general has remained at the forefront of patient care.













comprehensive healthcare services
we remain committed to serving the people of baton rouge. between three
	 campuses, our hospitals offer care from the neonatal intensive care unit
	 to hospice. from our acclaimed regional burn center, to our award-winning
	 cancer program and heart services, our experienced team of professionals
	 is here to get you healthier. and with primary care and urgent care clinics
	 located throughout baton rouge and the surrounding areas, our physician
	 group provides patients with comprehensive care and a full suite of specialties,
	 including internal and family medicine and specialty care.
