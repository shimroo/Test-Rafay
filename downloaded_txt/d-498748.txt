trinity church is a worshiping church, a welcoming church, and an active church. everything that we are, and everything that we do, is rooted in our relationship with god — father, son, and holy spirit — as followers of jesus christ. we encounter god in our worship: in scripture and in the sacraments, in prayer and in song. we respond to god’s love for us by loving others actively — welcoming our neighbors near and far, seeking peace, and pursuing justice. for nearly one hundred and ninety years, trinity church has been a beacon of faith, hope, and love in the very heart of princeton; an episcopal congregation in the diocese of new jersey devoted to striking, spirit-filled worship in the anglican prayer book and choral traditions, lifelong christian formation and fellowship, and the care and comfort of those most in need in our community and in the world, always aspiring to be a visible and tangible sign of christ’s ineffable love. 













we believe god’s love is expansive and unconditional and that through christ, god has called us to love one another as god loves us. we welcome all people regardless of gender, race, age, culture, ethnic background, sexual orientation, economic circumstance, family configuration, or difference of ability. we celebrate the worth, dignity, and gifts of every person as a child of god.
