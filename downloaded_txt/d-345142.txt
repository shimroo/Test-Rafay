i noticed reading my competitions web sites, they like to use  words like pet, companions, family members and the like. where scheurman's k9  academy uses dog, pack and team member. the reason is simple, that in order for  a dog to function within a human society we must always remember the dog, is a  different species. the humans that form the dog's pack, must strive to fulfill  his or her needs as a dog. yes dogs have needs, and they certainly have wants,  but anthropomorphic thinking is not beneficial to the dog or to the symbiotic relationship  dogs and humans strive share. while scheurmanâs k9 academy  may consider our dogs family  members, we must resist treating them in ways they can't understand. too many social  disorders are created when we demand human behavior from a dog. â besides dog is god spelled backwards!
