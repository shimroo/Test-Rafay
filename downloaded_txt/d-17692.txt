testimonials



the course was very well designed and with the latest information. both instructors were just amazing; from the theory to the practical applications they always kept the class of very senior officers interested at all times and wanting more.
– j.p. internal affairs agent investigative interview techniques for internal affairs investigators


instructors were very energetic and passionate about what they were teaching. this made a challenging course fun while still focusing on the topic.
– a.eat-scene traffic crash/traffic homicide investigation


hands down the best course/training i’ve had since being a law enforcement officer. very eye-opening scenarios. extremely knowledgeable instructors.
– deputy j.k.marine enforcement operations


the instructors were very knowledgeable about the topics. it’s impressive how the instructors broke down the information and made it easy for me to understand.
– e.e. event data recorder use in tcr


great course. taught me a lot more than i expected to learn in one week. the practical exercises, not only viewing patterns, but making them, greatly helped.
– csi m.h.shooting incident reconstruction


good up-to-date-information. thoroughly enjoyed this course. great instructor cadre. will be sending my sergeant at the soonest opportunity.
– lt. r.c.police internal affairs
