welcome to our new site
sponsored by drawing down the moon personal matchmaking
		our old 'classic' site can still be accessed here



















we are different

	
	our profiles offer much greater depth & breadth than any of the competition. our biggest source of referral is from our own members - which speaks for itself.










longer profiles 





our profiles offer much greater depth & breadth than any of the competition. 
our unique compatibility questionnaire has over 100 provoking & revealing questions which give fascinating insights into attitudes & lifestyle. we can even rate which type of humour appeals to you! 
our biggest source of referral is from our own members - which speaks for itself.











thinking people 





we are aimed slightly more towards educated professionals than other sites.
our members tend to be a little more likely to read quality papers like the times, guardian, telegraph than the sunday sport.











genuine free membership 





we have a great eco-system of free and paying members. on loveandfriends free members can communicate with paying members without having to pay anything. itâs great that our full members support us with their subscriptions and in return they get lots more dating opportunities.












success stories
we are proud that our dating site has brought many couples together over the years.

the happiest girl in the world 





my user name is a_challenge and i would like to terminate my membership as i have met my soulmate through the site (virtual-jules ) and we are very much in love.
thank you so much for providing such an excellent site, good luck to all the hopefuls on the site, don't give up, your special someone could be the next e-mail.
jules is the best thing that's ever happened to me, made me. i'm very lucky to have found him, thank you l & f.











so far, all's going very well indeed!  





i really love the site!
i've met some wonderful people on here! i'm leaving on holiday for a few weeks so i need to put my membership on hold.
plus, *smile* i have met a wonderful man, but it's too soon, as of yet, to say what will develop, but so far, all's going very well indeed!
thanks, l&f!











all of them were nice, interesting people 





thanks for your message - i will add to the positive comments i've already made by saying i thought the whole l&f style is excellent - really good that you can join without paying up front to start with, also the questions etc for the profiles are well designed and the logos and whole look of the site is witty and intelligent and appealing. 











thanks again for such a wonderful service.





hi ...this is further to another email i sent you.
i met someone through your site at the start of january, and now we're engaged and we're going to get a house together.
just wanted to say thanks again for such a wonderful service.

	why does love hurt?
	(what a brilliant question!) 

	when they stop loving you, or you stop loving them, you lose the thing in your life that has made you most happy
