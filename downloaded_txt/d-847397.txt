who are flying fish?
our story began in 1993 when two watersports instructors set up a winter watersports training programme in barbados for those who are looking to change in career. fast forward to today, flying fish trains people who are looking for a career on a superyacht, work in the sailing industry, watersports, or cruise ship.
our ethos remains the same; to deliver professional training that leads to a professional qualification, providing you with adventure and employment opportunities worldwide.
