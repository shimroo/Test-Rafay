i wrote a piece for the baltimore banner that's kind of an overview of baltimore rap since 2000, with a great song representing every year of the 21st century. last month the banner also published my profile of infinity knives and brian ennals.

i recently wrote my first article for bandcamp, and it's a look back at the life and work of dwayne "headphones" lawson, a hip hop producer from baltimore who passed away in november. i spoke to a lot of people who knew him and worked with him, including ddm, kane mayfield, eze jackson, greenspan, and his mania music group co-producer brandon lackey, and highlighted some of his best tracks. this was a real labor of love to show appreciation for a guy i had a lot of admiration for.

this weekend marks 10 years since khia "dj k-swift" edgerton's tragic death. the baltimore sun ran a lovely piece about her by brittany britto and wesley case, and wesley quoted me a little bit in the article.

in this week's baltimore city paper, i wrote a big feature about kane mayfield and his debut album, the return of rap, which just came out. i've known kane and followed his music for years now and it's great to hear him put out a record worthy of his talent and get a chance to tell his story.

baltimore rapper and blogger speed on the beat recently invited me to take part in an e-mail q&a for a 'roundtable' with a few other music writers and bloggers. in the last few days, part one and part two were published, and i think it came out pretty interestingly, i tried to be honest and maybe a little revealing about my process, and it was cool to see how the other respondents answered the same questions.labels: speed on the beat
