dr. candis watts smithvice provost, undergrad. education “every time i interact with the learning innovation team, i come away feeling optimistic and with some sort of evidence-based tool or strategy that i can use to help my students learn – and to help them think about learning how to learn – and with a sense of community support. learning innovation in many ways is a connecting node for folks around campus who want to elevate their craft, grapple with new ideas, think about challenges together, and to learn from one another.”
  
dr. sheila patekdirector of muser “learning innovation is an integral partner with muser.  they guided our university-wide launching of the program and encouraged our technology-based innovations for equity and inclusion.  muser has benefited tremendously from the breadth and expertise of li’s staff and the depth of their engagement in supporting this important initiative here and beyond duke.”
