‘relentless’ release

pet shop boys have announced a 30th anniversary edition of ‘relentless’. 
the highly valued and ultra-rare album is being made available as an individual release for the first time in decades. slated to hit shops on 20th october, fans can choose between limited-edition yellow vinyl, complete with new artwork, cd and digital formats. pre-orders are being taken now. 
“this album was an experiment for us 30 years ago with its six new extended dance tracks. we’re very proud of it and delighted it’s now getting the stand-alone release it deserves,” pet shop boys said in a statement about the forthcoming anniversary package. 
originally landing in 1993, ‘relentless’ is best known as one half of the double-lp ‘very relentless’, alongside bestselling lp ‘very’, which hit number one in the uk album charts and produced five top 20 singles, including ‘can you forgive her?’ and ‘go west’. 
‘relentless’, which comprises six club-ready trance, progressive house and breaks-influenced tracks such as ‘kdx 125’ and ‘the man who has everything’, only received a stand-alone release via triple-12″ vinyl, and just 500 copies were pressed at the time. as a result, the long-player became one of the most sought-after pieces of pet shop boys history.

volume (catalogue part 2)

marking the fortieth anniversary of the duo’s first release—“west end girls”—pet shop boys volume presents the group’s entire visual output to date in a contemporary literary format.
pet shop boys — neil tennant and chris lowe — are arguably the most successful duo in the history of pop music. three-time brit award winners and six-time grammy nominees, they have sold more than 50 million records worldwide. published to coincide with the fortieth anniversary of the release of “west end girls”—the single that reached number one in the united kingdom, united states, canada, finland, hong kong, lebanon, israel, new zealand, and norway— pet shop boys volume is the definitive catalog of the group’s visual output to date.
newly reconfigured into a literary format, this revised and expanded edition now chronicles the entire visual output of pet shop boys from 1984 to 2024. it includes the sleeve artworks and packaging; stills from every video, film, and performance; stage sets and costumes; photoshoots; publications; and merchandise. photographs, designs, and productions by celebrated collaborators, including mark farrow, wolfgang tillmans, martin parr, bruce weber, sam taylor-johnson, zaha hadid, and derek jarman, among others, are accompanied by short commentaries and captions by music writer chris heath. accompanying the essay by philip hoare on pet shop boys’ practice, is a new introduction by libby sellers discussing the importance of pet shop boys to the history of design, and a foreword by turner prize-winning artist jeremy deller reflecting on the enduring impact of the music and image of tennant and lowe.

no release date has been announced.

in depth podcast

we recommend that you download and listen to the new in depth pet shop boys podcast. unofficial, but acknowledged by the official psb site. six episodes are available, with more planned for the future.

prior to recording the podcasts, the hosts graham and chris had only met once ‘on a wet wednesday night’ in a pub near where they both live in west yorkshire in the north of england. 
the tone is intended to be celebratory, humorous, heartfelt, positive and upbeat. as well as sharing psb facts, opinions, crazy theories, friendly debate and some frankly terrible puns, they also share personal anecdotes and memories, and try to bring to life the role pet shop boys’ music has played in their broader lives.
