                        welcome to worcester golf club                    









the championship course is situated in the foothills of the brandwacht mountains with a panoramic view of worcester and the breede river valley.  gary has described the site as one of the finest in the world.  the rugged natural beauty of the karoo has been enhanced by indigenous trees, dams and watercourses.  it is a challenging course which rewards daring shots but can severely punish bad ones.  the large bentgrass greens were built and are maintained to the highest standards.
