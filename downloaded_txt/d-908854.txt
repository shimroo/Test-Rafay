meditation 
for the child in all of us.



this site is for the young at heart 
and the young in mind. we hope you will like it.
a downloadable radio quality audio file (mp3) 
of each class and guided meditation has been created for you to listen to, click 
on the links within each class.

a word for the grown-ups. (click 
here)
meditation is easy for children.

many great meditation masters ask 
their adult students to be more like children so they will meditate better. 
what is meditation for children?
we meditate to find and listen to our heart.

our heart is the real home of us. 
when we can listen to our heart, we automatically feel love and joy, but also we 
will know what we can be.

do you ever get sad? do 
you sometimes worry too much over silly things? do you get angry and lose your 
temper? 

what would you say, if i was to tell you that meditation will help you 
become the happiest person in the world? would you be willing to try it for the 
next 10 days 
for at least 5 minutes?
it 
isn't a trick. in 10 days you will see the change in yourself.
you will see that the happiest people in the world are 
people that know and understand their hearts, and the most confused and sad people are those 
that don't. 
if you are not sure, take the time 
to look around and see for yourself. 

people that know their heart will be more 
loving and happy. sad, angry people are lost, because they have lost their 
heart.
when you are ready, you can try a 
meditation exercise here for your age group, we have classes from ages 5 to 13. you can try the other age 
groups as well, as the ages are only a guide. you can even try the rest of our 
online classes for grownups when you have been meditating for a few weeks - but we wanted to 
get you started with something we thought would work more easily for you. 
you'll 
find that no matter the age group the exercises are enjoyable and very powerful. 
please
contact us with your 
thoughts on these meditations and what others you would like to do, as we really 
value your help, thank-you!




children are the world's best meditators!
