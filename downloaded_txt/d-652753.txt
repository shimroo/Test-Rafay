	 recap - our personal medals haul
	 
    


hello again.  sorry for the not posting earlier.  still encountering internet issues.  resorted to the starbucks around the corner.  we are still in vancouver.  had the opportunity to meet with some folks while here, and then will attend the governor's reception for all washington state olympic athletes returning from the games later this week.  we've had the opportunity to reflect on our personal experience, and it's been amazing.  not only did the u.s. win the most medals ever in a winter olympics, we were so fortunate to personally witness 11 of the 37 medals.
saturday, feb. 13th - ladies moguls - hannah kearney-gold; shannon barkey-bronze
we endured sideways rain, but it was worth it.
sunday, feb. 14th - men's moguls - bryon wilson-bronze
we also witnessed alex bilodeau win canada's first gold medal on home soil. - so cool!  then we learned from my sister marlene that bryon is a shirt tail relative of mine - 15 degrees of separation.
monday, feb. 15th - men's snowboard cross - seth wescott-gold
we were cheering for local favorite nathan holland who finished 4th, but a gold is a gold!
wednesday, feb. 17th - men's snowboard halfpipe - shaun white-gold;  scotty lego-bronze
the most amazing thing to see how much higher the flying tomato gets than all of the other riders. he deserves the hipe! 
thursday, feb. 18th - men's figure skating - evan lysacek-gold 
i don't need to say anything more here - our biggest medal highlight.
saturday, feb. 20th - men's short track 1000 meter - apolo anton ohno-bronze
our eighth medal-short track never disappoints.  we had a ball.
monday, feb. 22nd - figure skating - dance - meryl davis and charlie white-silver
tannith and ben should have won bronze, but with the cold war heating up after evan's gold they gave it to the russians.  (my little editorializing)
friday, feb. 26th - short track speed skating - katherine reutter - silver in the 1000 meter; apolo and team usa won the bronze in the 5000 meter relay
it was fitting that my favorite event the 5000 meter relay capped off the events that we attended where the u.s. won a medal.  i'm exhausted from just recounting it!

	 canadian cocktails yacht-side
	 
    


because of toby's coffee clatch connection, we were invited to a fun cocktail party aboard the "water buoy", the yacht owned by coffee clatcher kay ackles, whose late husband bob was an executive in both the nfl and the cfl for years.  we met other clatchers there, along with kay's family members.  it's been quite special to be included in their interesting circle.

	 meet mary mcneil
	 
    


toby here. the girls are giving me a hard time about my lack of posting... this is my early morning coffee crew that meets at 7am every day at urban fare, our neighborhood grocery store and hangout. it is a very eclectic, diversified and a highly powered group. the person to my right is mary mcneil, the minister (head honcho) of the 2010 vancouver olympic games. she has given us daily insight of the behind-the-scenes scenarios and happenings of the games. sitting in front of me is david boyd, owner of a international video surveillance company. david was so kind to invite me into their exclusive canadian group. along with carl and barb (note their cool new hats) is dean who works for interwest, owners of whistler, and rod mcneil, mary's husband. at the end of the table is jeff who owns aqua bus. aqua bus has a ton of small boats that act as ferries to shuttle people all around the false creek water inlet located near the olympic village, gm place (site of opening & closing ceremonies), canada hockey place (hockey venue) and various other sites including our condo. aqua bus has played an instrumental role in the successful transportation system. not pictured are approximately a dozen other members of the group that show up at various times or days. 
making new friends with such a friendly bunch has been a highlight of our awesome experience at these olympics.

	 brian's coaching technique
	 
    


if you ever get a chanced to watch brian orser, do.  brian is yu-na kim's coach, and she took the gold medal last night in ladies figure skating.  while her skating is truly lovely and undeniably medal-worthy, it was almost as enjoyable watching brian as she skated.  he's very animated and practically performs every move along with her as he stands rinkside watching her.  he must be exhausted by the end of her long program - it's quite entertaining!

	 ladies final
	 
    


last night was the ladies final in figure skating.  while we didn't hold out much hope that our us gals would medal, we were still very proud of both our ladies, rachel and mirai.  it was great to see mirai post such an incredible score.  and seeing canada's joannie rochette take bronze was a huge triumph in light of what she's endured this week with the sudden passing of her mother here on sunday.  a brave and beautiful young lady.  all in all, very impressive skating; all the ladies brought their a-games and skated their hearts out.

	 big dogs
	 
    


there is a hot dog stand down the street from our condo.  it's called big dogs and its proprietor's name is shaun.  we'd been admiring him from afar but decided that yesterday was the day to test his professed kielbasa skills.  

they are impressive.

	 we love food
	 
    


vancouver is not only a totally hip city, it's a food lover's mecca.  between all the fabulous markets and restaurants featuring food from every corner of the world, it's often hard to decide where to stop and refuel.

drooling may now commence.

	 you just never know who you'll bump into at the olympics
	 
    


while enjoying a wonderful lunch at the sand bar on granville island, we happened to be standing next to a lady wearing an ioc (international olympic committee) credential.  barb asked her what her role with the ioc was, and she answered, "nothing, my husband is affiliated with it."  pressing on, barb asked her husband's role, and the lady replied, "oh, he's president of it".  turns out we were talking to anne rogge, the wife of jacques rogge, the 8th and current president of the ioc!!!

	 it's all about the hats!
	 
    


yesterday was hat day!  we all sported new chapeaus, all with some kind of nation theme.  (hint:  everyone but carl was supporting the usa; he chose to go with team canada!)



















we headed up to cypress mtn. to watch ladies aerials finals.  we caught the sea bus over to north van and had dinner at a waterfront restaurant.  it had been a rather crummy day all day but as we were having dinner the clouds parted to give us a beautiful sunset over downtown vancouver.
















it was a very foggy night on the mountain, in fact when we first arrived we could hardly even see the jumps. 
 
the fog lifted a bit and we were finally able to enjoy some amazing aerial maneuvers.

 



















with all the unseasonably beautiful weather, being up at cypress finally gave dana & carl a real flavor of winter olympics, instead of the spring-like feel it's otherwise had!

	 they don't call them mounties for nothing!
	 
    


the royal canadian mounted police made an appearance in front of the olympic cauldron.  they came trotting down the street in queue (that's canadian for "line"!) and posed in front of the flame for the ultimate canadian photo op.  the horses were gorgeous and so well behaved, and the stunning red of the uniforms against the gray skies and the cauldron behind made for quite the view.  
shortly after that, the martin mars water bomber - the world's largest operational flying boat ever built --  made a fly by and dropped its load of 37,000 litres of water in the harbour right in front of the cauldron.   we happened to be sitting in a waterfront restaurant when the plane flew right overhead.  we could practically see the whites of the pilot's eyes!!!  it was spectacular.  canada has definitely done its part to showcase some of their amazing treasures.
last night's ladies short program was wonderful; real world-class skating and all the athletes seem to have brought their a-games as personal bests were scored by most all the skaters.  the house came down when canadian joannie rochette took the ice and skated a gorgeous, inspired performance.  her mother died just 2 days before from a heart attack here in vancouver and everyone wondered if she would go on to compete in light of the tragedy.  she decided to skate in honor of her mother and there wasn't a dry eye in the house as the music ended and she covered her face with her hands and broke down.  everyone was on their feet crying and cheering her incredible bravery and poise.  she's currently in 3rd place going into the final so she'll definitely be a crowd favorite tomorrow night for the free skate.  i know we will all be cheering her on.
we are able to enjoy the nightly fireworks show right from our perfectly situated condo.  they occur each night at 10:45 and never cease to amaze and bring us all to "ooh's" and "ahh's".  it's tough to get good pix of them but here's one that's not too bad. 
 well, it's time to sign off as we need to start getting geared up for ladies aerials finals tonight up at cypress mountain.  it's been snowing there all day so we'll definitely need to break out the winter gear tonight.  should be a great competition!

	 falling behind on blogging... shame on us!
	 
    


sorry the blogging has been a bit sporadic.  we've been on the go-go-go, what with the weather having been so incredible the past few days.  but the clouds, wind and rain have finally set in and looks to be our constant companion the rest of the week so that might allow more time for sitting indoors telling our tales to our online followers. 

the weather may not sound the best but rest assured that it hasn't dampened the spirits of these olympic junkies.  we have many fun tales to tell and pix to show!

tomorrow... blog catch-up day!

go usa!!!

	 yes it was great!
	 
    


 
last night we were there for the dance finals.  it was great to see meryl and charlie win the silver medal.  we were sad that tanith and ben finished fourth.  that's not the way we had it scored.  of course the party at usa house was a who's who.  very fun.

	 those crazy costumes - too much folk!
	 
    


 
from original dance on sunday, february 21st all the talk was about the russian's costumes.  we were treated to a lot of cheek, and not in a good way.  what do you think...haven't the costumes jumped the shark.  we preferred the simple costumes the canadian dance team wore.  also the theme for original dance was folk dances.  we felt "folked out" by the time it was over, but with charlie and meryl in second place andtanith and ben in fourth place we felt pretty good about our chances for a medal.

	 lines lines everywhere lines
	 
    


 lines lines everywhere lines, blocking out the scenery....oh wait that's not how it goes.  well that is how it goes here in vancouver.  it feels like everyday this olympics has grown exponentially.  there are huge lines to everything that is free. there is a free "olympic live site" right down the street from us at david lamb park.they have free entertainment and sponsor activities.  we have not taken in any of the free stuff.   however we have been the beneficiary of the fireworks.  almost every night there is a beautiful fireworks display that we can see from our deck, and is a great way to cap off the evening.  toby took pictures but they turned out too dark.  we'll try again tonight.

	 we're having the time of our lives!
	 
    


ok, i have to admit i am sitting in the closet of our condo to write this post (some wireless internet issues) but i can safely say, this has been exactly what we hoped it would be... an amazing olympic experience.  we started at cypress mountain.  we witnessed six u.s. olympic medals in the four events we have attended at cypress.  they are calling cypress mountain their "special" venue.  special - in that it has had many challenges.  from mother nature saying "no snow for you" to crazy lines for concessions and transportation - to having to refund 20,000 standing room tickets because the standing room area became unsafe as a result of melting snow.  but it has been very good to us.   in addition to seeing canada win their fist gold medal on home soil (men's moguls) we have seen an unbelievable medals haul at cypress.  then you add to that evan lysacek winning his gold medal, the historic night we saw tonight, and wow what can i say.  it's the most amazingly beautiful city, and we are so lucky to be here to soak all of this in.

	 going to short track - saw olympic history
	 
    


tonight we went to see short track speed skating where apolo anton ohno won the bronze medal for the 1000 meters.  it was edge of your seat excitement from start to finish.  we were there to witness the most decorated winter olympian win his seventh medal. it doesn't get much better than that!
