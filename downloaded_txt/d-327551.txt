scientology definiton

scientology is a twenty-first-century religion. it comprises a vast body of knowledge extending from certain fundamental truths, and prime among those truths: man is a spiritual being endowed with abilities well beyond those which he normally envisions. he is not only able to solve his own problems, accomplish his goals and gain lasting happiness, but he can achieve new states of awareness he may never have dreamed possible. in one form or another, all great religions have held the hope of spiritual freedom—a condition free of material limitations and misery. 

the question has always been, however, how does one reach such a state, particularly while still living amidst a frantic and often overwhelming society? although modern life seems to pose an infinitely complex array of problems, scientology maintains that the solutions to those problems are basically simple and within every man's reach. difficulties with communication and interpersonal relationships, nagging insecurities, self-doubt and despair—each man innately possesses the potential to be free of these and many other concerns.
scientology offers a pathway to greater freedom.

the study of truth

developed by l. ron hubbard, scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one’s true spiritual nature and one’s relationship to self, family, groups, mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the supreme being. scientology addresses the spirit—not the body or mind—and believes that man is far more than a product of his environment, or his genes. scientology comprises a body of knowledge which extends from certain fundamental truths. 


prime among these are:
man is an immortal spiritual being.
his experience extends well beyond a single lifetime.
his capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized. scientology further holds man to be basically good, and that his spiritual salvation depends upon himself, his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe. 
the ultimate goal of scientology is true spiritual enlightenment and freedom for all.

a 50,000 year search

though it draws on the wisdom of some 50,000 years, scientology is a new religion, one that has isolated fundamental laws of life and, for the first time, developed a workable technology that can be applied to help people achieve a happier and more spiritual existence in the here and now. that scientology’s development and rapid promulgation was made possible, in part, by advances in the physical sciences through the first half of the twentieth century is significant. for it bridges eastern philosophy with western thought. 

in that way, scientology constitutes man’s first real application of scientific methodology to spiritual questions. scientology is something one does, not something one believes in.

a truly unique contemporary religion

while the hope for spiritual freedom is ancient, what scientology is doing is new. the way it is organized is new. the technologies with which it can bring about a new state of being in man are likewise new. because scientology addresses man as a spiritual being, it stands completely apart from other fields which see man as a product of his environment or his genes—fixed in the limitations under which he was born. in contrast, scientology is the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes and other life. 

based upon the tradition of 50 thousand years of thinking men, it is built upon the fundamental truths of life. from these principles, exact methods by which one can improve conditions were derived. and unlike other efforts of improvement, which offered only rules by which men should live, scientology offers real tools for use in everyday life. thus, it does not depend upon a system of beliefs or faith. in scientology, the emphasis is squarely on an exact application of its principles toward the improvement of one’s life and the world in which we live.

scientology principles for life
in scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith. that which is true for you is what you have observed to be true. an individual discovers for himself that scientology works by personally applying its principles and observing or experiencing results.
