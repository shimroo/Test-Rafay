why cartoon tracts?
the gospel in cartoon format
the gospel in cartoon format








each tract has a 24-page engaging story
many christians know the disappointment of handing out wordy leaflet tracts that don't get read. unsaved people simply won't read tracts that are jam-packed with lots of tiny words. but the unsaved love chick tracts, and readily accept them.
 the 24-page chick tract format gets the reader's attention with an engaging story in serious cartoon style. soon, they are captivated by the story which presents a simple gospel message, ending with an invitation to accept christ.

"when i was a waitress, a man and his wife would leave a tract for me with a tip.  eventually, they asked me to join them on a sunday for church and the rest is history. praise the lord, these people cared for my soul...a complete stranger."

"when i was 20 years old, i had been a drug addict and a drunk. heading toward premature death or prison. one day i went to the mailbox and there was a chick tract, ‘this was your life’. i read it and was greatly convicted of my sins. soon after i went to a church and became gloriously saved."

chick mission fund

providing tracts to missionaries overseas is now easier than ever
missionaries from all over the world write us asking if we have available funds to send them free tracts. these missionaries are ready and able to get tracts distributed, but simply lack the funds. you can make a huge difference in their ministries!
here's how you can help:
donate to the chick mission fund and 100% of the funds you give will be used to buy and ship tracts to missionaries worldwide.
if you would like to help them reach more people with the gospel by using chick tracts, please visit our mission fund webpage to make a donation.
