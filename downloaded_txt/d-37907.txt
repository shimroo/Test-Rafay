welcome to drum gods


















































john bonham(bonzo)keith moon(moon the loon)




when john bonham got behind the drums he was an unstop able force and a gods among drummers. he always said that he liked the sound of a drum better than the cymbls. they are used to crash in and out of a solo. his solos were magnificent and did things on drums not thought possible by most.
