about lpa


the louisiana press association’s mission is to develop and maintain a strong alliance of louisiana news media organizations to promote real journalism on any platform, to defend freedom of the press, to lead on public policy efforts that promote transparency and openness in government, and to develop innovative programs that grow advertising, develop new revenue streams and build audiences across all platforms for our members.











delivering marketing solutions with scale & trust!


lpa’s marketing service team is your strategic partner for delivering local engagement on a statewide or even national scale. lpa’s marketing service can provide local, on-the-ground knowledge of every community forum in louisiana and the expertise to engage them.
working with lpa and its members is working with the trusted pillars of your prospect’s communities.











community involvement

lpa is the prime defender of louisiana citizens' ability to review government records, ensure open, accountable government and attend public meetings. through legal and legislative advocacy, lpa ensures that open meetings and public records laws, and law requiring independent public notice publication, are preserved. lpa believes an informed citizenry is best able to monitor and participate in its governing.










member services

the louisiana press association represents newspapers, news websites, magazines, specialty publications, and the people who publish them in every louisiana parish. services include access to educational programs covering a wide variety of subjects, access to a legal hot-line and law guide, participation in ad networks to generate revenues, and working to protect industry interests.
