how do i access my digital tickets? 



all digital tickets to events at the tennessee theatre will show up in your account manager. visit ticketmaster to access, and be sure to download them to your digital wallet before heading to the show! 





how do i get presale codes for tickets?



be sure to subscribe to our newsletter for presale codes - or become a friend of the tennessee theatre for even earlier access to tickets!





why are some tickets so much more expensive?



tickets sold through third party sites are usually a lot more expensive...and we cannot guarantee that they are even real! to avoid any price-gouging or fraud, make sure you are only purchasing tickets through our website, our box office, or ticketmaster.
