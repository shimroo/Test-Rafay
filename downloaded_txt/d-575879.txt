animal lifeline of iowa (ali), founded in 1986 outside of carlisle, iowa, is central iowa’s only special needs, no-kill animal shelter, celebrating nearly 40 years of serving the des moines area and all of iowa. we rescue cats and dogs that are injured, handicapped, have a serious medical condition, are abused, are pregnant, are nursing moms, or are orphans that require bottle feeding. we rehabilitate the animals, who run a higher risk of euthanasia in a traditional shelter setting and then adopt them into loving forever homes. animals are not euthanized because they have been at the shelter for a certain length of time.

animal lifeline of iowa’s 2022 save rate = 95%









































animal lifeline’s no-kill shelter agreementour shelter is committed to saving every animal in our care who can be saved. we do not euthanize healthy or treatable pets even at an owner's request. we only euthanize a pet if: a veterinarian has assessed that there is no chance of recovering an acceptable quality of life, or it would be clearly inhumane or unsafe not to do so immediately, orin cases of irremediable canine aggression when (1) a veterinarian has eliminated medical treatment as a solution; (2) rehabilitation by a specialist in canine behavior has failed; (3) staff and public safety cannot be reasonably assured, or other management protocols seriously compromise the quality of life.the reason(s) our shelter could fall below the 90% benchmark; our shelter has a relatively high number of animals who die in care because: we have a neonatal kitten program. neonatal kittens have fragile immune systems and often arrive at the shelter as orphans and with compromised health. we make every effort to treat and care for kittens until they are eating on their own and healthy enough to go to a foster home, but some lives are still lost despite those efforts.we accept and provide medical care to old, injured, and sick animals. some do not make it, despite our best efforts.
