           large quotations.




the child has the capacity to educate himself, not in typical schools with their exact syllabuses where children must be obedient, but at a school where he is not controlled, does not have to compete, but can work with enthusiasm according to natural laws. if we do not know these laws and respect them, then we are in danger of spoiling this great work of the child's.-dr. maria montessori
