it is our mission to share the good news, love one another, work for justice and recognize that god is in our midst. 











welcome from bishop knisely


the diocese of rhode island is a gathering of more than 50 congregations across the state whose members have been called together by god to care for our neighbors,  to care for one another, and to spread the good news of the gospel. 
our congregations vary in size. some worship in a highly formal style, while others are more relaxed. and our setting range from beautiful historic buildings to a field near a bus stop. regardless of our circumstances, we find our community in common prayer and mutual respect. 
i invite you to learn more about our churches, and i hope you will join us.
