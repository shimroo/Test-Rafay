taste life.paired with music.beer. wine. cider. seltzer.hand-crafted in small batches. designed to move you.



























welcome to notaviva farm brewery & winery, one of the most authentic, down-to-earth family farm winery and brewery combinations in northern virginia. founded as notaviva vineyards in 2008, and expanded to include notaviva brewing in 2019, we are proud of our beverages, our hospitality, our venue and our story.














here’s what folks are saying about notaviva






absolutely love notaviva! one of our favorite local brewery/wineries.  they have everything you could want - beer, wine, seltzer & cider! the outdoor views are amazing!

— j. macnair⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐







definitely our new favorite winery! a very chill and unique atmosphere, i’ve never seen wine paired with music. the owners are wonderful, if your in the area looking for a glass, this place is a must. i can’t wait to come back!

— m. hauser⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐







i absolutely loved the vibe, staff, and selection.  wine, beer, ciders, and seltzers.  i'm on a quest to hit all 53 of these in the area but this one will be my go to.  plus live music now.  perfect.

—j. teeler⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐







a new favorite winery for us. we came for a tasting and fell in love with the place almost instantly. the tasting room is very nice and we can't wait for spring to see how the surrounding area looks from outside in the adirondack chairs.

—j. wood⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐







nice small place with an amazing view. beer and wine and live music with seats indoor and out that can all hear the live music. bring a picnic and enjoy. they also have snacks.

—r. murphy⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐







nice, casual spot in the mountains for wine, beer, and cider. great views, nice staff, and a good selection of drinks! super close to the wv/va line and route 9 yet still quaint & tucked away.

—z. roberts⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐


















“yeah, we grew that here.”not everybody can truly say that.


























sunlight into wineevery aspect of our viticulture is done by hand. at our nano scale, large-scale mechanization in the vineyard just isn’t practical. from late-winter pruning, to spring shoot positioning, to summer leaf pulling, to fall harvest we’re doing everything the old-fashioned way.














farm to kettleour “uncle jimmy” west coast ipa features whole-cone cascade hops grown in the meadow adjoining the vineyard. picked by hand, then air-dried in small bins, these hops go from the trellis to the brew kettle in a matter of days. 


























looking for an unpretentious vibe, great craft beverages and friendly staff? need to hear some original music, something different from the rest of the scene? want to support an authentic family farm dedicated to expressing the most unique aspects of our land? we’d love to have you visit.
