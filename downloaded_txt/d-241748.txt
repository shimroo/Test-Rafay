the constant reader 

“if i don’t drive around the park, i’m pretty sure to make my mark. if i’m in bed each night by ten, i may get back my looks again. if i abstain from fun and such, i’ll probably amount to much; but i shall stay the way i am, because i do not give a damn.” –observation, by dorothy parker
