 grammar me this, grammar me that



                            gerhard erasmus

grammar can be such fun. well, for teachers that is. but can we learn something from a few humorous grammatical puzzles, riddles and discussion questions? here, gerhard erasmus shows us how we can do just that.



















 beginning well in 2025: prioritising well-being in the classroom and beyond



                            anna hasper

as 2025 begins, many of us are likely to reflect and set resolutions for the year ahead. whilst it is great to set measurable results such as ‘use technology in the classroom 3 times a week’ or ‘read 20 books related to teaching’, these statements often overly focus on the outcome. setting intentions is more process-oriented and focuses on our overall way of being and the strategies and support needed, rather than fixating on an end result. in this blog, anna hasper talks about setting intentions for our well-being to begin 2025 well.



















 organisational cycles – is it a new year yet?



                            gerhard erasmus

a new year, of whatever kind, is often a time of celebration, a fresh start, plans for the coming year, but at times, it can mean despair and confusion. here, gerhard erasmus looks at how different cycles in your organisation can mean a ‘new year’ for different people you work with at different times, and how you can best address their needs.

 using visuals to help teach grammar



creative ideas for using images in class. written by katherine bilsborough.



















 advantages of using videos in esl/efl lessons



nowadays many teachers heavily rely on using real-world videos – such as new reports, trailers, clips from tv programmes, etc – as a language teaching resource. using these types of videos can lead to student growth and progress, and greater confidence in using their language skills in real life. read on to discover some advantages of using real-world videos as a tool for teaching a language.



















 the classroom as rehearsal space



imagine introducing a language point in class, or getting learners to read a dialogue in pairs or even a part of a lesson where you are working on word stress with your class… these are all familiar scenarios that can happen face to face or live online. and, in each one, you and/or learners are, in a sense, performers, using storytelling, role-play and voice exercises, with the classroom acting as your rehearsal space.
