uncovering the drivers of pacific ocean deoxygenation threatening marine ecosystems 












new research shows how oxygen changes in the pacific ocean can have far-reaching consequences for marine ecosystems and fisheries around the world.











 






study with us 












making a difference starts here, with our diverse undergraduate, postgraduate and research degree programmes.
our interdisciplinary degrees span the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities, providing you with unique opportunities to explore and tackle global challenges.
open your mind to your options and find a degree that’s perfectly suited to your interests and career aspirations. 











our research 












as one of the largest and most successful groupings of geographers, earth and environmental scientists in the uk, we tackle the most environmental and social challenges of our times. 
we have pioneered research on the human contribution to climate change which helped underpin the un paris agreement, and the scottish government used our work in public health data to respond to the covid-19 pandemic. and that's just the start...
