our company has been using timeledger for years. the website is user-friendly and very
                reliable. it is so intuitive that very little training is required when new staff come onboard. whenever
                we have a question or a service request, it is handled promptly. i have reviewed several competitors’
                products but repeatedly choose to stick with timeledger.
