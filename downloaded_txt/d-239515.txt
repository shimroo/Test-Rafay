the martin luther king conspiracy 
            exposed in memphis


by jim douglass
probe magazine
  according to a memphis jury's verdict on december 8, 1999, in the wrongful death 
lawsuit of the king family versus loyd jowers "and other unknown 
co-conspirators," dr. martin luther king jr. was assassinated by a conspiracy 
that included agencies of his own government. almost 32 years after king's 
murder at the lorraine motel in memphis on april 4, 1968, a court extended the 
circle of responsibility for the assassination beyond the late scapegoat james 
earl ray to the united states government.  read 
                    more  . . .  

 
                     
                    

 who killed john lennon?
 government officials had been keeping strict tabs on the ex-beatle they 
referred to as "mr. lennon." but the official u.s. war against lennon began in 
earnest in 1972 when he was served with deportation orders. while the orders 
were supposedly for a four-year-old marijuana conviction in great britain, what 
lennon didn't realize was that nixon was personally driving the effort to have 
him deported.

a 
nixon-ruby connection
 this fbi-document of 1947 recommends that "one jack rubenstein of chicago" 
should not be called to testify for the committee on unamerican activities, for 
he is working for congressman richard m. nixon. according to the warren 
commission, ruby had no connections with oswald, organized crime or the 
government. no wonder the header reads "this is sensitive".                 

 
william f. pepper - an act of state - the 
execution of martin luther king 
 so we got this case before judge swearingen, who was not in 
good health. we tried the case in 1999 for 30 days: 70 witnesses, 4,000 pages of 
transcript that today is up on the website of the king center -- 
thekingcenter.com has all of the testimony of this. [5] and for the first time 
under oath in any assassination's case in the history of this country, or 
perhaps any other, there is the complete picture of how martin luther king was 
killed. there is every answer to every question. there is why the bushes were 
cut down the next morning. who cut them down. who asked to have them cut down. 
there is every piece of information there. for history more than anything else. 
it took this jury 59 minutes to come back with an award and with a verdict on 
behalf of the family against jowers and known and unknown conspirators in the 
government of the united states, the state of tennessee, and the city of 
memphis. the family felt and feels vindicated. they feel comfortable that they 
know now how it happened and why it happened. the reasons were all laid out.

aircraft arrived at 9 a.m. eighteen operational warships, including four 
battleships, were sunk or heavily damaged; 188 aircraft were destroyed. 2,403 
americans were killed, among them 68 civilians, and 1178 were wounded.

  

 the taking of america 
 1-2-3
 
the taking of america has been both a simple 
and a very complex process. it has not been the result of a coup d'etat, 
although some aspects of the process resemble a coup. it has not been a process 
similar to the dictatorship takeovers in germany, italy and other fascist 
regimes. it has not been a process like the communist "uprisings" in russia, 
hungary and other eastern european countries. 
                    
  
eisenhower's farewell address
 
my fellow americans:

godspeed. i pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity 
for all.
