countdown to mam



what started out as a small get together to raise money for charity in 1994, has evolved into one of the top celebrity pro-ams in the country. thanks to the commitment of hootie & the blowfish, the mam has generated millions of dollars for childrenâs educational programs and the south carolina junior golf program.
					        darius, dean, mark and soni remain true to their philanthropic roots in hosting this one-of-a-kind event.
the mam is open to the general public.
