2024's handy headliner: the bar-kays 



it’s the return of the mack himself!  larry dodson, the famous lead vocalist of the bar-kays is coming back to the shoals and he’s bringing the world famous bar-kays with him!  that’s right, memphis will just have to miss them for a minute because the bar-kays are headlining the w.c. handy music festival! from stax records to stages worldwide, the bar-kays have kept us on the dance floor with songs like shake your rump to the funk, hit and run, move your boogie body,  holy ghost, sexomatic, too hot to stop, attitudes, she talks to me with her body, freak show on the dance floor (complete with a boa constrictor!), son of shaft, and return of the mack.  they racked up twenty-three singles on the r&b charts in an eleven year span, and those were just some of their songs.  they’ve had songs charting from the sixties up until today.  their music has been featured in movie soundtracks, sung and sampled by other artists, and can be heard on radio around the world. larry is also a solo artist, affectionately called “uncle larry”, and has made a  name for himself in the southern soul genre.  don’t miss the chance to move your own boogie body because a bar-kays show with an opening by the shoals area’s local star lorinda “pinky” warren pryor is just too hot to stop!
