Â treecycle's philosophy: education and access to a wide range of recycled, compostable and biodegradable products we want to educate the public on the importance of using eco-friendly products & provide access to a wide range of products.don't be fooled most recycled paper products on the market labeled "recycled" contain little or no post consumer waste(pcw) paper, only wood chips and mill scraps. these "recycled" paper products do little to address the environmental concerns of deforestation and landfilling reusable waste paper. trees should be cut down to make wood and paper should be made back into paper instead of landfilling it. the "real" recycled is post consumer waste(pcw) which is paper used once and taken to recycling centers and then mills to be made back into paper. pcw is not mill scraps and high pcw products is the sustainable and most environmental choice. throughout you'll see pcw, an acronym for post consumer waste or pcc (post consumer content).for recycling to work there must be demand for the products made from recycled materials - studies point to "lack of demand" as a major factor hampering efforts to recycle waste paper. america continues to landfill recycled paper while cutting down trees to make paper. treecycle's motto is "the other half of recycling" because recycling is a loop. we specialize in biodegradable paper products with the highest percentage of post-consumer waste.our choices as consumers do make a difference!close the loop!
