awakening affection for god and each other.



our mission


















          and over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. - colossians 3:14.
        

          |
        

          two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: if either of them falls down, one can help the other up. - ecclesiastes 4:9
        

          |
        

          above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. -  1 peter 4:8 
        

          |
        

          …a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. - genesis 2:24  
        

          |
        

             let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. - proverbs 3:3 
        

          |
        

             so they are no longer two, but one flesh. therefore what god has joined together, let no one separate. - matthew 19:6

"carl and heather present" is our podcast where a songwriter and a scientist (that’s us!) dive into the humor, insights, and challenges of staying married to someone completely different—and still being in love. after 25 years of navigating conflict, resolution, and everything in between, we’ve decided to talk openly about our journey, how we’ve made it work, and how we keep finding reasons to stay together. tune in for carl’s world-class humor and heather’s relentless ability to stay unimpressed.
