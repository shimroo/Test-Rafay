welcome to the arcade restoration workshop! 
do you have an arcade related web site and want a link from here? submit it!
 
i figured after 14 years, it was time for another face lift and rewrite of the web site.  
 
with the rewrite, i've decided to expand the scope of the information my web site has to offer.  i created 3 databases that allow people to search for pcb's, parts, and repair logs.  in addition to that, i've added the ability for anyone that wants to contribute to those database the ability to sign up and start contributing.
 

over the years as our memories start to get worse, or games start failing more frequently, we need a place to go to search for the information we need.  i'm hoping that the arcade restoration workshop will eventually become that place.   
 
please consider signing up and help contribute today!
 
i hope you enjoy the new look and all the new features of the site!   if you have any feedback, you can send me an email.
 
are you an arcade collector living in arizona?  
if so, jump over to the forums and sign up!

galaga died







so my galaga died today...
 
i'm not sure if it's coincidence or related, but i was turning the power off on my defender by the power switch under the control panel at the exact time it failed. the switch was a bit tough to toggle so it was like in the half way position when it happened. both games are on the same circuit.
 
when i hooked the pcb up to the bench the ps was freaking out, voltage and current were jumping all over the place and the oc an ov protections were kicking in.
 
i then just started lightly tapping on the tops of chips and that fixed it. so now i'll spend today replacing all the sockets and cleaning up any corroded chips.

kickman restoration/preservation started







restoration/preservation has begun on my kickman. it's not a full restoration, but more of a preservation of what is there.  i like trying to keep things as original as possible.  with that in mind, i can take a few chances on this one as t

two new games!







yes, like i need more games... i picked up an atari video pinball (1978) and a galaga at an auction today.  in all the years of collecting, i've never owned a galaga, but it's probably the most requested game.  so now i can say "why yes, yes i do have one..."
