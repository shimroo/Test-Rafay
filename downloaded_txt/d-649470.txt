a good early spring tip for catching those big bull bluegills is
using artificials. the lure i like best is a small crawfish type
of lure, we throw them as close to the shore as we can without
getting snagged up and spooking them bull gills which are
stagging in shallow water and getting ready for spawning .
the females are still in deeper water at this time and don't
move in until the males have finished there rituals of power
struggles with the smaller males so they can get the best spots
for building a nest and attracting the girls. they are ready to
attack anything that enters their space. please release these
guys to spawn another day which will actually give you

it 
is better to be a liar than to have never fished bluegill's at all





foxylady's page 
bluegill fishing facts 
please release most of the large (3/4 lb or bigger)
bluegill that you catch. 
research has found that these bluegill are actually a
larger strain of bluegill that has developed over 
many years due to the breeding habits of bluegill. if
you remove too many of the big gills, the smaller 
strain males will dominate and spawn a smaller species
and you will only have small gills  left to catch. 
the large gills will be gone for many many years until
the next large strain evolves. 
it has been said that you can't over fish a lake of
bluegill.....wrong the facts show otherwise. 
just take a few for bragging-the smaller 0nes are
better eating.
