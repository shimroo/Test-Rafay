about rwjf




how we work


















we take bold leaps to transform health in our lifetime and pave the way, together, to a future where health is no longer a privilege, but a right. 















we do this by:


funding innovative and time-tested strategies to create lasting change for health equity 
creating space for health practitioners, community leaders, and researchers to work collectively to shift national conversations about health 
supporting evidence that deepens and shifts our understanding of health and wellbeing 
promoting policies and practices that challenge our institutions to be more equitable and effective for all of us 
cultivating leaders who work individually and collectively across sectors to address health equity 
catalyzing more equitable approaches to developing and investing in communities 
































our organizational structure
we recognize there are many ways to transform health in our lifetime. 
our grantmaking aligns with our goals and we assess the effectiveness of our work through research, evaluation, and learning. 


























learning & evaluation


evaluation is a cornerstone of our approach to philanthropy. we believe deeply in the value of sharing key insights from our grantmaking—what worked, what didn’t, and why. learn how we apply key findings to our work.




how we learn





















evidence and data


we work to expand our nation's evidence base on what can help us achieve health equity faster and together. we recognize that equitable data collection and analysis is necessary to dismantle barriers to health equity.

public health advocacy & policy


we are committed to advancing the policies, practices, and systems changes that can dismantle structural barriers to wellbeing. we take the long view and focus on efforts that have a lasting impact on systemic, generational change.

new jersey: our home state


our roots are in new jersey. our home state is much to be proud of, yet there are still persistent gaps in health and health equity. working alongside others, we are striving to close these gaps and champion communities across our home state.
