then abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall sarah, that is ninety years old,
            bear? ... therefore sarah laughed within herself, saying, after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure, my lord being old also? --genesis 17:17; 18:12






























a warm welcome to
            shelaughed.com!

well, i wasn't quite as old as sarah but this grandma could identify with her in july of 2001 when we had some amazing news. the lord definitely had a "change" in mind for me but it wasn't the one i suspected --and yes, i laughed, too! (so did everyone else when we announced our joyful news!) 

now even as i type i have a precious little bundle of joy snuggled up next to me, sound asleep. words can't convey the depth of my love and appreciation for her; not a day goes by that i don't thank the lord for so radically changing our lives with a brand new baby in our "mid-life"! he is so marvelous and full of amazing plans for our lives if we will just trust him.


the purpose of this site is to:


1.         encourage you in the lord!

            2.         remind you of the many joys of pregnancy after forty.

            3.         keep you focused on god's word and his positive promises.

            4.         share helpful practical tips and positive testimonies.

            5.         connect you with other older moms -you are not alone!


what you will not find on this site:


negative, fearful, or discouraging comments about having babies after forty! (after all, can the lord truly be trusted in this area or not? the answer to this is unequivocally yes!)


statistically
            speaking...
from
            the national center for health statistics:
of
            the 4,058,814 babies born in the united states in 2000,
452,057
            were to women 35 to 39
90,013
            to women 40 to 44 
4,349
            to women 45 to 49
255
            to women 50 to 54.  
previous
            generations saw even higher birthrates for older moms -- for
            instance in 1960 the birthrate for women 40 to 44 was more than
            twice the current rate. 
these
            days more first babies are being born to older mothers, with women
            over age 30 accounting for 24 percent of all first-time mothers in
            2000. more twins and triplets are being born to older mothers, with
            multiple birthrates rising steadily for women over 40 and 45. in
            2000, 40 percent of all births to women 50 and older were twins or
            triplets. 
according
            to the guinness book of world records, the oldest spontaneous
            pregnancy in modern times occurred in a woman who delivered when she
            was aged 57 years, 120 days.
bottom
            line: it's the lord who opens and closes the womb and if he
            wants to bless you with a baby, he can do it regardless of your age!
            just remember sarah.
