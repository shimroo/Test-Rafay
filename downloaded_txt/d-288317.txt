real estates sales

pasley realty was established in 1995 as pasley realty and incorporated in 2006.  we are proud of our heritage as one of the very first real estate companies or agents to have a web presence dating back to 1995.  at pasley realty inc we asked ourselves what kind of agent do we want to be?  our answer was simple, an agent with integrity, professional, ethical and providing individual service to our selected clientele.  we are dedicated to you our client, and take our fiduciary duty of putting your financial interest ahead of our own very seriously. we are not afraid to say, perhaps selling at this time is not your best or only choice and then discussing the options.    you are not one of hundreds of clients we see every year, you are our neighbor and our treasured client, and a unique individual who is treated with respect, caring and our full attention.







i am semi-retired and am working with a terrific agent melissa gatoff to handle all future business in co-listing with me. you can contact her directly at melissa.gatoff@splahrealtygroup.com​
