a former president of the brain injury association of massachusetts, frequent lecturer on legal issues and brain injury, and published author on the subject, he has in-depth experience in brain injury

ways: motor vehicle accidents, sporting accidents, acts of violence and industrial accidents. those who survive a tbi often face long-term effects â physical, cognitive, psychological and/or intellectual â and 500,000 people suffering a tbi will face extended hospitalization. even a so-called âmildâ traumatic brain injury can cause a loss of function that can be disruptive or even devastating.david dwork understands the complexities facing the survivors of tbi, and has helped numerous brain injury survivors and their families. he has obtained favorable results in his areas of practice, which include wrongful death, infants and birth injuries, sports and concussions, premise liability and auto accidents.if you or a loved one has suffered a traumatic brain injury, david dwork is the massachusetts attorney who concentrates his law practice on tbi and has the vast experience necessary to get the best results and the compensation your family deserves. to speak to david about your case, you can contact us online or call 617-973-5024.attorney david dwork has had over 40 years of experience handling complex personal injury cases, with a particular focus on traumatic brain injury cases. because of these years of experience he has considerable knowledge regarding the unique challenges presented by these case, particularly so called âmildâ traumatic brain injuries. while used in a medial context, mr. dwork understands that there is often nothing mild about the consequences of any brain injury, even one resulting in no loss of consciousness or other significant neurological abnormalities. even so called âmildâ traumatic brain injuries can result in significant and life altering physical, psychological, emotional and cognitive impairments. it is important to know the following facts about a traumatic brain injury any degree:-a person does not need to be âknocked outâ or in a coma to have sustained aâ traumatic brain injury. there does not even need to be a direct blow to the head in order to sustain a brain injury. often the neurological examination done at the emergency room and otherwise will be normal. a routine neurological examination is not designed to pick up the type of subtle cognitive impairments that can result from a diffuse axonal injury.-often neuroradiological diagnostic tests may be perfectly normal as these tests are also often unable to pick up the type of microscopic damage that results from an acceleration/deceleration injury to the brain. there are certain classic symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, fatigue, impaired consciousness, confusion, personality changes, impulsivity, etc. associated with post concussion syndrome and even though the plaintiff suffers a âmild traumatic brain injuryâ the resulting cognitive and emotional impairments can have a devastating effect on the personâs ability to function and work.-this is because each individual is unique and the number and location of brain cells injured may be unique for each individual, although there are certain typical symptoms associated with post-concussion syndrome, each individuals symptoms and impairments will be somewhat individualized and effect the individual in different ways.-in an traumaticâ brain injury caused by an auto accident, there need not be a big collision. automobile crashes at 10 mph can exert a force ten times the force of gravity on the skull and are competent to cause diffuse axonal injury. the person himself may not realize that he has sustained a traumatic brain injury or make the association between his symptoms and dysfunction and the accident until weeks or months later.-the traumatic brain injury may not be accompanied with any visible injuries or evidence of trauma to the head or body and the person may be able to continue to function adequately particularly on trained or familiar tasks. it is not until the person is challenged that his or her deficits become recognized that there are often associated hearing or vision difficulties. this occurs despite the fact that there is no injury to the eyes or ears since the injury is to the brain and that part of the brain which controls these functions.-there are often associated vestibular injuries, which result from the same forces that caused the brain injury. emotional sequelae is often associated with traumatic brain injury and just because the person becomes depressed does not suggest that the etiology of the problems are psychological rather than neurological. an injured individual often may be a poor historian as to the amount of time or whether in fact there was a loss of consciousness. many of the treating neurologists or interns that see the person may not diagnose a traumatic brain injury or post- concussion syndrome because they are unfamiliar with and untrained in minor as opposed to more severe forms of brain injury.if you have suffered a traumatic
