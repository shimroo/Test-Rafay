                    03/2014we have purchased a few processors for our concrete recycling operation. we gave ransome what machine we were using.they told us what to use and what to expect in production. 
                    it was pretty dead on.when we received the unit, it went right on the machine with no modifications on our end.  we were happy with the product and ransome.

                    08/2008percy, thank you again for helping me attain the shear with 'creative financing' in such a timely manner.the so50h hydraulic rotating shear has performed well for the miles of 1" to 3 1/2"
                    steam pipe that is to be sheared on the site of the former eliott & williams - roses greenhouses in dover, nh.three greenhouses are 100' x 800' and one 110' x 415' with a combined length of over half a 
                    mile (see photos).  the greenhouses are made of steel pipe, bar stock, angle iron and aluminum extrusions to hold the roofing and siding material.using the so50sh shear has allowed us to maximize the 
                    value of the scrap, and keep a neater and safer site.already, two other jobs in the area are in need of my shearing services, so i will send further updates with more photos and video.enclosed 
                    are some photos and video clips on a dvd of the shear working at the greenhouses.again, thank you for all your help, and your sincere and professional salesmanship.
