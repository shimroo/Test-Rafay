no fancy lighting required. just a white reflector to 
        bounce the light on to the image being copied. what could be easier.
when you copy negatives you can reverse the 
        negative to a positive image either in your camcorder or using the software 
        that came with your pc.
to copy photographs is even easier.

shotcopy is...


shotcopy is the device that will allow you to use your digital
            still  or digital camcorder to quickly and easily copy your slides,
            negatives or prints (up to 4x5) to digital images.   just make 
    sure to
        test your camera before you buy to verify the camera can focus 
        close enough to copy a 35mm slide..







think about 
              it...
flatbed scanner, slide/negative scanner or shotcopy and 
    your hi-def camcorder.





the flatbed scanner was 
    originally designed to scan text but later expanded, with software, to 
    include photographs.  why would you want to copy a photograph while 
    waiting for flatbed scanner wand move slowly across your image when you can capture the 
    same image with one click of your digital camcorder? it is even saved as a digital 
    photographic (jpg) file; no waiting for a scanner conversion.



the slide / negative scanner  
    is simply a digital camera hidden in a box with a slot to receive your 
    slides and negatives. why would you want to buy an expensive, low resolution 
    digital camera in a box that can only do one thing when you can use a 
    multi-function camcorder? 



shotcopy offers you the best of 
    both worlds without the slowness of a flatbed scanner or the expense of a 
    slide/negative scanner. with shotcopy you are only one click away from capturing 
    your photos to your pc  saving you both time and money.



shotcopy
                    design
shotcopy 
                    is designed to allow
                    hi-def camcorders to be mounted on a solid wood base while slides,
            negatives, and prints are held stationary in front of the camera 
                    lens for copying.  it's easy, it's fast and it's fun!  
                    shotcopy has a small footprint that takes up very little 
                    space on your desktop. shotcopy brings you a long way from  the days of bulky copy
                    stands with their hot flood lights.











                    cameras and their functions will morph well into the future



 
                    no more film processing and waiting hopefully for positive 
                    results.  digital camcorders are here to stay as film 
                    takes its place on the shelves of history. 
                    shotcopy is a universal camcorder copy stand that will not 
                    become obsolete as cameras change into the future, like some 
                    other dedicated devices being sold today. don't let your
                    photographic memories be lost in the shuffle of new technology.  bring them
            along with shotcopy and your digital camcorder.  don't leave your
              precious memories behind to fade away and vanish.  revive
              them with shotcopy.  let shotcopy help you keep your family tree
                    from being lost to
              history.
today videotape, cd's and dvd's are 
                    giving way to sd memory chips or digital flash 
                    drives.  storage of information, including pictures 
                    and videos, has reached and surpassed a new paradyne in data 
                    storage capacity history.  and this is especially true 
                    for video and still photography.
what does the future hold - only time 
                    will tell.  who would ever predict we would be where we 
                    are at today during the early days of photography.  
                    based on the past we have little idea what new innovations 
                    we will have for the future of photography.  perhaps in the 
                    future it will not be called photography.







 





 









 


the way we 
                  view and use photographs has changed



gone are the 
                    days when slide projectors and their trays were used to 
                    enlarge slide images on a screen in a darkened room.  
                    now we have digital video projectors and devices that allow 
                    us to  hookup our digital camcorders to our pc's and tv 
                    sets. allowing us to view our home movies and pictures not only at home 
                    but  share them with the world via the internet.  but wait a 
                    minute, how about all your old slides, negatives and 
                    photographs.  
                    shotcopy allows you to use your digital camera to easily 
                    digitize your photos with a click of a shutter.




 











your 
                    slides, negatives and photographs are changing with time




don't let your 
                    old photographs
                    fade away to become damaged or lost to history.  let 
                    the ingenuity of
                    shotcopy and your digital camera help  you bring your 
                    photographs into the 21st century as digital images.  
                    once digitized there is a world beyond your wildest 
                    imagination that awaits you.
 
 
                   



converting 
                    your photos from film to 
                    digital images opens up a whole new world of 
                    possibilities...




once your old photos
                    are digitized you can e-mail them to your friends and 
                    associates; save them
                    to your hard drive; burn them to a cd/dvd; display them on your
                    pc, video projector  or    tv screen.
you will never have to worry again about your pictures
                    fading or turning yellow, or even worse, lost to an accident. 
                    by making copies of your digital photo files you can 
                    inexpensively copy and distribute your memories to your 
                    family, friends or associates for safe keeping.  if lost, 
                    just ask your friends to make a copy of the photo disk that 
                    you sent them.  hello future - here we come!

why shotcopy is better


you have images to copy - why 
          spend your time fumbling around with clumsy trays and using software which 
          you probably already own. with shotcopy there are no trays 
          to fool with.  shotcopy gives you direct access to loading your 
          slides, negatives and prints directly in front of your own digital 
          camera lens for copying with a click of the shutter.  
          no preloading of trays for copying required. then you use the photo 
          editing software that came with your digital camcorder to download and 
          edit the digital photos on your pc.
most cameras in a box have less 
          camera resolution power than your present digital camera. shotcopy 
          keeps up with changes in digital camera technology - its just a matter of 
          swapping out the old for the new camera with shotcopy. don't get stuck with  
          an obsolete camera in a box technology to copy 
          your 
          precious photographs for future generations.
think about it?  why would you buy another 
          camera that is built into a box with less resolution power than 
          your present digital camera?  when you can use your existing 
          digital camcorder to do the work much faster with a click of the shutter?
shotcopy is better by far because it is faster 
          and easier to use.  just load and click - insert the next slide - 
          click.  in no time you will have all those slides, negatives and 
          prints converted to digital images using your own camera ready to download 
          and edit on your pc to share with family, friends and the internet 
          world.
think about it - compare shotcopy with other 
          devices out there and you will realize shotcopy's innovative design superiority over 
          other methods of copying.  plus, shotcopy will not become obsolete as technology moves 
          forward.  shotcopy has been a proven technology since 1997.  
          for all this time shotcopy has been doing the job of converting slides, 
          negatives, and prints with ease - saving untold hours of your precious 
          time.  











shop and compare shotcopy with other 
                converter devices...





you will 
                    find shotcopy is...



¨
faster - no 
                    photo trays to load and unload.



¨
no 
                    waiting for scanner wands and file conversions for each 
                    image.



¨
no manufacturer 
                    proprietary  lens attachments.



¨
no more fixed 
                    intensity of backlighting for slides and negatives of 
                    different exposure densities.



shotcopy makes common sense when compared 
                    to other converter devices...



¨
with shotcopy 
                    you can use  existing photo editing software which came 
                    with your digital camera. why learn a  new software 
                    package just to copy slides, negatives and prints. even 
                    worse, being stuck with dedicated and limited software 
                    features that came with a converter device!



¨
no more  slow scanner technology  designed for scanning documents.



¨
no more cameras 
                    in a box with  limited and easily obsoleted technology 
                    as newer cameras come on the market with higher resolution, 
                    speed and improved storage capability.



make a wise investment in shotcopy that 
                    will last a life time as technology continually moves on 
                    into the future.prove it to
