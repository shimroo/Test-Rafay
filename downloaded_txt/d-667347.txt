our mission is to inspire and foster a love for astronomy 
                by promoting exploration and education. we support members and the community in learning about astronomy, conducting astronomical observations, and 
                capturing the beauty of the universe with astrophotography. engaging programs and initiatives make the wonders of the night sky accessible and 
                enjoyable for everyone.
            
the sacramento valley astronomical society (svas), one of the oldest astronomical societies in the united states, has been inspiring a love for the cosmos since its founding in 1945 by a group of 50 passionate astronomy enthusiasts. today, svas brings together a diverse community of members, from young students and curious amateurs to esteemed college professors and even a world-renowned comet hunter, united by their shared fascination with the night sky.
            
as a nonprofit educational organization, svas is deeply committed to serving the northern california community. through our cherished outreach programs, we spark curiosity and provide opportunities for people of all ages to explore the wonders of the universe. for our members, we offer enriching experiences like telescope workshops, a loaner telescope program, and exclusive star parties under the awe-inspiring sierra skies.
            
at the heart of our society is the svas observatory, nestled on forest service land high in the sierra mountains. this unique facility offers members unparalleled access to the stars, fostering discovery and camaraderie in a setting that inspires awe.

when the science class gets to the subject of astronomy, we can help.

daytime solar viewing. our volunteers, with safely filtered telescopes, will show your students the sun. we have white light and hydrogen alpha filters that reveal solar prominences.
evening star parties. at your location, we can show your class(es) solar system objects and, if conditions are right, deep sky objects.

contact our outreach director - outreach@svas.org
outreach/school star parties





if you just like to learn all you can about astronomy, we get that.

monthly general meetings are a great place to come and learn more about astronomy. we have presentations by our own club members and guest speakers, and the
                            room is
                            filled with like minded enthusiasts to share information.
newsletters. the svas observer is rich with information on upcoming club activities, special events, and articles related to astronomy in general. the svas
                            observer newsletter
                            is published every other month.
public events. check our events calendar for times and locations of our public outreach events, like sunday funday at rusch park, or any celestial event like
                            comets
                            and eclipses.





if you have your own equipment, we've got a place for you.

monthly star parties. we meet at our dark sky site in the sierra's on the saturday nearest the new moon.
share knowledge. we've got members of all levels and some are quite proficient in the hobby. there is usually help nearby at star parties or in our email forum.
outreach. a large part of our mission, and because it's fun, is our public outreach. sharing the joys of astronomy with the public is as rewarding as it
                            sounds.





for the serious observer and imager, check it out.

henry grieb observatory members have access to our observatory on star party nights.

in addition to public events, we make our scopes available by appointment. . .


school star parties

school star parties are events where svas volunteers go out to a host organizationâs planned event with telescopes and educational astronomy presentations and activities. please note that this is an educational, not
                            entertainment,
                            program. for those who qualify we will travel to an appropriate location of your choice within a 30 mile radius of sacramento.
for more information or to book an event, review the star party guidelines





observing trips



yosemite glacier point
in june, july, and august, amateur astronomers often set up telescopes at glacier point on saturdays, and astronomy walks or talks are also be offered in yosemite valley, tuolumne meadows, and wawona.









black butte lake star party

black butte lake is the perfect place for a star party. the skies are dark and comparable to shingletown or adin. access is easy and the roads are excellent. camping and rv sites are clean and spacious. water, restrooms,
                            hot showers,
                            an on-site dump station, wildlife and cooperative rangers all will contribute to a comfortable and pleasant stay. all lights will be controlled by the park rangers in the campground, so light pollution will be at a
                            minimum.
few places in california combine such pastoral character with dark skies and comfortable camping. and in spring, the rolling oak foothills will be carpeted with green grass.
because of limits on the number of people and vehicles, this star party is private. attendance is by invitation only!

amateur telescope making (atm)

lonnie robinson brings you the very best in amateur telescope making (âatmâ). he can help with all aspects of dobsonian telescope building from design and construction to mirror making. he is happy
                            to help with âtelescope tune upsâ involving mirror cleaning, collimation, and adding equipment upgrades.
lonnie's website is: www.hourglass-telescope-mirrors.com





engineering lightweight dobsonian telescopesby lonnie robinsonupdated 2013
john dobson really started something with his dobsonian âdobâ telescope design. he enabled the average amateur telescope maker âatmâ to create a large and very stable telescope with common workshop tools. in this article,
                            lonnie
                            shares his personal thought process and his lightweight dob building adventure with you, hopefully adding some additional fresh ideas to help inspire your new dob telescope project.

celestial events

events like comets, solar and lunar eclipses, meteor showers and planetary oppositions, are great opportunities to get the public exposed to the thrills of astronomy. check our upcoming events to see if something is on the
                            horizon.
