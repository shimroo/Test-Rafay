louisa may alcott
do you love to curl up with little women? do you long to have been an alcott, learning in her father's school or listening to people talk who would someday make history? louisa wrote the books about events from her own childhood, although she changed some details and made up other things. for instance, jo married professor baer, but louisa never did get married. to learn more, try visiting these fun sites:
alcotts and orchard house take a virtual tour of the orchard house that louisa and her family lived in. we believe this is the house featured in little women, although the events didn't actually happen in that house.
hypertext you can read little women online here.
little men read the sequel online at this site.
the alcotts a short biography of her father and of the writing she did at wayside.
