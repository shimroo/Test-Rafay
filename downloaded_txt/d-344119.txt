 spanish family names: family members in spanish 
 
published saturday, december 27, 2008






 here are a list of various family members (relatives) names in spanish. you can use them to say the names of your family members in spanish. the names for male members are masculine and end with the letter "o", and the names for female members are feminine and end with the letter "a". so you replace the last letter in a family name with "a" or "o" depending on if the relative is female or male, respectively. if you are naming a family member  group that has both male and female relatives then you use the  masculine form.names of family relatives in spanishpadre: ______________________ father madre:______________________ mother hermano:____________________ brother hermana:____________________ sister suegro:______________________ father-in-law suegra:______________________ mother-in-law cuñado: _____________________ brother-in-law cuñada: _____________________ sister-in-law esposo, marido:_______________ husband esposa, marida:_______________ wife abuelo:______________________ grandfather abuela:______________________ grandmother bisabuelo: ___________________ great-grandfather bisabuela: ___________________ great-grandmother tatarabuelo: _________________ great-great-grandfather tatarabuela: _________________ great-great-grandmother hijo: ________________________ son hija: ________________________ daughter nieto: _______________________ grandson nieta: _______________________ granddaughter bisnieto:_____________________ great-grandson bisnieta:_____________________ great-granddaughter tataranieto:__________________ great-great-grandson tataranieta:__________________ great-great-granddaughter tío: _________________________ uncle tía: _________________________ aunt tío abuelo: ___________________ great-uncle tía abuela: ___________________ great-aunt primo:_______________________ cousin (male) prima:_______________________ cousin (female) primo carnal, prima carnal:_____ first cousin primo segundo, prima segunda:__ second cousin sobrino:______________________ nephew sobrina:______________________ niece padrastro:____________________ stepfather madrastra: ___________________ stepmother hijastro:______________________ stepson hijastra:______________________ stepdaughter hermanastro:__________________ stepbrother hermanastra:__________________ stepsister medio hermano, hermano de padre, hermano de madre:  _ half brother media hermana, hermana de padre, hermana de madre: _ half sister  some other terms used to say your family members name in spanishpapá ______________________ dadmamá _____________________ mummis padres _________________ my parentsmis papás __________________ my mum and dadconcuñado: ______________________ husband of one's spouse's sisterconcuñada: ______________________ wife of one's spouse's brotherprometido, novio: _________________  fiance, boyfriend, groom prometida, novia: _________________  fiancee, girlfriend, bridefriend and acquaintanceamigo: ______________________ friend (male) amiga: ______________________ friend (female) conocido: ____________________ acquaintance (male) conocida: ____________________ acquaintance (female) related articles:basic spanish and english: days of the week and month of the yearbasic spanish and english words: family names in english and spanishthe vocabulary of the human body in english and spanishspanish speaking countries - countries where spanish is mostly spokenfamily names in english and spanishlanguages by countrieslanguages by countriessaying things in different languagehow to say hello in different languages how to say i love you in different languageshow to say happy new year in different languageshow to say merry christmas in different languageslabels: language, spanish

 how to say hello in different languages 
 
published saturday, may 24, 2008






 hello is a word used as greeting. it is an expression used to greet somebody you meet (or  to answer a telephone call). if you want to say "hello" in a different language then the list below should come in handy.however, verbally expressing (saying) “hello” might not be easy.   trying to pronounce a word in a different language, that you are not acquainted with, can cause you to mispronounce the word. if possible, try to listen carefully to how  people of that language greet each other. the pronunciation of  word can also vary from one region to another within a country. it may, as well, not be the best phrase to say in a given situation. depending on a culture, it may be customary to say “hello” with a hand shake, hug, bow etc.since you are learning to say hello in different languages not all countries are listed. this is because you are not learning to say hello in every different country  (where the language would be the same for one already listed). here are some of the ways of saying "hello" in different languages around the world.languagecountryhelloafrikaanssouthafricagoeiemorealbanianalbaniatungjatjetaamericanusahi/helloarabicn. africa, middleeastmarhabaarmenianarmeniabarevdzesaustralianaustraliag'dayazerbaijaniazerbaijan,iransalaamaleihumbasquespainkaixobelorussianbelorussiadobridzenbengaliindianamoshkarbosnianbosniamerhababulgarianbulgariazdraveiburmeseburma(myanmar)minga la baacantonesechinanei hocambodian(khmer)cambodiajoomreab suorcatalanspainholacherokeen.americao'siyochichewamalawimonichinese(cantonese)chinaneihou machinese (mandarin)chinani haocroatiancroatia,bosniabogczechczech republicahojdanishdenmark,greenlandgoddag,hejsadutchnetherlandshallo, goeiendagenglishenglandhelloesperantoworld-widesalutonestonianestoniaterefarsipersiasalaamfilipinophilippinesmabuhayfinnishfinlandheippa, moifrenchfrancebonjourgeorgiangeorgiagamarjobatgermangermanygutentaggreekgreecegeia souguamguamhafadaihawaiianhawaiialohahebrewisraelshalom,ma nishmahindiindianamastehmonglaos,thailandnyobzoohungarianhungarysziasztokindonesianindonesiasalam,apa kabarinuitcanadakutaairishgaelicirelanddiadhuititalianitalyciaojapanesejapankonnichiwa,ohayokoreankoreaahnyongkhmercambodiajoomreab suorlahuthailand, burmacheh shalalaolaossabai diilatinvatican citysalvelatvianlatviasveikilisuthailand, burmaali ngalithuanianlithuanialabasluxembourgishluxembourgmoienmacedonianmacedoniazdravomalagasymadagascarmanao ahoanamalaymalaysiaapakhabarmalayalamindianamaskarammarshallmarshallislandskasaleliamohawkn. americakwemandinkaw.africakayirabemaorinew zealandkiaoramongolianmongoliasainbainunepalinepalnamastenigeriannigeriabawoninorwegiannorwayhallopaothailand,burmanaaw hsaw hapalaupalaualiipapiamentoaruba,curacao, bonaireconta baipidgin englishpapua new guineagudepolishpolanddziendobryportugueseportugal, brazilolapunjabipunjab,indiasatsri akalromanianromaniasalutrussianrussiaprivetsaad(navajo)n. americaya at' eehsaipansaipanislandhafadaisamoansamoan islandstalofascotishgaelicscotlandciamara tha sibhserbianserbiazdravosetswanabotswanadumela mma (tofemale)setswanabotswanadumelarra (to male)slovakslovakiaahojsloveniansloveniazdravo,zivjospanishs. and c. america,spainhola, bonoestente?srilankansrilankakohomadaswahiliafricajamboswedishswedenhejtagalogphilippinesoytamilindiavanakkam,nalamateluguindianamaskaaramuluthaithailandsawaddeeka (to female)thaithailandsawaddee krab(to male)turkishturkeymerhabaukrainianukraineprivit, dobridenurdupakistanasalamalaykumvietnamesevietnamchaowelshwalesdydddawiganesewiganalreet, orreetxhosasouthafricamoloyorkshireyorkshireay uprelated articles:how to say i love you in different languageshow to say merry christmas in different languageslabels: language
