 sri ramakrishna and swami vivekananda 
 
"can you weep for him with intense
longing of heart? men shed a jugful of tears for the sake of their
children, for their wives, or for money. but who weeps for god? so long
as the child remains engrossed with its toys, the mother looks after
her cooking and other household duties. but when the child no longer
relishes the toys, it throws them aside and yells for its mother. then
the mother takes the rice-pot down from the hearth, runs in haste, and
takes the child in her arms." 
sri ramakrishna paramahamsa 
(dakshineshwar 1884)




"i fervently hope that the bell that
tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell
of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen,
and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to
the same goal."
