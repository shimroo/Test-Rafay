our

 november 25, 2021 

dear children! i am with you in this time of mercy and i am calling all of you 
to be carriers of peace and love in this world where, through me, little 
children, god is calling you to be prayer and love, and an expression of heaven 
here on earth. may your hearts be filled with joy and faith in god; that, little 
children, you may have complete trust in his holy will. that is why i am with 
you, because he, the most high, is sending me among you to encourage you to the 
hope; and you will be peacemakers in this peaceless world. thank you for having 
responded to my call.

medjugorje are the longest known 
							apparitions ever to take place in the history of the 
							world. these messages are a continued cry from our 
							holy mother mary to seek out treasures in the 
							interior life which are far from the ways of this 
							world. prayer is the path to the kingdom. those who 
							practice prayer with the greatest of care will 
							attain the highest perfection in the interior life. 
							do not imagine there are other secrets. in this all 
							our good consists.

all our lady's messages 

in 1989 the founder and webmaster of medjugorje usa went on his 
			first pilgrimage to medjugorje. while in medjugorje, michael 
			experiences a number of astonishing events, untouched by human 
			hands. one of these events took place on top of cross mountain. 
			there, michael and climbing companion (frank, deacon of st. ritas 
			in lowell, ma) met a holy lady named agnes at the stone cross on top 
			of the mountain. agnes gave us both a gift from god. climbing down 
			cross mountain that day, frank said to me; michael she is the most 
			holy person i have ever met. 
the day we were leaving medjugorje to return home, michael met agnes 
			once again, in another set of strange events. agnes walked up to 
			michael giving him a hug and whispered in his ear, michael, it is 
			time for you to go home and spread the message. back home in late 
			september of 1989, michael felt compelled to follow the path given 
			him when agnes whispered in his ear. he talked to home groups, 
			organizations, in churches and to family, friends and strangers, 
			about the miracles of medjugorje. 
through yet another set of strange happenings, michael would attend 
			night courses to lean computer coding. in 1997 his website, 
			medjugorje usa was published on the worldwide web. now in his upper 
			60s, michael has slowed down but continues to spread the message of 
			medjugorje as instructed to do so by holy agnes. since 1989 to 
			currently 2021 michael has spread the message of medjugorje for 32 
			years. to read about all the miracles michael experienced in 1989, 
			visit, my 
			testimony

seek the mercy of god

jesus told saint faustina

"encourage souls to place great trust in my fathomless mercy. let the weak, 
sinful soul have no fear to approach me, for even if it had more sins than there 
are grains of sand in the world, all would be drowned in the immeasurable depths 
of my mercy."

"o jesus it 
			is for the love of you, for the conversion of sinners, and in the 
			reparation for the sins committed against the immaculate heart of 
			mary"




"do not count 
			sufferings, count blessings & pray for those who do not know 
			god, for they have the greatest suffering of all." michael 
			k. jones (founder of medjugorje usa & pow prayer 
			group)


"gods mercy 
			triumphs over the constant, merciless battle between the flesh and 
			the spirit, where these two armies come to clash, within the arena 
			of our soul." 


hail 
				mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee; blessed art thou 
				among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, jesus. holy 
				mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of 
				our death. amen. 




hail mary! hell? no!






"to get something you never 
					had, you have to do something you never did.  




when god takes something from your grasp,
					
he's not punishing 
					you, but merely opening your hands to receive something 
					better. the 
						will of god will never take you where the grace of god 
						will not protect you."
