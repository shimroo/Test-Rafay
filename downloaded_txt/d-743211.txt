formally advanced reflexology techniques (a.r.t).


    

saturday march 29th 2025start time 3.00 pm (15.00 - 1700 hours uk time)duration: approximately two hourscost £40.00 
electrical energy (also referred to as qi, chi, prana, vitality, etc.) forms the foundation of life. it is what drives us; it is what creates life through the electrical spark of conception. the unimpeded circulation of this force is vital — its stagnation leads to death, while its free circulation fosters life.the reflexes of the feet reflect the levels of qi. individuals with high levels typically respond more favourably to treatment than those with lower levels. recognising these indications will help determine the appropriate type of treatment for each specific client.
﻿however, it is also essential to consider the energy state of the practitioner, as this plays a crucial role in enhancing the therapeutic potency of treatments. strategies that practitioners can employ to elevate their levels of qi will be discussed.maintaining and enhancing their qi levels will greatly benefit not only the clients but also their own health.we are so fortunate to have dr. sumi chatterjee join us.she is an exceptionally qualified medical doctor and scientist with a degree in medical biochemistry and a master's degree in pharmacology. the college of medicine awarded her a fellowship for her work. she is also a yoga teacher and is very interested in the body's energy potential and ways to enhance it. she has used her knowledge to overcome a serious health challenge.

    about tony

 member of the london and counties society of physiologists (lcsp)
 began practicing physical therapy and reflexology in 1974
 studied ortho-bionomy with founder arthur lincoln pauls
 after a meeting with the late dwight byers nephew of eunice ingham, he was invited to work at the international institute of reflexology head office in st. petersburg, florida.travelled with dwight and individually giving seminars internationally for over 20 years.
 ran the london office of the i.i.r for ten years.
 maintained a very busy practice in north and central london.
 realising the importance of applying the appropriate contacts to a reflex he developed a system of techniques known as a.r.t. (advanced reflexology training). this later developed into focused reflexology® to better describe the approach. 
 the important factor in reflexology is to recognise that a painful reflex does not necessarily indicate a problem to its related area. it is the nature of the reflex texture which is the key. not being aware of this gives a completely unreliable assessment of the clients reflex status. the concepts of focused reflexology are taught internationally.

reflexology decoded - an online presentation by tony porter                                                                  saturday november 9th                                                      start time 3.00 pm (15.00 hours uk time)                                                      duration: approximately two hours                        cost £40.00                                                                  reflexology is a multifaceted therapy akin to an elusive butterfly that never stays in one place for long; its movements are impossible to predict. i've spent nearly six decades as a reflexologist trying to understand this elusiveness. while i can't claim to have fully grasped it, i have become aware of the reasons behind it. this has given me a deeper understanding of reflexology and transformed the effectiveness of my treatments.                                                                                     my intention for this presentation is to help fellow reflexologists gain a better and clearer understanding of the therapy. this includes becoming aware of how the client’s (and, equally importantly) the practitioner's levels of qi or electricity affect treatment outcomes. strategies for quickly increasing these will be discussed and demonstrated.                                                                  reflexology offers a life-changing opportunity for practitioners willing to challenge conventional norms. this enables a more therapeutically valuable service to clients, which, after all, is the purpose of our work.                                                                                                                    overview of subjects                                                                                                  classical reflexology defined.                                                                                                              the reflexes can tell interesting stories if we know how to interpret them.                                                                                                              understanding the "law" of the "disturbed" reflex.                                                                                                              is it necessary to work all the reflex areas of the feet?                                                                                                              treating what you find and not what you are looking for.                                                                                                              the advantages of splitting a treatment into two phases.                                                                                                              utilising the appropriate types of techniques to match each client's unique reflex status.                                                                                                              the slippery slope: working with an emollient - good or bad?                                                                                                              electricity (life force, chi, qi, etc.) levels in the client and practitioner are a significant factor in treatment response.                                                                                                              the piezoelectric action of reflexology.                                                                                                                                                       i look forward to meeting you at the presentation (early booking is advised).                                                                                                            my best wishes                                                                                                            copyright 2024                                                                                                                         tony porter                                                                  founder focused reflexology/ a.r.t.®

    the energy factor part 2

the energy factor                                                      part 2                                                                                                            reflexology, with its captivating elusiveness, stands out among other manual therapies. its actions are multifaceted, akin to an elusive butterfly that never settles in one place for long. to truly grasp its elusiveness, we must cast our nets wide and develop the ability to discern the subtle changes in the tissues of the reflexes — what i identify as a disturbed reflex.                                                      it's important to note that many reflexologists may not work in a way that allows them to become aware of these changes. however, this presents an exciting opportunity for future exploration, which we will explore in a future article.                                                                                                            a disturbed reflex displays a texture or ‘feel’ that differs from its surrounding tissue. there are various types of textures, from the crystals described by eunice ingham to those with a more subtle identity. once this ability has been developed, the practitioner will become in tune with the energy that gives animation to all life forms. that energy is —electricity.                                                                  the feet are receptors of the electromagnetic energies from the earth. they serve as a two-way communicator between the earth and the brain, not forgetting to and from the therapist. the feet serve as electromagnetic communication centres.                                                      the quote below explains this very well:                                                                                                            ‘each cell in the body is a tiny, complex electrical system which picks up magnetic impulses not only from the atmosphere but especially from the ground. hence the tactile hypersensitivity of the toe tips and sole of the foot is no coincidence, but part of our natural equipment to ‘pick up’ these electro magnetic forces and convey them through the body’.                                                       - james beal nasa’s space centre:                                                                                                            as reflexology practitioners, we need to be aware of the electrical circulation of the body, as well as that of the blood, lymph, and, of course, oxygen.                                                      in ancient cultures, electricity was described as qi, life force, chi, vitality, ka, etc., vital force. in acupuncture, electricity or qi is said to flow in channels (or vessels) known as meridians. in ayurvedic medicine, it is called prana and is said to flow through a complicated network of vessels or channels called nadis, of which there are said to be 72,000.                                                                                                            ‘circulation is life; stagnation is death’, a wise maxim that applies not only to blood circulation but also to electricity. it is a resistance to this energy that creates a disturbed reflex.                                                                                                            my life in reflexology has taught me much about reflexology. one of the most valuable factors is the variation of each client's reflex sensitivity status. this showed that those with a generally dull reflex status were slow responders to treatment, while those with lively and easily detected reflexes would have a strong response. this led me to discover that a painful reflex does not necessarily indicate a problem in its referred pathway. on the contrary, in health, feet should display robust and sensitive reflexes, a sign of high levels of qi or vitality throughout the body. this explains why the reflex status of people with serious or terminal diseases will become less evident as the disease progresses due to the decreasing levels of qi. this is evident in those not receiving analgesic medication.                                                                                                            in addition to the client's energy status, i became aware of my own energy status and how its fluctuations affected my treatments. i would begin most days with an early morning run, but sometimes i extended my running time, and even though i felt good afterwards, something seemed missing from my treatments on those days. clients remarked that my touch felt empty and my treatment lacked its usual effectiveness.                                                      this made me question how the practitioner's qi levels affected treatment outcomes.                                                      my investigation led me to discover that ancient schools of therapeutic knowledge emphasised the practitioner's health as much as the patient’s.                                                                                                            a few years later, during a visit to china, i met a famous acupuncturist who explained the same energy factor. as a point of interest, she told me that working on the feet was deemed bad for the practitioner; for this reason, reflexology was not practised except in public bathhouses for insomnia. (this is for another article). she explained that to build or restore qi; we need to stand barefoot on grass or the earth and breathe the energy up through the feet (from the kidney 1 acupuncture point — an example of the benefits of grounding).                                                                                                            since then, i have discovered much about restoring and increasing the body's qi, which, in my case, always leads to more effective treatments.                                                      i found that jogging for a too long duration, particularly on my treatment days, had a negative impact on the therapeutic effectiveness of treatments.                                                      interestingly, a gym workout with weights did not have the same detrimental effect. it seems that anaerobic resistance exercise can stimulate qi.                                                                                                            strategies to increase qi                                                      since then, the most effective way for me to increase and restore my qi has been the practice of pranayama (the science of breath). (i began this practice many years ago after being diagnosed with having an inherited cardiological issue.)                                                      those who regularly practice breath work will experience the circulation of qi through the body, particularly in the fingertips and toes. in my experience, this energy is shared with the client, giving treatments a touch of magic.                                                      ancient schools of health taught practitioners how to build and maintain good health and vitality for its value in treatments.                                                                                                            some activities which reduce qi                                                      too long duration of aerobic exercise (on treatment days)                                                      lack of sleep                                                      excessive alcohol                        poor breathing                                                      dehydration                                                                                                            some activities to increase qi                                                      breathwork, particularly each morning. (including abdominal breathing, which can be performed in unison with humming — both are great vagus stimulants.)                                                      abdominal massage                                                      splashing the face with cold water is another vagal stimulant.                                                      pilates                                                      meditation                                                      reiki                                                                                                            i have touched a single thread of a vast tapestry of lost knowledge.                                                      i know many practitioners practice my suggestions regularly, some of whom are leaders in this field. i will expand on this subject later in one way or another.                                                                                                            i conclude with this thought: ‘the body distils its own miraculous medicines’ — if given a chance.                                                                                                            my best wishes                                                                                                            tony porter

having an interest in the buddhist and zen philosophy i have some favourite poems and writings.this is one of them and it particularly relates to those of us in the health professions. the human body, at peace with itselfis more precious than the rarest gem.cherish your body, it is yours this one time only.the human form is won with difficulty, it is easy to lose.all worldly things are brief,like lightening in the sky;this life you must knowas the tiny splash of a raindrop;a thing of beauty that disappearseven as it comes into being,therefore set your goal and make use of every day and nightto achieve it.this was written by tsongkhapa who was a 14th century tibetan lama and buddhist.
