about tlc

the tarheel leather club was the first leather/bdsm club in greensboro and has remained true to its leather straps for over a quarter of a century.  our members are in demand as speakers to various organizations presenters at many events throughout the country and judges for several contests.
nine individuals founded tlc on april 1, 1990, in greensboro, nc. those founding members are bill c., kevin d., nick d., richard g., stuart n., michael p., henry p., randy t., and david w.
two of our founding members were among the founders of the triad health project.  two of our members were on the board of directors of the national leather association, three are published authors, and a former member produced the first documentary of a leather club. one formerly headed the southeast leather contest.  tlc now owns and runs the nc bootblack contest, whose winner competes in southeast leatherfest.
in 1991, tlc won the leather journal’s “club of the year” award and a member won both the ” southeast regional man of the year” and “man of the year” awards. in 1993 another of our members won the “southeast regional” award and yet another was awarded “business person of the year” by the leather journal. in 1996 a tlc member was named “regional leather person of the year”. members have held numerous “titles” including mr. leather charlotte, mr. coastal carolina leather, mr. carolina leather, nc leather (3), southeast leather (4), and southeast drummer.
shortly after our founding, we created the “beat jesse campaign” to organize the national leather/bdsm/fetish community to oppose the reelection of jesse helms to the us senate. since then, we have been actively involved in community affairs such as being color guards for local gay pride events, fundraisers for local and regional groups such as aids service organizations, and regional and national groups such as helping with the display of the “aids quilt” and the “march on washington”. in 2001, we became tarheel leather club, inc., a not-for-profit corporation registered in north carolina. tlc is also  one of the founding member clubs of the secc.
tlc does what it can to support our main charity: triad health project – providing funds, manpower, food drives, and supplies when needed.  as a club, we also support the national leather association international(nla-), the names project, and the leather archives and museum.
