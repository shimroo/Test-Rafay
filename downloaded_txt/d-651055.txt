mhanys ceo glenn liebman testified during the new york state office of mental health’s (omh) town hall, which was held on wednesday, december 18, 2024. nearly 2,000 people joined in person or virtually to receive programmatic updates from omh’s leadership, led by commissioner ann sullivan, md, and provide feedback during the public comment period.
glenn focused his remarks on mhanys 10-point plan for enhancing community mental health. the plan recommends increasing investment in the not-for-profit human services workforce, examining ways to bolster recruitment and retention (including retirement equity), enhancing access to care, expanding mental health literacy, and supporting our first responders. check out glenn’s remarks in the town hall recording here (glenn’s remarks commence at approximately 1 hour 19 minutes). omh’s slides, presented during the town hall, are available here.
