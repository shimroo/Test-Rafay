hg and i did not get into a fight and decided to stop working together on i am fashion and started our own blogs instead. (even our mutual friends wondered about it!) we still email each other daily about the intricate details of our lives and  random thoughts we have, and feel extremely empty when the other is away and has  no access to the internet. when i freak out, she is the first person i call and  she is still my maid of honor when i fantasize about my wedding. our reasons for  closing down i am  fashion still stands, though i do think that my later rationalization  of it in this blog is a  better articulation of how we feel.as for us continuing to blog even more regularly than before, i attribute it to the "newness" of our blogs. starting a new blog is like starting a relationship. at the beginning everything is new and exciting as you get to know the other person and watch your relationship grow and mature. every up and every down is a significant moment. then the honeymoon phase eventually wears off and you reach a happy medium, where your relationship becomes a part of your daily life. with any luck, you will live happily ever after in this state with a few surprises here and there to spice up the norm. if not, your relationship will wane and you grow apart, eventually deciding that you are both better off parting ways.clearly i'm in the honeymoon phase. we are starting to explore new things together, trying to figure out what works best for the both of us. every new post is an adventure. every comment and email is exciting. i want to spend every moment of everyday with it, checking on its progress i.e. stalking the traffic, the incoming and outgoing links etc. it's an exhilarating feeling that i'd almost forgotten about!analogy aside, it is heartwarming to read everyone's encouraging comments and to know that we were able to leave a small footprint on some people's lives. we appreciate your support and remember that we've not left the blogging world for good. come visit us some time at our new blogs -(find the links to our new blogs in the post below). we miss you guys!

ohhhh i did something totally insane and spent money on a pair of boots that look like this:yes.  they will be here tomorrow.  wonderful guess "maeve" boots.  kind of gothic but i can't wait to wear it with my chiffon dress with tights and leg warmers, a black blazer, and some crazy coloured scarf.so now for some outfits that i would gladly wear.  because we all have lacroix, moschino and schouler lying around in our closets.so excited.  so in love.but not nearly as excited or as in love with the fact that barack obama is now our president!!

       the dvf keva dress

       

    


i always knew that ms. von furstenburg was a genius with the wrap dress, but i thought that my one printed blue dvf classic wrap dress would be enough to quench my thirst for dvf. unfortunately, she has proven me wrong with the keva dress.i first caught a glimpse of it online window shopping on shopbop. it had only just gone on sale and i thought, aww what a pretty dress. then the other day, i saw it at a department store and i must say, it looks even better in person! naturally i simply had to try it on, even though the only one on the rack was about 2 sizes too big. and it felt absolutely beautiful. it is made out of this wonderfully flowy chiffon material that moves with you as you swirl. most of the time with these kind of dresses, the chest area would be too big for me. but from the looks of it, with the right size, it promises to fit well on me (or so i imagine). and best thing of all? with this print, this is the perfect dress for spring. the color is dark enough that you can pair it with tights for colder weathers. but the material and design is just light enough that it will still be great for summer! the print is also not so recognizable that it will be over next season. how awesome is this dress?unfortunately for me, i analyze too long and now they are sold out on shopbop (it was half price!). i've already checked the dvf website, saks and neiman marcus. but alas, it looks like this dress is lost to me. i definitely need to keep my eye out for something similar in the next collection!oh and happy 2009 everyone!image source: shopbop
