								dec 2022i live in hernando ms and in 2020 
								invested in 7 new houses for rentals in 
								huntsville al. bought them at $200,000 and now 
								they appraise for $325,000- $350,000. i 
								fortunately was led to terry from reviews 
								online. i interviewed 4 different companies 
								before i chose her. she has from day one been so 
								impressive. so hard working. she thoroughly vets 
								the applicants; i have never had a house vacant, 
								except in between renters; and have never had a 
								missed rent check. she knows the market and gets 
								top rent for me.  she jumps right in on 
								arranging repairs and always checks with me 
								before she orders the work. she can be tough, if 
								need be, but basically is accommodating and 
								wants to keep renters happy.  i obviously highly 
								recommended her.... vicki mauney

																		laura 
								fursdon - i worked with terry first as my 
								property manger while i was working in japan for 
								3 years and then as my realtor to sell my 
								property. terry has always looked out for my 
								best interests! she is honest and ethical and 
								takes pride in the work she does!
																		it has 
								been a pleasure to work with her and i've 
								already recommended her to others!
								
								if i 

								was staying in the alabama area, i wouldn't 
								work with any other realtor! i wish she worked 
								in texas too!!

								terry helped us sell our house recently in 
								heritage provence, and it was a phenomenal experience. 
we moved to another 
								state prior to listing the house, and terry 
								handled everything--from working with local 
								contractors on repairs and house prep, to 
								showings, to lawn care, and everything 
								in-between. her spot-on advice in how to prep 
								our home and her excellent negotiating skills 
								landed us a contract higher than our planned 
								asking price within just a few days of listing. 
								she was hyper-responsive and patient all through 
								the process, and her advice was always 
								practical, straightforward, and very, very good. 
								i would recommend terry to anyone, with great 
								confidence. if you're lucky enough to get terry 
								as your agent, know that you're in the best 
								possible hands. thank you terry!!!




																		eric zheng ~i 
																		rented a 
																		house 
																		from 
																		terry 
																		when our 
																		family 
																		moved to 
																		madison, al 
																		from 
																		china in 
																		2012. 
																		she 
																		impressed 
																		me as 
																		being 
																		such a 
																		professional 
																		broker, 
																		so i 
																		decided 
																		to take 
																		her as 
																		my 
																		property 
																		manager 
																		when i 
																		bought a 
																		house 
																		for 
																		lease. 
																		facts 
																		proved 
																		that she 
																		is such 
																		an 
																		excellent 
																		property 
																		manager. 
																		she got 
																		tenants 																		
																		for us quickly. 
																		she is 
																		very 
																		responsible 
																		for both 
																		landlords 
																		and 
																		tenants. 
																		i think 
																		she is 
																		the 
																		right 
																		person 
																		not only 
																		for me 
																		but also 
																		for you!

																		to whom 
																		it may 
																		concern:


																		it is my 
																		pleasure 
																		to 
																		recommend 
																		terry 
																		lampiasi 
																		as a 
																		property 
																		manager 
																		and a 
																		realtor.
																																		a year 
																		and a 
																		half ago 
																		, terry 
																		helped 
																		my wife 
																		and i 
																		purchase 
																		a  home 
																		and she 
																		immediately 
																		had our 
																		townhome 
																		leased 
																		without 
																		any 
																		break in 
																		income. 
																		we were 
																		concerned  
																		about 
																		paying 
																		two 
																		mortgages 
																		while 
																		waiting 
																		on a 
																		renter 
																		for our 
																		townhome; 
																		however, 
																		we 
																		closed 
																		on our 
																		house 
																		the end 
																		of 
																		august 
																		2012 and 
																		our new 
																		tenant 
																		was in 
																		our 
																		townhome 
																		the 1st 
																		day 
																		of sept 
																		2012.
																		



																		both the 
																		purchasing 
																		of our 
																		new home 
																		and our 
																		first 
																		time 
																		experience 
																		with 
																		rental 
																		income 
																		was easy 
																		with 
																		terry's 
																		knowledge 
																		and 
																		professionalism.
																		











																		we are 
																		happy to 
																		have her 
																		on our 
																		side.


																		yours 
																		sincerely
