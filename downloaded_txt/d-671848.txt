bet blocker 

beyonce will be performing at this year’s bet awards along with kanye west, jay-z and the dream. but it looks like matthew aka joe jackson 2.0 got some more tricks up his sleeves b/c letoya luckett is scheduled to perform as well...
according to blogger necolebitchie someone who wanted to remain anonyous hit her up stating that matt is playing “big bad wolf” again and is doing everything in his power so that ex-destiny child member letoya luckett does not perform. they say he is threatening to pull beyonce from the show if bet includes letoya in the line up.

now it will be interesting to see if bet bitches out and folds to 2.0's demands.... hell and i thought ahmadinejad was a beast....

body rock   (source) if yall havent seen mel b's bod lately.... well take a look and be ashamed ladies... and gents!... she is the mother of 3 and here i am lookin like i gave birth to 8 sets of octuplets... but i digress... this aint about me.... recently, she gave an interview to a uk mag where she discusses how she got in such extreme shape..... now if she woulda had all those hard muscles b4 she had eddie's baby they mighta been able to work something out... yall know how he likes some hard muscles to hold (sorry johnny). mel states, "i’m honestly not body-obsessed - i can’t be with three kids and a husband. my husband likes my muscles, but then he’s seen me every which way over the past eight years - including when i put on 42lbs after my last pregnancy and he always loves my body. in fact, on top of all my exercise, i have sex with him five times a day - maybe that has something to do with it. i have to admit, i’m a nymphomaniac with him. it’s sexercise!"

weezy f baby's babies 

question of the day... who the hell keeps f'n lil wayne? so reportedly lauren london found out that nivea is preggers by wayne too... blogger freddy o got the info:

"i was told yesterday lauren london was at lost for words today after finding out that her baby daddy was expecting another child yesterday. lauren who is almost 6 months pregnant didn’t know anything about nivea pregnancy, and found out via mediatakeout.com (go figure) and was outraged.

like every other star these days, she took to her twitter page to express how she felt. but after speaking to a family friend left the topic alone. she then decided to spend the day with her family and close friends. lauren told her friends that she is worried if her career is over as a result of these issues. as we all know lauren is on the pinnacle of black hollywood as the face of sean john and reoccurring role in the remake of beverly hills 90210 on the cw. a reliable source stated that wayne doesn’t want anything to do with lauren.

today nivea called ryan cameron’s and confirmed that she is indeed pregnant with a boy. in fact, both of them are pregnant with wayne’s sons. this is a really bad situation, considering that she is knocked up and the baby daddy is in love with someone else. lauren london can have any man in the world but she chooses to get with an engaged man… is the recession effecting men too!!!! this makes wayne about 4 babies up and 4 baby mamas down. i guess it is true about wayne ” he can f*&^k any girl in this world”.

another 1 bites the dust 

after dodging breakup rumors for months, usher and his wife tameka foster have reportedly called it quits.


several media outlets are reporting that usher filed divorce papers in atlanta this morning.


“the grammy winner has been living apart from his wife for nearly a year after almost two years of marriage,” an insider tells in touch.
“usher’s primary concern is for his children. he is a great father and just wants to do what is right for them.”


the couple has reportedly been having problems for a really long time. last november usher rushed to tameka’s side after she had complications with plastic surgery in brazil. apparently he “had no idea that she was there to have surgery.” 
(source)
ummmm did we all not see this coming? maybe now he can sell an album again....
