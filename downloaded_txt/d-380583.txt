why we love what we do



seasonal area supervisor, aquatics
lexi
"i started in 2017 and i've worked in rides, admissions, entertainment and aquatics. i was eventually promoted to a team lead, then a supervisor and now i am an area supervisor. i absolutely love my job and i wouldn't trade it for anything to be honest."


manager, food and beverage
alex
"i had season passes every summer, so i decided to apply. when the summer's in full gear, the environment that you're surrounded by with the guests, the rides going and all the associates working around you doing their jobs, the energy that it brings is really exciting."


area manager, admissions
yolanda
"i saw they were hiring guest service reps, so i thought - ok, this is pretty cool and i applied. i really enjoyed it and am still here! the best thing is the relationships that i've made with my coworkers and guests. a lot of people, clock out of a job and then go home, but here you clock out and you get to go to an amusement park, which is pretty awesome."
