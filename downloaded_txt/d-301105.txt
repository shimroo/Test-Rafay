cyber bullying - how can we keep our children from becoming victims?





cyber bullying can be extremely dangerous and has now lead to many children to grow to be so affected that they ultimately committed suicide. they may be quite often referred to as bullycide victims. is your child a victim of internet cyber bullying?remember when we were kids and how the schoolyard or neighborhood bully would make life miserable for some poor kid who he targeted for his daily amusement? things sure have changed with the development of the internet. the internet bully has arrived and is rapidly becoming a major problem and risk for our kids.this type of harassment can take many forms. it is usually perpetrated by a child of similar age to your own. it could be one of their peers that they know from school or a neighbor. however it can also be an adult who is looking to do harm to your child.there are many forums and chat rooms our kids love to frequent on the internet. places like facebook and myspace are very popular with our teenagers. it turns out that according to surveys these types of sites are the main sources of cyber bullying.your teenager could be talking in a forum with other friends and all of a sudden the individual starts harassing your teenager and making comments to embarrass and humiliate them in front of their friends and peers. they may make false allegations and claims to discredit your kid.many times the cyber bully may log into a site using a false identity, the identity of your child, and make statements or actions that others think your teenager is responsible for.this person can also post images of your child they may have gained access to through friends or previous physical encounters with your child. kids will be kids and sometimes pictures are taken without concern that they may be seen out of context.of course with graphic programs like photoshop the cyber bully could easily fake a picture using the head of your child and the body of another individual to compose a picture image that could be extremely embarrassing and harmful. it is very easy to do with these powerful image editing programs.it has been shown through surveying youth that a third of our children fall victim of cyber bullying. many times parents are totally unaware because the surveys also show that 41% never tell anyone like parents or friends when they go off the internet. they are more likely to confide with another friend on the internet.how do we know if they are victims of this type of abuse? if your kid is being constantly attacked by a bully while online they could easily become one of the many victims that become so depressed that they may consider or actually commit suicide. if they do not tell us how can we help them?there are software programs that will allow us to monitor what is going on when our children are online. with the use of these programs you can, without your child ever knowing, make sure they are not falling victim to internet cyber bullying or any of the other various dangers present on the net.

eblaster mobile - blackberry spy software





spectorsoft is proud to extend its award-winning eblaster blackberry spy software to mobile smartphones. today, the company is launching eblaster mobile for blackberry.eblaster mobile installs on any blackberry owned by you or your company. the software captures both sides of email conversations, both sides of text messages (in a conversation/thread format), and keeps a log of every call placed and received. it emails all of this information to you in a concise activity report, as often as you like.for business owners: although corporate email and pin messages are typically archived on a secure server, personal e-mail messages (including @aol, @gmail, @hotmail and @yahoo) are not. this represents a critical security gap for it departments — because it’s virtually impossible to detect or prove instances of data theft, abuse, or policy violations when employees send confidential or sensitive information in personal e-mail and text messages from their blackberry.for parents: staying ahead of a child’s online communications is challenging, which is why software products like spector pro and eblaster are widely used by parents and law enforcement agencies worldwide – and recently earned 2010 mom’s choice awards and the national parenting seal of approval. but when a child carries an internet-enabled smartphone, it’s impossible to know if they’re getting carried away in text and email, or making mistakes that could jeopardize their well-being and safety. as parents, reviewing the monthly statement will reveal who and how much they’ve been calling or texting, but not what’s being typed in text and email messages.eblaster mobileview the original article here

as chatroulette expands, parents can rest easy with spector pro and eblaster





as an update to our recent warning about the dangers of chatroulette, the site just launched two features called localroulette and channelroulette, designed to bring strangers closer together. if you’re not familiar with chatroulette, this “web cam-based”  website connects users with a random stranger — at which point they can  decide to chat on camera and in a text window, or hit the “next” button  to reveal another stranger.  in may 2010, the site boasted 1.3 million  visitors – 89% of whom are male and criticized for exposing themselves sexually on camera to strangers, including kids who log on for fun. spectorsoft blocks all chatroulette websites — even personalized ones with spector pro or eblaster  installed, if kids do choose to play this dangerous game, you’ll be  alerted and given the opportunity to cut off potential predators before  they enter your kid’s world.  both products feature built-in website  “blocking” capabilities to quickly block access to websites you  determine to be inappropriate, as well as people they shouldn’t be  chatting with. although this may sound daunting for parents to do anything about, if you’re a spector pro or eblaster customer, you can rest easy.

tech that combats employee fraud





tech that combats employee fraudtools that monitor web use and computer keystrokes can help companies cut down on worker malfeasance but can't catch every would-be crookby rachael kingthomas vanderbilt communications employees like to kid each other that they're being watched by big brother. but the software used by their employer to monitor their computer use is no joke. the atlanta marketing and advertising company makes no secret that it's keeping tabs on every web site they visit, every keystroke they tap, every instant message they send—even the contents of the messages on their personal hotmail or gmail accounts. "i don't feel like i'm spying on my employees," says thomas vanderbilt, president and chief creative officer of the firm, whose past and current clients include high-profile brands such as coca-cola (ko) and starbucks (sbux).vanderbilt signs confidentiality agreements with his clients and needs to be sure that contractors and young twentysomething employees aren't sharing, say, images from celebrity ad photo shoots or other closely held information. the software, made by spectorsoft, proved especially valuable when it sniffed out dummy expense reports being created by a new accounts payable clerk.instances of fraud rise during recessions as employees become financially desperate or disgruntled—or both, experts say. that fraud can range from abusing expense accounts to skimming and check tampering. for example, nearly two-thirds of 1,280 executives said they expect accounting fraud perpetrated by both employees and executives to increase during the next two years, according to a deloitte survey released in january.hard times bring more fraudbesides financial fraud, companies find less insidious but still costly forms of abuse such as employees spending long, production-sapping stretches on facebook or youtube (goog).to help avoid cases of worker fraud, companies are increasingly using monitoring and tracking software. "employee fraud definitely increases in economic hard times," says frank mckenna, co-founder and chief fraud strategist of basepoint analytics, a firm that offers fraud consulting and software for banks, mortgage lenders, and credit-card companies. the primary reason is that employees no longer have access to credit or the ability to continue a certain lifestyle and a desperate few will resort to wrongdoing. also, employees tend to feel less loyal to companies as they watch layoffs happen. in some cases, layoffs can actually remove people who served as watchdogs against abuse by their colleagues.at one fortune 500 company in the medical industry, a woman claimed to have cancer and said she was taking sick days for her treatments. turns out that she was actually going for spa treatments and charging them to her corporate credit card. the expenses appeared to be legitimate travel-related expenses since she was going to a hotel-based spa. the situation was recently flagged by auditing software from oversight systems that compared the detailed charge records from american express (axp) with attendance data.keystrokes can raise red flagsbasepoint's mckenna says that in order to catch fraud, businesses have to look at behaviors that aren't typical of employees in certain jobs. one way to do that is to monitor keystrokes.in a former position, mckenna managed internal investigations at a bank. he found that on a monthly basis he could expect anywhere from one to four reps out of 3,000 that had access to customer credit-card accounts at a particular call center to commit internal fraud. "we had to look at what they were doing on the computer and compare that to what nonfraud employees were doing," he says. "the keystroke behavior was much different." some reps might search on particular names over and over again, while others might go into a customer's account five or more times a day.software that monitors keystrokes can potentially find those red flags.in research published early last year, about 45% of companies surveyed tracked content, keystrokes, and time spent at computer keyboards in 2007, up from 36% in 2005, according to the 2007 electronic monitoring & surveillance survey of 304 companies by the american management assn. and the epolicy institute. in addition, about 66% of employers surveyed say they monitor web surfing and block connections to inappropriate web sites, a group that often includes adult sites, game sites, and social networking sites.imv projects, an engineering, procurement, and construction management company in the oil and gas industry, estimates that each of the company's 650 employees recouped about 10 hours of work per year after the company installed software from spectorsoft to monitor web usage and time spent chatting on instant messaging. "our primary goal is to see where everyone is going," says steven terenta, network manager for imv projects. "the only time we look at one employee is when a supervisor asks us to check something out." the company now blocks access to facebook except during the lunch hour. imv projects estimates the increased productivity amounts to at least $195,000 per year.hotlines can helptechnology can turn up suspicious activity, but it shouldn't be seen as the only solution, experts say. much still depends on people noticing any activity that's out of the ordinary. "most fraud is uncovered by accident," says heriot prentice, director of standards and guidance at the institute of internal auditors. and the reporting of that fraud often relies on fellow workers who serve as whistleblowers. that's why experts say that something as low-tech as an anonymous hotline can be beneficial.best buy (bby) lets employees report fraud by phone and via the internet. in fact, employees helped uncover fraud that led to a best buy vendor-relations manager pleading guilty in january to receiving kickbacks from a computer parts supplier in an alleged fraud scheme that best buy says cost it $31 million over four years."there's been a spike in the reporting of fraud. more people are coming forward recently," says kathleen edmond, chief ethics officer at best buy. still edmond says she's not sure whether fraud itself is on the rise. she points to the possibility that employees may have seen it go on in the past and not reported it. that's changed as the economy has sunk into distress and layoffs have started, she says, adding that employees are more likely to report fellow employees who are trying to get away with something.still, many employees don't welcome employers watching their every move online. that was certainly the case at thomas vanderbilt communications. "in the beginning the employees were very upset; they felt a lack of trust and a lack of respect and that they should have privacy," vanderbilt says. most can now laugh about it, he says. "it takes the negativity away about it when you can joke about it," he says, "but it is a constant reminder that you are being watched."king is a writer for businessweek.com in san francisco.

internet threat in farmington school shows need to monitor teens' web activities





how much do you supervise your teens and/or preteens when they are on the internet? many serious issues can develop when a child of any age is on the internet unsupervised.for example, cyberbullying, predators, pornography and inappropriate postings on social networking sites are all easy for any teen or preteen to get mixed up in via the web. a recent situation occurred at farmington’s warner middle school, where a student who sent threatening internet messages will face disciplinary action in ten days.a concerned parent alerted the school to the threat by calling the principal, mark watson.watson later sent out a notice to parents stating that “police were informed immediately and the building was placed in a classroom lock down for a short time period. at no time was anyone in danger.”the district isn’t revealing details about the threat or the student.estralee michaelson, director of safe schools and student services for farmington public schools, is grateful for parents who are on top of the many issues that their children and teenagers can get into over the internet. principal watson also strongly advises parents and guardians to monitor all online networking web sites, such as facebook and myspace, that children may be involved with.“please continue to remind children never to write anything threatening or harmful,” advised watson.i agree with both the principal and the director of safe schools.i have always watched my teenager’s internet activity and facebook accounts carefully despite their many protests.i could tell you stories about what i have found on there over the years, usually involving their friends posting inappropriate or mean material.i also use a program called eblaster.com, which sends me daily reports on the websites my teens visit, and reports on other internet activity.when i tell people that i do this, many agree that it’s the right thing to do. however, others have strong opinions that children are entitled to more privacy and trust.yet in addition to the other issues i mentioned, a lot of material that a young person posts now may come back to haunt him or her later. some of it never goes away, even after it's deleted.there are even companies now who will help improve online reputations. see how “employers use internet to research candidates.” for more information, see: "school takes precaution following internet threat""employers use internet to research candidates"note: if you would like to receive regular updates on what’s happening in michigan education,  click on the subscribe icon below to sign up for once-a-day spam-free emails.

teens exposed on phones internet





december 29, 2008 - 5:18 pmkim hone-mcmahanakron beacon journalakron, ohio • the tone alerted brian he had received a new photo on his cell phone. as he had done a hundred times, he pushed a button and the picture appeared on his miniature screen.but rather than an image of a friend playing soccer, or a group of his pals making goofy faces, there was a picture of a naked girl.an isolated incident? hardly.brian, who was at a local youth club with friends when this picture showed up, said he had two photos of nude girls forwarded to his cell phone in a month."my friend who sent them to me didn't even know the girls," the akron, ohio, 17-year-old said, adding that he deleted the pictures.it's no secret that boys have been hiding beneath the bed, in the closet or behind the garage to peek at pictures in girlie magazines. but now, technology has the bare breasts of the girl across town to be viewed with the push of a button."if you walk into a school today, i would guess one out of three student cell phones has a nude photo," said sgt. david brown with the summit county, ohio, sheriff's office investigations bureau.the ease of taking and sharing photos with cell phones, as well as the perceived freedom of expression found in social-networking sites such as facebook and myspace, mean that more teens are experimenting with taking sexually provocative images of themselves."i think the girls do it to get attention," brian said.that's a notion supported by jean twenge, author of "generation me" and an associate professor of psychology at san diego state university, who along with colleagues, conducted research that found that narcissism, or self-love, has increased over the years.in addition, authorities believe many teens are more sexually experienced than their parents were when they were kids."when we were younger, we would be lucky to get our first kiss at 13," brown said.sometimes teens will send pictures of themselves or friends; other times professionally shot photos of models make the rounds.and it's not just naked girls showing up on screens."i knew who he was," said 17-year-old brea of akron, when asked whether she had ever received a naked picture on her phone. "he was 32."even the very young are targeted. devin, a 12-year-old akron boy, said he has received images of nude women on his phone, referring to the photos as "bad things." (we are not using the last names of the youths who received such photos because we wanted them to be honest about their experiences.)there's no doubt that cell phones are a terrific way for parents to keep in touch with their families, and young people love the text-messaging option. but boys and girls who don't realize the risks often post their phone numbers on myspace, face-book or chat rooms.once they have a telephone number, sexual predators begin text-messaging kids. they say they want to be friends and begin asking sexually explicit questions.while authorities say parents need to do a little snooping on their kids' cell phones, many youngsters are adamantly opposed to that notion. others see the need for it - when necessary."i think parents should respect a kid's privacy, but some kids can't be trusted," said charles shank, 13, a seventh-grader at fairlawn, ohio's st. hilary school.consider a child's maturity and social circle when deciding whether to monitor.myspace is wildly popular with kids. it's also a hit with families who want to keep in touch with relatives across the country. but it can spell trouble for kids unable to recognize possible dangers.myspace and facebook allow computer users to create a page to be viewed online. profiles can be made public or private, meaning that only invited guests can view detailed information and photos. but because kids believe that having lots of online friends equals popularity, many don't hesitate to invite strangers to be their pals.with a few keystrokes, a predator who has been invited to view a child's page could learn details about a youngster, including the kind of music she likes, her favorite sport and when she's alone in the house."it makes her a perfect victim," brown warned.kids often post when their families are on vacation - in effect advertising when the house will be empty.administrators at facebook and myspace issue warnings that remind users their sites are public, and to be cautious about giving out personal information."people aren't always who they say they are," reads a myspace tip. "be careful about adding strangers to your friends list. it's fun to connect with new myspace friends from all over the world, but avoid meeting people in person whom you do not fully know."the myspace tips also warn users against lying about their age and posting anything that could be considered harassment or hate speech. inappropriate content, the tip declares, should be reported.some teenagers say that among their friends who have myspace pages, it's rare to find nude photos. but often the pictures are suggestive. to expose as much cleavage as possible, some girls wear low-cut clothing, hold the cameras above their heads and shoot downward.guys' pictures are generally not as revealing, though there are the occasional unzipped jeans or provocative poses.author twenge says that narcissists are attracted to online social services because they love showing off their bodies and boasting about themselves. of course, that's also got a lot to do with just being a teenager.twenge said that so much social interaction happens online that the child becomes the person they are portraying. "it shapes their identity," she said.bottom line - parents need to look at their child's myspace and facebook pages. if a youngster is shutting off the computer or quickly changing sites when an adult enters the room, that might mean she has something to hide.brown suggests that parents demand that their children share their passwords for those sites. for a teen who doesn't already have such a page but is considering creating one, a parent could help him do that.review the sites of your child's friends - and dig down a couple of layers. that's done by clicking on the pictures of his friends. if the photos are hidden, ask your youngster to do it for you.ask questions about suspicious people listed as friends, such as someone who appears to be too old to be your child's friend, or someone who's asking too many personal questions.cell safetyvisit www.wiredsafety.org for lots of cell phone and internet safety suggestions. it's possible to delete the text-messaging option from your phone service. and you can block messages from specific numbers, but you must know the number. a name is not enough.radar is a company that, for a charge, will keep track of all the text and photo messages a child receives. to do that, you must purchase a special phone through the company (www.mymobilewatchdog.com).the computer a child uses should be placed in the main part of the house.remember that chat rooms and instant messaging are where online predators lurk. there are companies that sell monitoring software for computers. spector pro (www.spectorsoft.com), for example, records snapshots of every site your child visits on the computer (including myspace and facebook) and plays them back as a slide show.consequencescell phones are a good way to keep in contact, but many teens don't realize that some of the pictures that they are sending, or receiving, might be illegal.in october, a nordonia hills, ohio, middle-schooler found out just how serious it was when he distributed a photo of a naked 15-year-old girl to his buddies.the 13-year-old boy was charged with delinquency by means of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented materials, a felony. in an agreement reached with the summit county, ohio, prosecutor's office, he pleaded to a lesser offense and will not have to register as a sex offender.it's unclear whether the picture, sent from the girl's phone, was actually taken and sent to the boy by her. if the teen had taken or sent it, she could have been charged, but she was not.police recommended counseling for both teens.cases such as these are decided on an individual basis, explained sgt. david brown with the summit county sheriff's office investigations bureau.

on raising kids: it's a time to be united





on raising kids: it's a time to be unitedon raising kids  monday, december 22, 2008 at 12:30 am q. we received our credit-card bill and called the company to dispute two $30 charges. the next day, our 9-year-old daughter admitted to taking daddy's wallet and giving the credit-card number to an online "child-centered" web site to have more access within their imaginary online play world. we're floored, to say the least, and out $60. but more importantly, our trust has been broken with our daughter.daddy is a lot tougher on her and wants to take $120 out of her bank account, take computer privileges away, and take away her digital camera for an undetermined amount of time (she paid for half of the camera and equipment and we paid the other half). i think repaying the $60 and losing the computer for six weeks is punishment enough. her camera had nothing to do with the "crime," so i don't want to take that away. your thoughts on our inability to agree on a punishment and any suggestions would be appreciated.a. your disappointment and her paying back the money are probably sufficient punishment for her serious theft. please also let her know to expect you will monitor her computer use in the future. there are computer monitoring programs available, such as eblaster (www.eblaster.com, created by spectorsoft).because you and her dad feel differently, you'll have to make some sort of compromise, or she'll think you're a pushover and won't take the situation seriously. talk about it together without her knowing about your differences, and decide on united consequences. if you both agree and show serious disappointment, it won't happen again. but if she knows you're in disagreement, you can count on a repeat performance.q. i have three children between the ages of 5 and 11. the two older boys are in the second and fifth grade, respectively, and my daughter's in kindergarten.i'm concerned about my oldest, who i believe is underachieving. both he and his brother were identified as having adhd. he did fairly well on the achievement tests a couple of years ago, but his recent test results are mediocre. his grades vacillate between wonderful and miserable. i was in the cleveland major works program years ago and underachieved myself before entering that program.i'm trying to determine if i'm expecting too much of my sons or if they are bored at school.a. a combination of doing wonderful and miserable makes it seem like your sons are capable when motivated. an evaluation by a psychologist who understands giftedness may help you determine if they are struggling or underchallenged.we don't want your sons to feel pressured, but neither should they be bored.dr. sylvia b. rimm is the director of the family achievement clinic in cleveland, ohio, a clinical professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the case western reserve university school of medicine, and the author of many books on parenting. more information on raising kids is available at www.sylviarimm.com. send questions to: sylvia b. rimm on raising kids, p.o. box 32, watertown, wi 53094 or srimmsylviarimm.com.
