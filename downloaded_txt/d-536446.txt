        an open circle for open minds 
      



























the city circle is a place where individuals are pushed to think outside the box. it provides a safe space for communities to self-critically discuss and debate issues that concern them.



















the city circle offers no doctrinal solutions but a space to explore new ideas and a place to ask questions,  to challenge and be challenged. to develop creative, confident and dynamic communities.
