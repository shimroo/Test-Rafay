				mytrees family history


















		dna testing may be used for genealogical purposes.
		it can confirm family relationships by comparing your test results with others.
		









		when deleting a previously registered search, you may leave
		any of the fields blank (except for your email address). for example,
		if you have two registered searches, one for "john jones" and one for
		"mary jones", and you specify deletion of "jones", leaving the first
		name field blank, then both the "john jones" and "mary jones" registered
		searches will be deleted. also, if you leave all the
		fields blank (except your email address), then all your registered
		searches will be deleted.
		









		looking for your ancestors? let us help! when you sign up for our "notify me" service, we'll let you know when new
		information has been added for your entered search.  we'll send you an email when new databases have been uploaded
		that contain information that satisfies one or more of your registered searches.
		








the email you enter in this page will be used to notify you about the searches you have registered.
we will not share your email with anyone else nor will we use it for any other purpose except as you
		have given us permission through other requests you may have made on our website.
