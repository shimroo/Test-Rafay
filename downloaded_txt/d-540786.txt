kentthe paradigm shift 
request info





kent was created to change the way things were done. even as a young family-owned operation, our mission was to redefine the role of a security provider. applying elite forces training, our focus has always been on prevention rather than reaction. we practice active vigilance rather than passive call-and-response. we have always been the first to invest in new technologies in order to remain a step ahead of any and all eventualities as well as maintain ourselves as industry leaders.
decades later, kent is still family owned and we have never wavered from the forward-thinking approach that made us an industry leader. today, we integrate technology and resources no other company can deliver and we’re already researching and developing the next generation of kent solutions.
additionally, in anticipation of our customers’ growing needs, we’ve expanded our footprint to include integrated security, optimized building services, exclusive hospitality programs, and streamlined business support solutions.
today’s kent is your single source provider and we’re re-engineering the way security and business services are delivered.

peace of mind 
from a security standpoint, facial recognition is unbeatable.  cards can’t be lost.  codes can’t be compromised.  human error is eliminated.  residents and tenants feel more secure because they are more secure.
×prestige 
this technology is stunning. it adds prestige to any address, wows visitors, and becomes the topic of conversation among friends and neighbors. it can even increase property values!
×upload criminal databases 
the software allows you to upload databases from local or national criminal registries to alert you of any entry attempt.
×convenience 
life is easier without keycards or codes. entry is instant and entirely hands-free. no more digging through purses or setting down packages to find keys.
×reasonable investment 
this technology is surprisingly affordable, particularly when included as part of a complete kent services package.
