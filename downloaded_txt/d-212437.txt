about us
learn more about our community









                arma was incorporated as a city of the 3rd class on may 18th 1909. this area of land had previously been known as rust (a small coal camp laid out in 1886). 
              

 the city was named for william f. armacost, one of the owners of the land that lay north and east of the camp. 
 arma is situated in the center of a rich bituminous coal deposit, which accounts for many of the earlier mines located around this area. local stories can be read at   arma kansas history  . 
 this region's mining history (including arma, pittsburg, mulberry, and 50 camp) can be explored a few minutes south of us at the miners hall museum, in the resilient community of franklin, ks.
