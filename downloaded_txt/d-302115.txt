i don't normally write a positive review without being prompted, but this one, i just had to.
				we bought two recycled herman miller chairs in 2021. after 3 years when one of the chairs developed a leak in the gas lift mechanism, we … more got in touch and david was absolutely brilliant.
				the mechanism was replaced at a very reasonable cost and when there was a minor issue with the replaced part, david sent someone to our home to resolve it immediately.
				highly impressed! this is how customer service should be everywhere!
				also, david is highly knowledgeable in everything related to workplace ergonomics!!!

our charity has used this firm for several times over the years when we need new office chairs. always outstanding service from everyone who works for them. all staff are friendly and courteous  – from the admin people who answer the phone, … more the guys in the warehouse/showroom and the delivery drivers. the guy we met in the warehouse on our most recent visit (david) was clearly an expert in his field who listened carefully to our needs, then provided appropriate advice. can't recommend them highly enough.

i ordered a motorised sit/stand desk – their sales team were very helpful through the process and the delivery man went above and beyond, helping to move the desk inside and making sure it was fully functional.
