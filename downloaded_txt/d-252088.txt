            program goals
          


          the goal of the neurology residency training program is to prepare residents for a career in academic neurology, with well-rounded strengths in clinical care, professionalism, research, and education. we are confident that every resident who we accept into our program will be able, with suitable application, to become a first-rate neurologist.
