"reality is 'of course'â¦until further notice." -- peter berger

athletic stadiums provide an excellent example of how communities can form successful private-public partnerships for acquiring new stadiums. but who should pay: teams, taxpayer, or both? if your city or region is looking to develop a major stadium, here is a generic model anyone can use, with all of the recipes and lists to follow that are needed to get started. the generic model is taken from models developed and proposed to the san francisco forty-niners and the minnesota vikings. these documents represent my valentines to the state of minnesota and viking fans world wide. 
the model presents 8 ways to finance a stadium, half private, the other half private/public partnerships, using both traditional financing mechanisms as well as new financing configurations, including a strategic game plan for securing financing. included in this model of a destination and gathering place, a business, real estate, entertainment and communications hub, are 40 ways to generate revenues in 26 revenue generating categories. there is also a 12-part compensation package for players, that is structured to make money for both players and owners in an executive relationship between them. 

needless to say, conflicts occur, and thus the need for conflict resolution models, whenever two or more people gather to attempt to persuade the other(s) to do things their way. by using these world tested models, seven at the micro or face-to-face level and seven at the macro or institution to institution level (still done by individuals), any group, large or small, can resolve their issues, solve their problems, and end their conflict. to keep all informed, the model also includes 47 models of communication. a real world example is that of the minnesota vikings quest for a partnership with the minnesota legislature. a panel has been appointed to work out if and how it can be done. 
these materials have been made available to the minnesota legislature heads, stephen swiggum, speaker of the house (r), and roger moe, senate majority leader (dfl), including, besides the generic model, a short five page summary as well as a more detailed 22 page summary, a four track process for keeping the vikings, the situation as submitted to an internet discussion group on financing stadiums, an article about the potential backlash against team owners, if not handled correctly, as well as the enclosures below dealing with conflict resolution and communications. also included is a discussion from the harvard alumni magazine on how the stadium funding problem is the unintended consequence of a 1986 federal law that attempted to encourage cities and states not to fund stadiums anymore, which had been mostly self funding from revenues received so that in the end they paid for themselves. the new law only allows 10% of revenues to go to paying for stadiums. of course people donât want to lose their teams, so when teams asked for help they got it. most stadiums have received help. as new things are learned about this, new pieces will be added.

success for corporations and other organizations can often turn on whether or not they are competitive. how can one tell? this competitive analysis model has a list/recipe of 10 components with which to compare internally as well as externally with the competition or others in the same field. such an analysis can help answer the question as to whether or not to compete, partner, or acquire?

the key to communications success is how well one follows 47 different models of communication, ranging across the board from print to broadcast to the internet, including both internal communications and external public relations, as well as how to handle the media.
the key to operational success using the internet for any organization today is to actually use the internet, from the ceo to the latest hire and back again, rather than just be entertained or emailed by it. the internet can literally save millions to billions a year. this paper reviews two articles showing how organizations can use the internet for the betterment of their customers, their employees, and any they serve. the last institutions to adapt to the internet for use in operations are governments, schools, and churches. it is not a mystery why those organizations that must show a profit to survive did so first. organizations which can tax their members for the operational dollars they need, have less incentive. 
good stewardship of taxpayer and church member donations should have made them first. political campaigns, on the other hand, the essence of raw competition, uses the internet and email probably more, proportionately, than any one else. 
contributions have been made to a number of internet sites, including those of the minneapolis story, beacon on the hill press, chargers stadium, netintrust, vikings stadium, dennis green, wamnet, heroes & dreams foundation, hyperport, and edview. in terms of education, i have written several papers on the internet revolution as it relates to education and to distant learning. i also work with web professionals to provide "web calling cards," which provide companies and individuals with an online presence that is easily changable to meet new needs for communication.

lists and recipes for success are what every person and organization needs, whether in the private or public sector. which recipes to use depends on the specific goals to be met. every organization and individual wants to achieve success. there are a number that have stood the test of time. whether for adults, kids, or corporations, they exist, and are outlined on this site. 
what is your gpa, or goals per action rating? do each of your actions serve your personal and professional goals? if yes, give yourself 4 points for each action that supports a personal or professional goal. give your self a 3 if somewhat or 2 if only a little bit, and zero for every action that doesnât fit into a personal or professional goal. combine them: that is your goal per action rating. 

corporate consulting and personal coaching takes the form of research, analysis, written and oral reports and critiques. additionally: culture commentary, ghost writing, and leading seminars and interactive workshops. 
general macarthur, when asked what was the greatest skill of a soldier, said, writing. the key to all success is to be able to understand what you read, be understood when you write or speak. every assignment, whether staff-like or in leadership positions, has always required the ability to read and write, as seen in detail under my experience, including recent work for such web sites as noted in the preceding section, communications success, as well as for such companies and organizations as beacon on the hill press, dennis green sports marketing, wam!net, heroes and dreams foundation, hyperport, edview, aqua technologies, torl, inc., as well as for congress persons.
commentary has been made on such subjects as education, a columbine p.s., the economics of racism, sales and networking, the internet revolution, public policy development/implementation/analysis, leadership training, race relations job hunting. i have also written on and given presentation on works by peter berger on social realities, mary pipher on adolescent girls and on families, stephen covey on the 7 habits of highly effective people and families, dale carnegie on positively influencing people, overcoming coming adversity via paul stoltz.
my experience includes stints as the president of three management-consulting companies in new york city and washington, dc, real estate development consultant, and, as both a guest speaker for colleges and universities and as an occasional fill-in professor. 
fees are based on an organizationâs budget, plus expenses.
