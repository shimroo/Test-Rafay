why you should pursue your personal injury claimwhen you’re injured in an accident, your financial situation can dramatically change overnight. emergency transportation costs, medical bills, property damage, and lost wages—all of these factors can severely damage your finances, and you’ll be responsible for the total financial burden unless you can recover compensation from the party responsible for the accident. no one should pay for the consequences of an accident they didn’t cause. this is a driving belief for our legal team at shamberg, johnson & bergman, and we can provide you with the representation you need to seek fair compensation from the parties responsible for your injuries. whether you were injured in a car accident, a slip-and-fall incident, or due to medical malpractice or a defective product, we are dedicated personal injury lawyers in kansas city who are committed to helping our clients achieve optimal outcomes.  you don’t have to bear the burden of an accident on your own. let shamberg, johnson & bergman take it from here, and we can guide you toward achieving the financial resources you need most right now. don’t wait to file your personal injury claimyou have a limited time to file your personal injury claim. according to missouri law, injury victims have only five years from the date of their accident to seek legal action against a negligent party.while this might sound like a lot of time, you should never wait to file your claim. as time goes on, evidence of an accident may be lost, memories of what occurred may fade, and questions about why you waited so long to seek compensation will arise.instead, contact kansas city personal injury attorneys at shamberg, johnson & bergman for help. we can explain your legal rights and options to pursue fair compensation for your injuries.

"with the help of sjb, we were able to get some answers and some peace of mind."
after our son’s birth injury, it was our ultimate goal to determine what had really happened during his delivery. with the help of shamberg, johnson, & bergman, we were able to get some answers and some peace of mind as to what had truly happened that day. in working through this process and dealing with birth injuries, there is so much personal information to divulge and so much trauma to relive, but our lawyers always handled everything with so much grace and professionalism; instead of adding to the trauma of that day, it was the beginning to the healing process for our family. even though it was a hard first step to take to make that initial contact and to share those very raw and emotional details, it is one of the best decisions we have made to reach out to shamberg, johnson, and bergman, and it has really helped us to be able to move forward. in addition to the answers that we were so desperately seeking, our lawyers also successfully helped us to get financial compensation to truly make a difference in our son’s life, and we will forever be so grateful for what they have done for our family.

have questions? we are here to help. still have questions or can't find the answer you need? give us a call at 816-542-5999 today!





how do i know if i have a personal injury case?



in order to have grounds to file a personal injury claim, you will need to prove that another person, company, government entity, or some other party is liable for your injuries and the resulting damages. this typically requires that you establish that the other party owed you a duty of reasonable care and that they breached this duty by acting negligently, recklessly, or unlawfully. you will also have to prove that the breach of the duty of care was the proximate cause of your injuries and that you sustained measurable damages.



what are damages?



in personal injury law, “damages” refers to any losses you suffer as a result of an accident, injury, or death of a loved one. damages can be both economic and non-economic. economic damages include things like medical bills, lost wages/income, lost earning capacity, future medical expenses, and more. non-economic damages, on the other hand, include intangible losses stemming from the incident, such as pain and suffering, emotional trauma, and loss of love or companionship.



how much is my case worth?



because every situation is entirely unique, it is impossible to determine the exact value of your case without conducting a thorough investigation of the facts. no reputable attorney will be able to provide an assessment of the value of your potential claim without first meeting with you to discuss the various details of your situation. contact us today for a free consultation!



how much does it cost to hire a personal injury lawyer?



most personal injury attorneys, including ours, charge fees on a contingency basis. this means that your personal injury attorney’s fees will be contingent on them winning your case. typically, personal injury firms cover the upfront costs of a case and collect reimbursement and/or attorney’s fees based on an agreed-upon percentage of the client’s total settlement or verdict if trial is necessary. to learn more about our contingency fees and how much it costs to hire a kc personal injury lawyer, please contact us today.



why should i choose shamberg, johnson & bergman chtd. for my case?



when it comes to finding the right kansas city injury attorney for your personal case, it’s important that you evaluate all potential law firm’s level of experience, reputation, and history of handling cases like yours. at shamberg, johnson & bergman, chtd., we have been representing injured individuals and the families of those wrongfully killed in kansas city and the surrounding areas since 1949. we have successfully recovered more than half a billion dollars for our clients, including some of the largest settlements and verdicts in the region. our attorneys are all highly respected and highly awarded trial lawyers in kansas city and, most importantly, all are committed to providing you with the personalized care and attention you deserve.
