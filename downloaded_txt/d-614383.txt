                 pet friendly hotels
            

wagging tails welcomed
































kimpton invites you to bring your furry friend












ok, we admit it. we have an animal attraction. can you blame us? at kimpton, we invite you to bring your furry, feathery or scaly family member — no matter their size, weight, or breed, all at no extra charge. if your pet fits through the door, we’ll welcome them in. there’s more to our pet-friendly policy than just a no-fuss check-in and scratch behind the ear, though. we’ve got all the goodies you need to keep your pet pampered. and we know a thing or two about how to travel like a pro with your pet - check out our top tips here.












here are some more ways we love your pet:

everyone deserves a little respect. your pet is welcomed by name. sometimes, our directors of pet relations might be there to greet you with a tail wag.

a selection of hotel amenities and extras including plush pet-bed loaners in your guest room, food, water bowls and mats.
a concierge list of nearby pet-friendly restaurants, parks, groomers and pet boutiques.
door hangers alert other hotel guests and staff that your cat, dog, or other beloved pet is in the room.
courtesy bags for walking your dog.
no additional charge for pets, no deposit required
no size/weight limit
no limit on number of pets allowed
nightly wine reception — pets are welcome to join the party at select hotels!
complimentary access to wag! premium during your stay. wag! connects pet parents with professional pet caregivers for pet walking, boarding or sitting (at hotels in the united states).
