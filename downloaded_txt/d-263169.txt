our historywhen haystack was founded in 1950, it was truly an experiment in education and community, with no permanent faculty or full-time students, a school that awarded no certificates or degrees. and while the school has grown in ways that could never have been imagined, the core of our work and the ideas we adhere to have stayed very much the same. history   |   architecture
