ways we servewe seek to serve christ by serving members of our community as well as members of our church. we join hands with those in nashville who minister to those in need, whether they need to be fed or housed or healed or included or given a fair chance or a measure of justice. we devote our time and talents to prayer, acts of compassion, and social justice — because we all are in need at some point in our journeys.
