lewie's tanning is the one-stop solution that brings you the highest quality tanning and skin care products. we offer a wide variety of luxurious tanning lotions from manufacturers like australian gold to ultimate. our tanning lotion supply ranges from sunless tanning lotions to bronzers that meet the needs of multiple skin types. at lewie's tanning, we are dedicated to providing unparalleled customer service by offering the products at their most competitive prices.

if you are buying tanning lotions for the first time, we understand the struggle that you might face while deciding the right product out of so many different options. but don't worry, we at lewie's tanning lotion believe in educating our customers and helping them choose the right tanning product for their skin. therefore, we have answered some of the frequently asked questions by our customers.
1. why should i use an indoor tanning lotion, and is it safe to use on my face?
indoor tanning lotions or accelerators boost tanning cells, i.e., melanin in the skin. the tanning lotions include vitamins that increase melanogenesis, which produces melanin cells and boost blood flow to accelerate the tanning process. a tanning lotion with sun protection shields skin while absorbing the uv rays to speed up the skin tan.
from your forehead to the chest, the facial area is susceptible to have allergic reactions compared to the rest of the body. therefore, it is advisable to use products that are suitable for sensitive facial skin, are anti-allergenic, and are odor-free.  
applying tanners on the face can be intimidating and a little tricky. instead of using a bunch of tanner on the face, use concentrated tanner below cheekbones and under the jawline. then apply a thin layer over the rest of the face. this gives you a subtle contoured effect. 
for starters, please take a look at our best-selling facial tanning lotion: california tan cypher titanium facial intensifier .​​​​​​​
2. what is a bronzer, and how does it work?
a tanning bronzer is a dye that helps change skin complexion instantly. one of the most commonly used bronzers is dual bronzer. dual bronzers, as the name suggests, have two complementary complexion tones, which oxidizes with the natural skin proteins and gives you a darker skin tone. for best results, wait for 4 hours after using any bronzer. 
3. why use a lotion with hemp seed oil?
hemp seed oil comprises vitamin e and c that are excellent antioxidants for the skin. vitamin e promotes cell regeneration to prevent the early onset of wrinkles, and vitamin c helps moisturize the skin. it is an excellent component in tanning lotion as tanning can dry the skin due to uv exposure.
additionally, hemp seed is also a good source of essential fatty acids and has anti-inflammatory properties. it improves the efficiency of the products with easy penetration into the skin layers. a great brand to try is hempz tanning lotions like their jwoww black bronzer by australian gold, which is a mix of instant and delayed bronzers, containing 100 percent natural hemp seed oil that keeps the skin hydrated.
4. why do some of my body areas not tan?
your waist, shoulder, and hips are some of the areas that do not tan because these are the pressure points in your body, which means your body distributes the pressure at these areas when you lie down. this pressure constricts the blood vessels to reduce the blood flow, which is why these areas don't tan. the best solution is to keep changing your positions when tanning. 
5. are there any specific products that i should use before tanning in a tanning bed?
tanning beds present an atmosphere for a perfect cosmetic tan. most people feel good and look amazing after they get a tan in bed. it is much healthier for your skin as it reduces the risk of skin cancer, acne, and any skin blemishes. the risk of burning the skin is much low in tanning beds as compared to outdoor tanning. however, you can amplify the benefits of a tanning bed by using some of our tanning accessories.
tanning eyewear: wear ergonomically shaped tanning goggles that protect your eyes from harmful uv rays, when going for a tanning bed session.
tanning stickers: keep tanning stickers handy to measure the amount of tan you receive in a tanning bed. check our cool playboy bunny stickers.
tanning hair protector: use anti-tanning hair caps to block the uv rays from harming your hair moisture and color.
tanning bed cleaner: carry a disinfectant tanning bed cleaner with you to sanitize the tanning bed before your indoor tanning session.
for more products, visit the tanning bed supplies and accessories section. look for a "tanning bed near me" to help you find the best tanning salons around you.
6. how do i protect my tattoo?
the tattoo chemicals on the skin have a sensitivity to uv rays. therefore, it is critical not to exhibit a fresh tattoo to sun rays or sunless tanning. wrap the tattoo entirely or avoid tanning until the skin has repaired. it depends on the skin type, but typically at least 2 to 4 weeks is a good enough time for healing. once healed, you can also use tattoo-friendly tanning lotions that stop the ink from disappearing. check out the brands like australian gold, devoted creations, ed hardy, and many more that provide tattoo & color fade protection while giving you visible bronzing results.
even though sunless tanning is safe, but if you have any skin allergy or sensitivity, speak to your dermatologist before going for a tan. if you have any further queries, please feel free to contact us and our customer service team will get in touch with you.
