the national association for shoplifting prevention
the national association shoplifting prevention is a non-profit organization whose mission is to raise public awareness about the harmful effects of shoplifting on youth, families and communities, unite public opinion toward constructive solutions, deliver needed programs and services and engage community action in prevention efforts to improve the lives of those affected and reduce the number of people who become involved.
practical & customizable
action plans for communities
the goal of community collaboration is to bridge the gaps between retailers, law enforcement and criminal justice by creating a streamlined and uniform response to shoplifting – a response that minimizes the expenditure of police, criminal justice, and retailer resources and maximizes the value of each apprehension in preventing recidivism and improving safety in stores and communities.
