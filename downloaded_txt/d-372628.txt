              programs            

through our investments, we dismantle the barriers that limit opportunities to create more prosperous, enriching, and sustainable communities. taken together, our investments build capacity, spark innovation, and connect stakeholders while encouraging lesson-sharing between grantees.










                      inclusive economies

                      sustainable environments                  

we support the creation of just and sustainable communities in which low-wealth and communities of color have the power to self-determine the ownership, control and stewardship of land and its infrastructure assets.

                      thriving cultures                  

we invest in artists, culture-bearers, designers, and media-makers of color who partner with their communities to radically imagine justice and foster the conditions for just systems and practices to be adopted.
