     all good things come to an end.   yes my dear friends/readers, i've decided to end this very blog !   no particular reason to be frank, i've just decided to put this site to bed.  so alas, another (fantastic/brilliant/extraordinary, you choose) blog goes away.   well, you all know i'm a (fantastic/brilliant/extraordinary/bad, you choose) musician and that it takes a lot of my time, that maybe explains the sporadic nature of posting here,  so here we go... its' a farewell !   well, don't be sad my friends, remember what the great criswell said:  ' we are all interested in the future, for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives. and remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future.' !   so, i can't really express myself on how much this lil' internet page was important to me, and how much it was fun to make/search/create !  you can't imagine how crazy it was to make those halloween/western/...
