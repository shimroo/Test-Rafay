diary and calendar software for indesign and quarkxpress
q++studio is the diary and calendar typesetting automation software, used by the world's foremost diary and calendar publishers, since 1999, to automate the typesetting of their diaries and calendars, reliably and efficiently, including the calculation and presentation of worldwide public holidays and astronomical data.
            




            q++studio uses your own indesign or quarkxpress sample layouts as input, and generates complete diaries and calendars, in the same indesign or quarkxpress file format.
            







            with q++studio, automating the most complex calendar or diary, can be done the first year in a few hours only, including all the most complex options (combination of languages, holidays, moon phases, ...).
            

			in subsequent years, updating these diaries and calendars becomes a matter of about an hour, at the most, with a proofreading budget that is reduced to almost nothing.
