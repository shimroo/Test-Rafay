what we believe




precious blood spirituality is a way of life that brings people closer to god, each other, and creation through the healing power of the blood of christ.  















how we live




rooted in the word of god and impelled by the blood of christ, we build and sustain vibrant communities and vital ministries that bring healing, hope, and reconciliation. precious blood spirituality calls for inclusion, for seeking out people who feel unloved, rejected, and alone, in the same way that christ seeks them out.  















where we are



we minister in parishes, colleges, schools, jails, and hospitals in inner city, suburban, and rural areas — wherever god calls us. we seek out places where restoration and healing are needed, in countries, neighborhoods, communities, and families torn apart by strife or violence.
