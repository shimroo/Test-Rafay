janelle @ gpljennifer is doing a great job at car people.  great “can do” attitude.  jennifer is on top of everything.  things get done super fast.  very impressed!!!
vfi was in your office recently and although i did not meet you personally i must say that you surround yourself with wonderful and caring individuals. i recently had experience for the first time with car people and words cannot express my gratitude to dave demontigny and his staff for helping (understatement!) in my search for employment in the automotive field. i informed dave of my situation and
kfunbelievable experience! paul was so awesome. he listened to my needs and requirements for finding a new job. i wanted to wait and see how things went since my new gig and two months later i am very happy. he is motivated to find you the exact job that fits your needs. i am so thankful that someone recommended talking to him. without him and car people, i’d still be searching for a new change. my old

jbi am just writing to tell you about all the time and help dave gave me in my search for a new job. he knew exactly what i was going through in my current position and promised to find me something new making me what i wanted. well, he did more than that. he found the perfect place, it's like they made a perfect position just for me! not only that, but i'm going to be making almost twice what i expected.
drjill, i wanted to take a minute and thank you for your great service. i was able to secure a great position with a very good dealership. i would have never known about the opening and they would never have known about me without you and car people. your help and guidance was fantastic. i will not hesitate to tell other qualified sales managers about you and your service. thank you! thank you! d.r.

jpi would like to inform you how wonderful it was working with dave demontigny and your company. i moved from southern california to redmond, washington a few weeks ago. i found your website online and immediately contacted dave to see if he could assist in helping me find a job. he took all of my information and kept me informed of the process. dave was very attentive, reassuring and made me feel at
jta great agency that cares about their candidates future. i have used car people three times and with each move it has provided me a better lifestyle. thank you for helping me reach my career goals! 
tki wanted to take the time to compliment dave demontigny for his recent services. i was in the position of searching for new employment and decided to fill out my profile on-line with car people. the very next day i received a call from dave, remembering me from a previous service advisor class and previous help with securing employment. dave quickly arranged a meeting and within 2 days had an interview
lvcar people has proven to be a most professional firm. they have located three wonderful positions for me in the past 15 years and the service was as great 15 years ago as today. all were done in less than one week from my call to them!! i also use them to find people for my staffing needs as well. i won’t go anywhere else. thanks for all the great service.
thanks, l.v.
lrthank you so much for everything!  i so appreciate the advice you (dave) and paul have given me through this process.  as most job changes are, this has been quite an emotional experience and i felt very comforted being able to ask dumb questions.  also, you both deserve huge hugs for your counseling services.  thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
jhhi jill. i just wanted to thank you again for all you did for us. we love idaho, and i really believe i found a home at this dealership. we have been dreaming of this since march and believe it or not idaho was our first choice. when my wife was young she drove through on a trip from canada. she told me all about it and how beautiful it was. god bless and thanx. j.h.
kdjill, i want to thank you for all the communication we shared and your efforts to help me find employment. at first i was unsure about using a service not knowing what the obligation and expectations would be; however, working with you was an absolute pleasure. i feel you understood my concerns and objections regarding the current opportunities, and i never felt pressured to say yes. although i ultimately
