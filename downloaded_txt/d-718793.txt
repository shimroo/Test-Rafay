did you know that 20% of people with bone pain report waiting more than 5 years for a diagnosis?  during this time, the pain and other symptoms can have a huge effect on mental health and wellbeing.  our pagetalert campaign has an ambitious target of £75,000 which will help us to address delays in diagnosis which can cause pain and anxiety for those living with paget's disease and potentially lead to unnecessary complications, including pain, bone deformities and fractures. read more...
