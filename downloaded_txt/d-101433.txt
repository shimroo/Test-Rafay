transcript

[speaker: georgia dixon, bachelor of business, bachelor of laws, university of technology sydney]
the law faculty has recently moved from haymarket campus to the broadway area. it's a brand new building that's very high tech and there's lots of great places to study.
 
the moot court is used for all of our mooting competitions at uts, which is like a mock trial. it's like what you see in movies, it's the fake court scenes and researching cases in the past. there's televisions all around the room, everyone can be mic'd up and we can even do video links to people in other locations. these days a lot of video links are happening between states, or even internationally, and with cameras in these rooms, we can do exactly that.
 
there are also student breakout rooms, which are the best place to go and study, you can sit around a table with a group,and have a study group all studying together, or there are individual tables where you can have some time to yourself.
 
we also have a really nice new winter garden, so you can study outside as well.
 
the trial courts are very similar to the moot court, just a smaller version with a few different setups where you can also have a witness at the front and room for other people to give expert evidence.
 
if you do a uts faculty moot you can use the preparation room. it's got special swipe card access and you can go in there and have some quiet time to prepare on a moot, practice your orals, or write your written submissions.
 
student reception is where you can go and ask any questions if you're having some issues or contact a staff member. if you have to hand in a hard copy of an assignment, student reception is where you'd go.
 
one of the best parts about being at uts central is it's the same building as the library and the reading room.
 
there's lots of wonderful facilities that are all very high tech and a great place to be continuing my studies.

acknowledgement of country
uts acknowledges the gadigal people of the eora nation, the boorooberongal people of the dharug nation,
              the bidiagal people and the gamaygal people, upon whose ancestral lands our university stands. we would
              also like to pay respect to the elders both past and present, acknowledging them as the traditional
              custodians of knowledge for these lands.
