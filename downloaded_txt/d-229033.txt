store  hoursthursday, friday, saturday 11-5 243 congress st, portland maineferdinand opened in 2001, and over the years i have discovered my love forgardening + thrifting + crafting and mixing it up between these is all i want to do.“things i make and things i like” is the motto for the shop,which is vague and could include anything. it’s my creative outlet and reflects my current obsessions.the store is only open a scandalous 3 days a week - the rest of the time i am thrifting or making something new.​a lot of merchandise in the store is made in-housefrom thrifted materials or grown in my gardenplus vintage clothing and housewares.i love to make new things & keep it fun and affordable.you can see what i'm up to via instagraminstagram.com/ferdinandferdinandinfo@ferdinandhomestore.comthanks!store hoursthursday, friday, saturday 11-5 243 congress st, portland mainein portland maine’s east end.
