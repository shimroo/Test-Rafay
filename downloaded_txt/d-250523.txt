my name is sylvia woods, and i would like to welcome you to the sylvia woods harp center.
aloha.  my name is sylvia woods. i specialize in the harp and help people of all ages fulfill their dreams of owning and playing one of these beautiful instruments. you, too, can learn to play the harp!i have been in business for over 40 years and have been instrumental in the growth of interest in the harp. a 1999 issue of the harp column magazine named me one of the "most influential harp forces of the 20th century."  and, in 2015 i received the coveted lifetime achievement award from the somerset folk harp festival for my contributions to the harp world.i am well-known for my harp music publications. my best-selling teach yourself to play the folk harp book has helped tens of thousands of people learn to play.   the 85 books and pieces of sheet music that i have arranged are available on this site in two formats: printed music and convenient pdf downloads. i also carry a wide variety of harp music by other composers and arrangers to fit every taste: classical, celtic, folk, jazz, pop, christian, christmas, jewish, and more. i offer a wonderful selection of high-quality american-made harps by dusty strings harps and the harpsicle harp company. buying a harp from the sylvia woods harp center is fun and will lead to a lifetime of musical enjoyment. email me, and i'll personally  lead you, step by step, through all the options and decisions you need to make. in 2013, i moved myself and my business to the hawaiian island of kauai. if you're going to be visiting our beautiful island, make an appointment to rent a harp, take a lesson, meet for lunch, or just say "hi."  i love getting to know my wonderful customers. you can learn more about me on the about sylvia page.thank you for allowing me to help you throughout your harp journey!sylvia woods
