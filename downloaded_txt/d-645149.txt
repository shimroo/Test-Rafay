the different innovations we see in science and technology

 the different innovations we see in science and technology  nowadays come from different bright minds working together to address  mankind's needs.as the fearless quest against hunger and diseases  continues, the complexity of human relationships goes on opposite ways,  into something paradoxical. a lot has been said and done on how people  become friends and soon go on separate ways.there are norms that  are already set in our society a long time ago. but there are also  standards set in one's self. men prefer to marry younger women. but with  some beliefs in the community, marriage of two people with significant  age gap is considered a "cradle snatchers" act for the older partner.arranged  marriage is sometimes easier to handle for more innocent women compared  to those who are already more experienced in life. the society has  already a standard as to when the marrying age is still up especially  for the females. but this doesn't mean that when they reach or have even  outgrown that preferred time, walking down the aisle is already an  elusive dream.age should not be taken as a serious factor in the  issues of marriage, just like how it is also being taken on the  corporate world. having a younger wife doesn't always mean a better  companion in life.setting people into marriage is no longer as  simple and private as before. this tradition becomes so commercialized  these days. it's like a trading game. as long as there's a willing buyer  and seller, a deal can be sealed anytime.just like a real trade,  the deal is accompanied by a contract between two individuals with a  possible involvement of a third party broker. a girl traded for marriage  is being presented with attractive opportunities like local and out of  the country travels.when all the parties agree, the contents of  the contract take place. an instant marriage is set. but the situation  is much better if the two complete strangers become good friends and  eventually, lovers.
