	enhance your space with the beauty and art of plants.


botanicus creates beautiful thriving plantscapes with expert design of foliage, flowering plants, green walls, moss walls, and artificial silk trees and bushes. our custom hydroponics horticultural system nurtures your interior garden so everyone who enters your space experiences the power of plants to clean the air and boost productivity, creativity, and well-being.






           why plants?           

               living plants and trees enhance your company’s professional image. plants add the “art of nature” to the work environment and can improve the health, morale and productivity of your staff. they are nature’s “clean air” machines, purifying the air of harmful indoor pollutants and ensuring a healthier environment (nasa study, 1988).           





           expert planning & design.           

               botanicus design experts select plants that thrive in your environment and best complement your décor. synergistic coordination with interior design professionals allows us to maximize the botanical requirements of the project. . . light, air quality, temperature and access to water are all part of creating the interior garden that best suits you. our early assistance in the planning of these environmental factors results in a more successful interior plantscape.            





           we'll handle the rest.           

               professional service by our trained, reliable horticultural technicians provides complete interior plant and customer care. uniformed, insured personnel guarantee the beauty and health of your interior plants. our botanicus team of experts – with a total of 160+ years of horticultural experience – can also rejuvenate existing interior foliage plants.           





let us design, create and maintain for you
a beautiful, healthier business!
