sustainability and art – beyond the edge

“one of the most beautiful functions of art is to envisage worlds that do not yet exist, to imagine them, give them form, help them be born and seen. beyond the edge explores a further step: combining the power of storytelling with data analysis to seek a more sustainable future for all.” –álvaro laiz
beyond the edge is a collaboration between álvaro laiz and ureculture, made possible thanks to the support of the national geographic society, the burroughs wellcome fund and the museo universidad de navarra.
