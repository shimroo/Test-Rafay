            we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to everyone who signed up early and            expressed support for the 2025 fiesta wildflower ride. your enthusiasm and            commitment for our community driven event has been deeply appreciated.
          after careful consideration we have determined that the number of early registrations            did not meet the financial obligation the event requires. as a result, we regret to            inform you that the ride will not take place in 2025.
            we recognize the disappointment this may cause and assure you that we feel it too.            we are committed to reevaluating event viability for 2026, with more time for            promotion and planning we remain hopeful.
            for those who have already signed up, we will be issuing a full and easy refund for            your registration. you will receive more details on the refund process shortly, and            we will ensure that everything is handled promptly and smoothly.
            thank you once again for your understanding, and we hope to have your support in            the future as we work towards making this event a reality.
             
sincerely,
