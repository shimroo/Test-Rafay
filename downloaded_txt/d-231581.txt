on new eyes
how i’ve learned to take flying for granted; how it’s remarkable, really. reminded of this by two small kids sitting in front of me for an auckland to wellington commuter flight this morning. it was their first time in a plane, and they were so excited about every minute of it, from “3, 2, 1, blastoff! we’re flying!” to “yaaaaay! teddy, we did it!”and in the middle, “look at that pointy mountain! ice! like elsa!”
