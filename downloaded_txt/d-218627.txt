what’s wrong with american christianity?







are you a person of your word?














the trumpet has a long history of accurate forecasting.
our model can be traced back to 1934, and the creation
of the plain truth magazine by herbert w. armstrong.
between 1934 and 1986, mr. armstrong explained world news
and delivered multiple prophecies, many of which have been
or are currently being fulfilled. the trumpet today carries
the mantle of mr. armstrong and the plain truth.
