in a 17th century old mansion ( but with a lift and clim in all rooms !!) situated in a very quiet street, hotel du lys with 23 rooms is one of the best offers in paris for its location, services and reasonable prices. 

it is located in latin quarter, in a stone�s throw from the seine river, and in walking distance of notre-dame, the louvre, the sorbonne, the luxembourg 's garden, 
saint germain des pr�s, beaubourg, saint louis island, invalides, sainte chapelle and the musee d�orsay. this hotel, is very near rer and metro saint michel station.

 hotel du lys has been talked about by many french and foreign publications.
the weekly  magazine � elle� wrote :

hotel du lys 
high ceilings with visible oak beams, 
frameworks, black and white stone floors give charm to a 17th century- old- building. most of the rooms 
are well decorated with floral tapestries and wallpaper.


hotel du lys �s history


this mansion  in an old dwelling built at the beginning  of the 17th century in one of the most 
ancient street of old paris, in those days the actual bld st germain formed the limit of the city.
la rue serpente formerly vieus serpentis dates from 1180, st derived its name from a sing representing 
a serpent and not because it twisted or wound the trace of this serpent can be found to day at nearby 
 5 rue, hautefeuille in a beautiful renaissance maison with turret. the in the caretaler�s loge can be seen a wooden
 sculptured  mermaid a serpent it represents fairy melusine or the women serpent which was the godesse guardian angel 
of the provinz of poitou it gaves its name to the nearby rue des poitevins . in the middle age the rue serpente was only 
a small path crossing vineyards clos de laas belonging to the abbey of saint germain des pr�s.at the later date noble
 dwelling were built mansion of henneval, the mansion of tillet de montarme. 
this house is actually situated on that spot. until the french revolution in 1789 lived there the marquese de berosse 
then le marquis de la mothe st heraye le comte de breuil le marquis de billemort, le marquis de bleumartin and lastly 
the comte de l�arvoisin .camp marshall of the armies of ring louis xvi. in 1908 the mansion was transformed for its present 
use under the name hotel du lys so to perpetuate by the loyalty of the old owners to the emblem of the crown of france.
we have tried to make this old house as attractive and confortable as possible in spite of the little inconveniences
 which we must accept as a tribute to the past.
