not all pet insurance is created equal
not all pet insurance is the same and can impact the veterinary care you can afford for your pet. we’ve teamed up with professor noel fitzpatrick to help you ask the right questions when finding a pet insurance policy that suits you:

will i pay more for claiming?
do your pet insurance policies cover dental illness and injury?
are there any additional vet fee limits on this policy?

                                        is pet insurance worth it?
                                    

did you know that more than half of pet owners have had to make an unexpected trip to the vet? you might think that if your pet isn’t the active type you don’t need insurance – but getting ill is actually much more common than getting injured.
                                            insuring your pet allows you to focus on getting your pet back to good health – not on worrying about the vet bills you might need to pay out for.

                                        what does pet insurance cover?
                                    

not all pet insurance is the same, and what’s covered will vary depending on what policy you choose. petplan policies are designed to cover as many illnesses and injuries as possible, as well as some things other policies don’t cover, like behavioural issues, diagnostic tests and dental, as long as you take your pet for annual veterinary dental checks . when purchasing pet insurance, it’s really important to do thorough research to understand exactly what’s covered so you won’t get caught out if you need to claim.

every pet is individual and unique so we have a range of plans to suit every cat, dog and rabbit, from time-limited to lifetime policies – we even have a multi-pet discount if you have more than one furry friend. we’ve compiled a handy guide explaining the different types of policies in the market and to help you decide which best meets your needs.

“best pet insurer inthe business by far!”






                        we’ve had our miniature pinscher with them since we rescued her 6 years ago. we’ve only claimed twice in all that time but large amounts (£3,000 and the latest over £5,000) and both times they’ve paid within days, no additional questions but more importantly our premium has less than doubled over that time. amazing service from the best pet insurer in the business.
                        ron baker, june 2024





“reliable and dependablewhen you need them”






                        our dogs over the years have all been on petplan. they have always been dependable and reliable, so when our lovely old rescue dog got a tumour, we felt reassured that her treatment would be covered, one less worry. her bill was paid within a few days, and she is recovering well.
