about us 


family owned


custom made


2d & 3d software


available anywhere


we'll deliver


life tyme boats, inc. has been a family-owned boat building business since 1985.  all of our boats are custom made to client specifications or government contract.  these are strong, heavy aluminum
        boats with durability and safety in mind.
even boat building is subject to new technology, so we keep a constant eye on upgrades and new methods.  for instance, at one time life tyme boat design was done at the old-fashioned "drawing board."
        nowadays, new designs are produced using 2-d and 3-d cad software.
although we're located in louisiana, we have customers as far away as alaska, the florida keys, the bahamas, and the virgin islands.  and we deliver!
