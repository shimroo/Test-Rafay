welcome to the
ocean city yacht club

our mission, established many years ago, still stands today:
encouraging and promoting amateur yachting on the great egg harbor bay and its tributaries.
the ocean city yacht club, established in 1901, is rich in both history and tradition. we have one of the most active and competitive sailing programs in the mid-atlantic region including bay and offshore racing. 
the 2024 season marks the 123rd year that the ocean city yacht club (ocyc) has been in existence, an organization steeped in family values and tradition.
the club has a multitude of activities for members to enjoy sunset meals on the bay, saturday night theme parties, bridge, golf, fishing, and sailing/boating events.  there are innumerable events to socialize with friends and meet new people.
members can also look forward to the continuation of philanthropic endeavors the club has supported over the past years, such as fishing for kids in june and the ocyc foundation.  these events demonstrate the club’s commitment to worthwhile causes benefitting the community. 

our listed upcoming events are member only invited registered guests are welcome
