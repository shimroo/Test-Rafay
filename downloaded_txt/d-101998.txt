bangkok water taxi 

it’s nice to know that the inner city canal system is still in use, even after most of them were filled in from the 1960s. if you get the chance, it’s a little bit off the beaten path and it’s a cheap way to both get around and see some funkier areas of bangkok: khlong saen saep boat service

triton is no longer the bang saen special 

we wanted to transfer my lowrider to nam’s name from her sister’s, in order to prepare it for possible sale. the prefectural inspection officer we ran into at the land transport office either wanted a bribe and didn’t ask for it clearly enough, or was just having a bad day, and decided to insist that my truck was too low and had to be restored to standard height (which is technically not a law here). either way, we were not in the mood to pay into corruption and thought it might be easier to sell the truck at standard height anyway, so we took it for modification to nam’s old classmate across the street, who runs a garage in front of his house. pics of the restored-to-stock truck will follow after i’ve replaced the tires to match the ride height. the photos below are just a remembrance of why i bought it in the first place (in honor of the lowered racing trucks aka rod sing cruising the beach roads in chonburi province).
gauge cluster (mostly wrong/defunct – true racer style)
a shift indicator – the first one i’ve used since learning to drive stick in a porsche 944 35 years ago!

rear drums, baby!
pickle loves hanging out under the truck and in its shadows all day – it’s very secure
the shop pictured is the one written about above, but the photos are from a previous visit, when they were replacing brake pads and doing maintenance.

21 years of steam 





if that’s not a cringey steam profile, i don’t know what is. i’d like to say i registered for steam on dial-up, but looking back on posts from 2003 just before i signed up*, it was either my first ftth line (ntt 100mbps service on a japanese island 20 years ago!), or dual isdn (128 kbit/s and more expensive than the ftth, if i remember correctly).
i was one of the only dual isdn subscribers on awaji island according to the techs who installed it. after i upgraded to ftth and they came by for maintenance, they said i had the fastest hikari (fiber) connection they had seen, as well. i can’t remember all the tweaks we were using, but there were software configs as well as hardware hacks and accessories. ironically, in those infant days of broadband speed tests, some cable internet company in yokohama often had the highest scores on the leaderboards!
it was interesting over time to see where broadband expansion flourished. korea was the leader for a long time. back home in the states, it was sad to see how slow both the rollout and speed of ftth was, and how corporate monopolies and weak legislation resulted in terrible service for almost everyone. over here in thailand, things took off five or so years after i got here. my very first ftth provider here was a neighborhood kid who hacked together his own dslam in his house (his main cost was keeping the equipment from overheating, he would leave the aircon on all day) and strung lines for subscribers all over the gated community. back then, almost nobody had a computer (net cafes were in their heyday), but damn, that kid had a sharp business mind (and a miserably hot st. bernard named tang mo). i still see that kid around sometimes; i’m pretty sure he’s running several businesses around town.
*steam apparently launched on september 12, 2003. i registered within the first month, and a few million users had registered by the end of the first year, according to reddit. the reason i got on steam in the first place? to make playing counter-strike easier! i never would have thought it would still be so popular (and basically unchanged).

noro-san in thailand 

my pal t brought his 80 year old uncle to thailand for an end of the year trip and we hung out for a week. it was his first trip on an airplane for 30 years, and everyone had a great time with him. i’ve been putting together a series of shorts with the highlights.

hope to shovel more of these guys in my tummy later this week. some friends are coming from japan, so we are doing an end of year trip to see them in pattaya, bang saen, and bangkok. ironically, it’s hard to find good seafood near the sea in popular places here, so we have to scope out good places online before we go. over the past decade, google maps has become the best in gauging places from their reviews, and more importantly, the kind of people posting them.
