forest inn masonry supply was established in 1978 by richard and barbara getz. richard and his cousin luther hittner had started a contracting business and saw the need to open a masonry yard that supplied block and cement in this area. while barbara ran the office and helped the customers in the yard, richard did any deliveries that came about or helped his crew.
