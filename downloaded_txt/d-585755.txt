your story becomes powerful once it appeals to the imagination.

we communicate a lot, but not with the intended effect. often the sender needs a lot of words to organize his thoughts, while the receiver does not understand exactly what point is being made. language is rich, but also enormously concealing. with all the business lingo we use, words can turn into completely different images in peopleâs minds. as a result, it takes a long time to reach agreement.
let’s be honest, we all know them: meetings that seem to last forever, boring presentations that consist of chunks of text, long discussions because you just don’t fully understand each other, notes and reports where you have to read every sentence at least twice before you understand what it says.
we know that it can be done differently:




a meeting in which you all have the same image in mind






a presentation that immediately appeals to the imagination






making clear during a conversation where the crux is



say more in less words: that’s what we do! with the power of visual communication.
house of imagination is your #1 partner for effective, inspiring communication. we make visible what you really mean.

our services









customized info drawing

policy, strategy, plans. they often end up unread in a mailbox. how about the essence on 1 sheet of paper? one drawing says it all. weâll make you a visual summary, so that your colleagues will understand you at once. a customized info drawing is an attractive visual story that fits on one sheet of paper. it summarizes your key messages in drawings and bullet points, in a well-arranged way. you can use the info drawing to hold a lively presentation or to support a conversation about the topic. by involving your audience through images, the story comes to live. your message is no longer abstract, but concrete. in addition, your audience will link the content to the images. did you know that our brains love images? we remember visual information much easier than text.

live visual recording

what do you actually remember from a meeting? research shows: almost nothing. but: with a visual summary itâs much easier to remember what was said. during your meeting or event we will draw a live summary. whether you have a small board meeting, or a big seminar. a conversation, or presentation. a panel discussion, brainstorm or designsprint. live or online. while the session unfolds, we capture the essence.
we listen critically, summarize and bring the essence of the session to life with images. we are well able to filter the important information. at the end of the meeting you will have a visible, tangible result. you can fly us in, for a summary on a meters long piece of paper, or we join you digitally and create our summary live on the ipad.

visual facilitation

are you making new plans, or do you want to draw out the vision, mission or strategy for the upcoming year(s)? it helps to have a common vision. literally. in a visual strategy session we guide you in the process of translating ideas into a compelling visual story. we design a program, visual templates and record the outcomes. in drawings of course. thatâs visual facilitation!
we offer visual facilitation for short sessions, or complete 3-day design sprints, live or virtual. we are experts in designing and hosting creative, interactive virtual sessions.

business drawing for beginners

we all have them: those meetings that seem to last forever, boring presentations that consist of chunks of text, discussions between colleagues that don’t go well because you just don’t fully understand each other. it is not clear what it is about because language evokes different images in people, it is not possible to reach agreement and agreements, the energy leaks away and afterwards you are left frustrated and uninspired.
our business drawing courses are known for it: they are fun, practical and accessible to everyone. we teach you and your colleagues how to translate a business message in compelling and clear drawings. you learn to make drawings that suit your target group, the goal and the specific work content of your organization. we offer basic workshops and extensive training.













with business drawings you improve communication:




you have the same image in mind






you create a quick overview and understanding of complex themes






you make new policy clear âat a glanceâ






you give presentations that appeal to the imagination



we are based in the netherlands, but host our workshops around the globe through videoconferencing.

our customers say it much better!






house of imagination is a great partner to work with. they think along with their customer and work flexibly and creatively.
jorien rã¶ling, municipality of amsterdam





always a pleasure to work with house of imagination! good draftsmen who visualize complex processes and meetings very clearly for us on paper. the energy transition table, with five different sessions, is a good example of this.
evelien ten cate, municipality of gouda.





another valuable collaboration between house of imagination and the royal auris group! good communication and quick collaboration. the power of imagining and visualizing is immediately apparent with live drawings. while talking and thinking about the images you automatically become focussed on the core of your story. we are inspired to use business drawings more in our collaboration. nice proceeds that will once again be given a central place at the location in the coming year as inspiration and incentive when working on our common goals.
lonneke de kraker, koninklijke auris group





annemarie of house of imagination has visualized our annual priorities at indigo. very happy with it. nice contact. fast results. and very nice, fitting drawings. without effort or sigh she adjusts the drawings (once again) as desired; wishes that sometimes change with a large management team. we now have a super nice infodrawing that we can use all year round. thank you!
marlouke zimmermann, indigo

international partner of edding en legamaster

we like a practical approach. we want to make business drawing possible for everyone, in any work environment, with resources that are accessible everywhere. you don’t need anything special to get started with business drawing. you will find a flipchart or whiteboard in every office. and there is a marker in every drawer. no doubt there’s even an edding marker in your kitchen drawer! you don’t need more than that to communicate in a visual way. you just need to learn how to cleverly combine text and images.
to keep it simple and approachable, we use materials that are familiar in every office. a flipchart or whiteboard from legamaster and the trusted markers from edding. together we put âthe power of visual communicationâ on the map in more than 10 countries. this improves the quality of collaboration and communication worldwide!
