an arthur hills gem

our arthur hills designed 6,936-yard golf course opened in 1997 and features four sets of tees to ensure a challenging yet fun test of golf. scottish links-style golf courses inspired the front nine layout, which sits on 200 acres of land and features six lakes. the holes are named accordingly: troon, st. andrews and turnberry, just to name a few. it's a different story on the back nine, as the layout weaves through several densely wooded areas, influenced by famous holes much closer to home, such as those found at augusta, winged foot and shinnecock hills. legendary run is part of the audubon sanctuary program, which enforces strict respect of the natural habitat through the design process and ongoing course maintenance program. we welcome you to experience a facility that offers country-club-caliber golf conditions, with what our management team calls "the friendliest service in the world".
