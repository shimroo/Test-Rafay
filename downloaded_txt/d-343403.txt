  tru group clients in lithium and brine range from junior or high-tech, to multi-billion- dollar conglomerates, for example, adnoc, advanced metallurgical group lsm, materials & electrochemical research corp, eog resources, om group inc, mitsubishi corporation, exxonmobil, resource capital funds usa, sojitz corp, rio tinto, posco, lithium americas, rodinia lithium, chemtura-lanxess, petroleum oman, molymet, as-census specialties and several other  brine and mineral operating companies. 
tru group inc  has a full comprehensive capability to engineer the production of battery grade lithium chemicals from brines or minerals! tru group is is a focused on the most advanced production technology in 2022 for for example engaged in multi-million dollar assignments in produced-water extraction, dle direct lithium extraction, and state-of the art lithium metal / lithium alloy engineering.   we are world leaders in resource evaluation, salt lake salar exploitation, brine & mineral ore (spodumene, pegmatites etc) leading-edge lithium extraction, processing, purification refining and recycling technologies - those in use, prospective, and leading edge - solar evaporation, selective ion adsorption, solvent extraction, electrodialysis, dle direct lithium extraction, nanofiltration & advanced membrane, sileach /u-max, spodumene conversion, mica etc. importantly our team includes strong potash, boron / borates, iodine, bromine, magnesium and fertilizer capability usually lithium production coproducts.
tru group lithium & brine team is expert in all aspects and lithium technology:  indeed, in 2020 there has been increasing demands from our clients for due diligence evaluations of lithium technology supplies - especially when claims of a breakthrough is made. our lithium expertise covers production and refining of lithium resources such as evaporation ponds, brines, spodumene mining: lithium basic chemicals - lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride: lithium intermediates - organo-lithium, butyl-lithium, lithium metal, lithium alloys and compounds - lithium cobaltate (licoo2 - positive electrode-active material for a lithium secondary cell). we have simulated, mapped, described and analyzed process details of many producer facilities. tru group  has conducted numerous lithium lithium feasibility studies and lithium investor due diligence assignments. importantly in the lithium and battery materials space - where there have been few successes of over 100 new project attempts since 2009 when tru group made groundbreaking presentations at the first global lithium conference in san diego argentina- now, in 2022, tru group is following more than 150 lithium brine projects in the "lithium triangle" alone. tru group standards are high  and we are  the most high-profile globally in warning of the  now proven dramatic consequences of the lack of technical competence in the comparatively novel highly-specialized lithium space (like dle direct lithium extraction). tru group has all the cross-functional expertise required. this being so tru group participates in lithium projects tru group assesses as totally legitimate and that have reasonable prospects.
tru group lithium & brine team members 2022, with over 150 person-years of experience at all the lithium big-3 brine majors - sqm, fmc, chemetall and china facilities - have managed, evaluated, designed, engineered, pilot-tested, specified equipment, developed and built these existing lithium plant facilities. indeed the team includes  individuals   who worked on the first geological & chemical lithium investigations in the 1970's for salar de atacama, chile and silver peak, usa! our team members know, have visited and have assessed most of the lithium facilities or salars in the lithium triangle chile,  argentina & bolivia, plus china nevada usa,  australia, canada, russia and zimbabwe etc. indeed, ihor kunasz (pictured left at salar uyuni) conducted the original exploration and brine resource determination of the salar de atacama.  tru group undertook the most comprehensive, salt-flat through all downstream facilities,  operational and financial global analysis of the lithium big-3: sqm, fmc and rockwood-chemetall (acquired 2014 by  albemarle corporation).  tru group has been  engaged concurrently in several salar brine, mineral based spodumene and sulfate of potash (sop) / oilfield produced water / geothermal / bromine brine feasibility / amenability lithium chemicals conversion studies. 
tru group inc uses the most advanced chemistry simulation modeling to evaluate lithium brine process engineering. for example, tru group  2022 in a current assignment is using  simulations to evaluate dle direct lithium extraction process claims (dle selective adsorption, dle  ion exchange, dle solvent extraction, dle electrolytic and dle electro-dialysis ed). this work is part of a deep dive investigation of more than twenty enterprises globally claiming to possess or are currently developing direct lithium extraction technology (especially for low lithium concentration brines). tru group has modeled brine-bittern-carbonate-process options to rank over 170 global lithium brine salt lakes / flats / salars (plus geothermal, oilfield brine sources) for their amenability to the use of emerging lithium extraction technology (electrodialysis •  selective absorption • ion exchange •	posco • eramet • tenova-bateman •	simbol materials-alger - tesla battery  driven etc). we have also evaluated and ranked major global lithium mineral ore sources comparing mineral-based to brine-based resources. tru group have undertaken many technical, engineering, modeling, industry, economic, financial, cost, marketing, supply-demand, feasibility and due diligence assignments in lithium. tru group lithium & brine team includes lithium application specialists for example in batteries [plus battery design], fuel cells, electric vehicles, glass, lithium chemicals [such as lithium lubricants / greases and pharmaceuticals] lithium alloys and other battery material.
tru group lithium & brine team member visits included the salt lake facilities and other key lithium brine properties, for example the following -


albemarle corporation: rockwood  (formerly chemetall foote), usa - silver peak, nv, usa*
albemarle: chemetall-scl: sociedad chilena del litio la negra, chile - salar de atacama, chile*
livent: fmc corporation, usa â minera del altiplano, argentina - salar del hombre muerto, argentina**

lithium americas (minera exar) / orocobre - salars cauchari-olaroz, argentina
bolivian government, bolivia - salar de uyuni, bolivia         


        * the rockwood properties were acquired  and will operate as   "albemarle corporation"  commencing 2015 ** formerly fmc lithium

tru group has  diverse brine technology capability.  our brine projects and expertise encompass salars, salt-flats, salt-lakes, evaporated lakes,   geothermal-brine, produced-water brines (from oil & gas drilling / fracking), sea water, semi-processed waste brines, desalination plant waste brines, coal seam gas water, mining brines, any wastewater and groundwater aquifer brines or evaporated salt in various forms. tru group in 2018 was continuing its assessment of the amenability of various processes for lithium & zinc extraction from salton sea geothermal operations, usa. we are also still working 2022 on  a number of similar assignments (including a detailed feasibility study in the us oil patch) for the largest american and global oil & gas companies  with respect to oilfield produced-water brine for the extraction of  bromine â¢ iodine â¢ lithium â¢ potash â¢ magnesium â¢ strontium â¢ zinc as well as chlor alkali products. earlier, tru group examined the smackover brinies in in the usa for chemtura-lanxess bromine / bromide, lithium and other chemicals, and in 2022 again for a major oil company using dle direct lithium extraction.
tru group has in depth state-of-the art engineering capability in extracting valuable brine-based chemicals such as lithium, magnesium, potassium, bromine, iodine, boron, strontium and others. indeed, our continuing 2021-2023 assignments include cleaning the final water discharge for portable, agricultural or demineralized-water use!. . our tru group lithium & brine team members have visited and have studied all of the major and most of the undeveloped brine resources - south america, china, tibet, and usa (smackover ar & salton sea ca). examples,salar de atacama, maricunga, cauchari, incahuasi, olaroz, puna region, clayton valley nv, smackover arkansas bromide brines, sabkha matti / dead sea middle east and many others around the world.
tru group inc has the strongest capability to evaluate brine asset investments and undertake due diligence at all levels of  brine processing.  many brine-based facilities are only economic as  multi-commodity operations and include lithium, potash, bromine, iodine, fertilizers, boron, boric acid, chlor alkalies, strontium carbonate, magnesium, salt and other salt products - for which tru group have a solid capability. also see -
 
tru group has engineered an integrated elemental metallic lithium facility that is proceding to piloting. then tru group late 2023 has begun another challenging prefeasibility study of a large metallic lithium plant. (the facility will be integrated with metallic sodium using  electrolytic downs cells and take advantage of the attendant byproduct chlorine installation).
 tru group in 2023 is following over 150 brine projects in the "lithium triangle" and has used a unique evaluation criteria to evaluate and rank them. tru group can provide the updated ranking for any lithium project based on the very latest developments.  see: tru group investing in lithium companies. virtually all chinese brine-based lithium operations grossly underperformed. even the most modern ore-based chinese jiangsu plant built by western engineers seriously underperformed (explosion and sold at a loss). production of lithium chemicals to the crucial strict specifications is very challenging! lithium technology is tricky, high tech and highly specialized. see +  +
