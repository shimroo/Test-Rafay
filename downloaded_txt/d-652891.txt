"our rural dry hydrant network has 
      decreased our response time and allows us to maintain the fire 
      underwriters superior tanker shuttle, equivalent to hydrant rating 
      classification with the shuttling of fewer tankers. this results in a 
      savings of fuel and wear and tear on department vehicles. it means we 
      spend less time auguring ice and setting up portable pumps and more time 
      fighting fires."
