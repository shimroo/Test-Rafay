welcome to how music really works: the essential handbook for
                            songwriters, performers, and music students (second edition)
welcome to the first 6 free chapters of the acclaimed music reference classic,
                        how music really works: the essential handbook for songwriters, performers, and
                                music students (second edition), by wayne chase. (the book is
                        available in both digital and print editions
                        at roedy black music.)
                    
how music really works focuses on popular music, especially popular songs and
                        songwriting,
                        and especially the styles and forms of the western world. this book is aimed at those who play
                        in bands, write songs, take lessons,
                        or teach music. since most such players and songwriters donât read or write music notation, this
                        book has none. but it
                        does have a lot of graphics and sidebars that illustrate and clarify the content.
this book addresses the all-important question for songwriters, âwhat exactly is it about the
                        melody, chord progression, beat,
                        and lyrics of a song that makes it irresistibleâor, on the other hand...completely forgettable?â
                    
if youâre curious about where music itself came from, the first couple of chapters delve into
                        musicâs evolutionary origins, followed by a brief historical overview of the popular music
                        industry and the various musical genres we know today. after that, it gets into the details of
                        what a popular song is actually made of.
