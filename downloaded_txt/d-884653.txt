welcome to folk directions,  a program of traditional and contemporary music arising from many kinds of folk-oriented traditions;   musicâunbounded by time or space that includes, but is not limited to, ballads, piedmont country blues, bluegrass, old-time,    celtic,   cajun, and more. no holiday music is  aired.
airing thursday mornings from 9:00â11:00 (eastern) on ckut 90.3 fm radio in montreal, the mountain city, folk directions  reaches parts of northern new york state, northern vermont, and eastern ontario. it is also streamed live and archived on the world wide web.
for those wishing to submit music for airplay consideration,        i now pre-record folk directions two weeks ahead of timeârarely getting to the station. 
          if you plan on sending music there for me, 
          please also email  a preview/download link by clicking here. as well, in order to be promoted, notices of 
upcoming gigs should be sent  at least two weeks in advance. 

folk directions is a sing out! radio partner.
