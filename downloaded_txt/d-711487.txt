neena govindhan
fourth year software engineering undergraduate



to me becoming an engineer means that i get to solve puzzles. in a big or small way, solving those puzzles could directly impact the world around me.
i have always loved logical thinking and solving problems and i saw that by pursuing engineering, i could make a career out of that. software engineering felt like a natural fit for me because i had thoroughly enjoyed my computer science courses in high school.
when we study engineering, we develop actionable skills that can make an impact in the world. as engineers, we learn to create, improve on and optimize solutions to create a better experience for everyone.
