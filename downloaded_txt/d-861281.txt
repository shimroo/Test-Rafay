gwic gazette




our latest edition
2024 summer




gwic’s seasonal magazine, the gazette focuses on refreshing contents about traditions and culture of club members from all over the world, showing the diversity of our expat community. meanwhile, with regard to all the social and cultural events and opportunities happening in guangzhou, gazette wishes to give voice to the local communities and partners, which we work closely together with, in the creation of socially meaningful events to raise awareness and funds for local charitable causes. every issue contains knowledge sharing articles from volunteer writers about traditions, celebrations, or travel tips, reviews of gwic signature events, charity fairs, a list of concession partners and an overview of clubs and activities gwic offers for their members.

gwic cookbook









 











 











 











 












the gwic cookbook is unique because it consists of stunning contributions from international ladies connected because of covid time in guangzhou (china).
we desire to create dishes that make us feel at home away from home, share childhood favorites, make secret family recipes, and tell others about cultures, food traditions, and fascinating life stories.
