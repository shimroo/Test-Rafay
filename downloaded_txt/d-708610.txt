explanation for my absence 







greetings, i have not posted here in a very long time, for which i apologize. soon after i made my last posting, my mother unexpectedly passed away, which was a shock and a terrible hardship for my family and myself.

during that time, i was overburdened with moving to a new home, while trying to fix up both the new house and repairing the old house, which had fallen into disrepair. i simply hadn't had the heart to blog, as it was such a sad and difficult time, and i lost my almost daily habit of writing and photographing.

many people have asked me to take this up again, and i thank everyone who has giving me support, encouragement, and prayers.

archbishop carlson on the current situation





from the article archbishop carlson calls for peace as grand jury says no indictment for ferguson police officer:“i implore each of you: choose peace!” said archbishop carlson, who prayed at the memorial site for brown in the days after the shooting and led a rosary on nov. 5 in january-wabash park. “reject any false and empty hope that violence will solve problems. violence only creates more violence. let’s work for a better, stronger, more holy community— one founded upon respect for each other, respect for life, and our shared responsibility for the common good.”

celebrating st. louis

 dear faithful and friends of st. francis de sales oratory,

 
saint francis de sales church   c.1900

kirchweihfest - sunday, november 23, 2014, after 10 am mass
"kirchweihfest" is a german word that means "church dedication feast," a celebration that highlights the importance of reserving a church building for sacred actions and sacred things, for the glory of god and the sanctification of man. the german roots at st. francis de sales are deep, reaching back to the german immigrants of st. louis, who built this church in 1867, and rebuilt it after a tornado destroyed the first in 1896. the present church building was dedicated on november 26, 1908.

seminary society breakfast
in addition to marking this milestone, this year's kirchweihfest will be an occasion for us to show our support for the seminarians, the future priests who will serve the church and oversee many more “kirchweihfests” in the coming years. please join us, and the seminary society which organized this year’s event, for this double celebration!

waterloo german band
the festival will include: christkindl market, rector's raffle, chocolate cake contest, entertainment provided by the waterloo german band, and much more!

menu: sauerbraten, bratwurst, chicken tenders (for children), sauerkraut, braised cabbage with apples, mashed potatoes with gravy, german potato salad, rolls, chocolate cake, coffee and tea. (catered by two mike’s catering.)

gaudete gala 2014 – tickets for purchase now!

the sheldon concert hall
advent will be here soon. as the new liturgical year unfolds before us, what a great blessing it will be to be immersed in the unfathomable spiritual riches of holy mother church! in the midst of advent is gaudete sunday, whose theme, “rejoice!”, will fill our hearts with joy as we anticipate the coming of our blessed savior.

more than a fundraiser, the oratory’s gaudete gala, now in its fourth year, is a unique and festive musical expression of the joy of advent, and the gratitude for the blessings of the sacred liturgy. the gala will give the oratory faithful and clergy an opportunity to share the church’s rich sacred music tradition – something we experience every sunday - with one another, with our friends and family, and with our city community at large. featuring the choirs of the oratory under the direction of mr. botkins, the gala will also highlight the wonderful talents developed through the oratory’s sacred music program in the past nine years. all proceeds from the gala will be used to support the sacred music program.

stained glass window repair update

artisans carefully working summer 2014lauds. the first light of the day has penetrated the stained glass windows of the oratory, bringing the saints and angels into the sanctuary in an array of colors: reds, blues and greens. by compline, the ever-present images in windows recede into the shadows amidst the prayers of the oratory community, waiting again for lauds and the first light of morning.

as illuminated decorations of churches since the middle ages, stained glass windows have been a part of the rhythmic daily life of the church. st. francis de sales oratory has been blessed with many well-crafted windows that beautify the interior of the church, highlighting various saints throughout the day with the movement of light and time. they are part of the distinctive attributes that make this church the “cathedral of south saint louis.”
     
stained glass windows are known to withstand the test of time, but never without periodic repair and restoration. our windows are close to 100 years old; weathering and the ravage of time have made repairs an unavoidable task for us.

within the last five years, several windows were so badly damaged by storms that decisive actions had to be taken to preserve them. in december 2009, a window in the choir loft had to be removed and stored until suitable repairs can be made.
     
then last winter, the beautiful window in the sanctuary, featuring sts. jerome and gregory, was so damaged by the storm that it had to be repaired immediately. working with the emil frei and associates, the original crafters of our windows in the last century, it took several months of work to complete the repairs, but the process has gained us many insights into the methodology we will need to restore all our historic windows in the future.

typical of windows of this age, the level of restoration depended on the condition of the glass and support structure, and, unavoidably, budgetary constraints. the frei experts found the outer protective glass and the glazing had deteriorated badly from normal wear and tear, and the supporting terra cotta mullions were cracked and failing, thus unable to completely support the glass. instead of rebuilding the terra cotta support for this glass, a larger, thicker protective glass was installed farther out from the stained glass and a new support constructed, thereby retaining the architectural quality without overloading the terra cotta mullions. both the inside stained glass and the outside protective glass were cleaned and re-glazed.
     
this repair also has a large thermal benefit since a recent study of the heating and cooling needs of the church building has shown that the windows, by far, are the worst contributor to heat loss in winter and would be detrimental to any attempt to air condition in the summer. by moving the protective glass farther away and using thicker glass material, there will be a significant improvement to the obvious thermal inadequacies of the building.

in addition to structural integrity that is leak-proof, the restoration has made a big difference in the appearance of the window from inside the sanctuary: clearer, brighter, and more vibrant. the brighter jerome-gregory window can now serve as a model for the repairs that we will need to do on all of our iconic windows. we will work with frei to determine the next window that is in most need of repair.update on the last matching gift of $4,300.00: there is still an opportunity to help with this generous initiative. we still need $3,940.25 to match this donation. the deadline has been extended to december 8, the feast of the immaculate conception. 

celebrating st. louis


saint louis ix, king of france
 on october 19, 2014, his grace, archbishop robert j. carlson, came to visit with the institute’s community and faithful at st. francis de sales oratory to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the birth of king st. louis and the 250th anniversary of the founding of our city. led by archbishop carlson, the clergy of the oratory and 300-plus faithful honored king st. louis with a procession of his sacred relic.

after the sermon of archbishop carlson the celebration then continued with vespers and benediction of the most blessed sacrament. the evening ended with a joyful and festive reception in the church hall, where many faithful gathered to greet the archbishop, and to celebrate a noteworthy milestone in catholic history, a milestone that drew together a saintly old-world french king, missionaries to the new world, and our present day work toward a future filled with hope and charity.here's the link to the coverage of the local archdiocesan newspaper st. louis review.

blessed virgin - jean fouquet (1420-1481)






the oratory’s fourth annual gaudete gala will take place on gaudete sunday, december 14, 2014, at the sheldon concert hall (3648 washington blvd.) in st. louis.
 

this year, as we anticipate christmas with hope and joy, let us also share the beauty of music with one another and with friends and family. as in previous galas, we can expect a joyful, festive, and sublime performance from the oratory’s talented choristers – in st. louis’ premiere concert venue.

this year’s gala will offer a delicious hors d’oeuvres reception before the concert.

after the concert, there will be a brief opportunity to gather again to meet and greet the choir.

it is said that music is the handmaid of the liturgy, and that this bond has propelled the musical arts to great heights, from medieval times to the present day. 

since 2005, the sacred music program at st. francis de sales oratory has aimed, in our small way, to reflect this timeless bond, allowing the liturgy to inform, guide, and inspire the creativity of everyone involved in the program, from the youngest chorister to the most experienced performer.










warmly, we invite you to come to the gaudete gala to enjoy the fruits of our labor – a unique and joyful expression of love of music and love of the sacred.


come hear the voices of mere mortals converse in music, the language of angels!

the oratory would like to express our deeply felt gratitude to several supporters for their generous donations to defray the cost of the gala.

we would also like to thank mr. & mrs. david schlafly, mr. chris poehler, and ms. susan barrett for co-chairing the gaudete gala committee this year.
