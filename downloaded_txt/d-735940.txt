san fransisco
as part of my hartford art school mfa in illustration program we traveled to different cities, visited studios and heard lectures presented by regional professionals. we had to create a "reaction piece" informed by our experience in the city. this was my san fransisco reaction piece.












san fransisco thumbnail sketch 
every illustration starts with a thumbnail sketch, usually made with a pencil, sometimes on a napkin or the back of an envelope. this time i used an apple pencil on my ipad with procreate.






san fransico tight sketch
on this tight sketch, drawn in pencil, i work out the details. i scanned it and added the tone in photoshop to see the silhouette of the foreground group against the background.






san fransisco value structure
i use pencil and wash (gray water color) to render the image and work out the lights and the darks. then, i scan it and add the colors in photoshop.






san francisco photoshop layers
i add the colors in photoshop in numerous layers. some layers are set to "soft light" to unify the shadow colors of a given group or spacial area. other layers are set to "multiply" to maintain the value structure of the scanned drawing. other layers are opaque, particularly if they contain highlights.






black and white
most of these were chapter book interior illustrations.
































































































gurnimojis
these are "stickers", or my take on emojis.
