pemf and hi intensity led
pemf (pulsed electromagnetic field) therapy 
has been used for decades to help the body 
heal itself in applications ranging from pain 
relief, to accelerated wound and bone 
fracture healing.  high intensity led light also 
has a wide range of documented benefits, from body sculpting, pain relief, 
wound healing, skin tightening and many others.  we have led only 
stimulator devices (hilite and maculite) and a combined pemf/led device 
(chromomag) to provide the widest range of therapy options.
parasite zapper
dr. hulga clark demonstrated that 
certain frequencies of electrical 
energy would kill parasites such as 
live in human tissue.  we offer the qzap, which generates 4 
simultaneous frequencies combined to provide the most 
effective results.

family technologies is a family owned business 
specializing in family health 
and wellness.  for 
over 20 years we have been developing and 
producing customized software and clinical 
products to help alternative health practitioners 
assess, evaluate and support their clientâs health 
challenges.
most of our products have been crafted through a 
partnership with doctors who have expertise in 
specific fields, or who have developed new 
modalities or assessment technologies.
in all cases our goal is the sameâ¦. to develop, 
deliver and support high quality products which 
improve the health and wellness (physically and 
mentally) of families and individuals.
