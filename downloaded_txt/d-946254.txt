attention all seeders
[07 jan 2008|10:33pm]





since upgrading my site i've got a reasonable amount of monthly bandwidth to spare. that means there's no need to use my bittorrent tracker any more. if you've been seeding, thank you! you can now close the torrents, everything is available via direct download on the old site.

last chance to buy prints
[28 nov 2007|05:20am]



 photobox, the company who provide the print sales on my site are planning on phasing out their printbutton service in the near future. i don't know anyone else who offers such a great way of selling photographs, let alone one that can be integrated straight into my site. that means i have no idea when, if ever, i'll be selling these prints again. if you want to buy any while they are still available click here to head over to my old site.
