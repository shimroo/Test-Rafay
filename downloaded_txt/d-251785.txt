our history

25 years in todmorden



 
paint & paper has been at 5 halifax road, todmorden for over 25 years and was once one of two paint & decorating supplies shops in calderdale opened and owned by ken halliwell.
this was the last remaining store when ken and his wife emmy took a well-earned retirement in 2022 and the business was taken over by another local couple, leanne & mark.
leanne is an experienced painter and decorator and worked in the trade for a number of years.
more often than not it is leanne you will find working in the shop and she will be able to help and guide you to find the right paint or product for your project, many of which she now stocks after using them herself.
please feel free to ask leanne for any help and advice.
