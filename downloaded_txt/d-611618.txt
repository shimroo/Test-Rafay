connect. communicate. heal.





welcome to wild reiki and shamanic healing!
i’m rose de dan, animal communicator, reiki master teacher, shamanic energy healer, and author. my practice is dedicated to assisting animals and people live happier, healthier lives through connection, communication and energy healing.
over the years, i have encountered many animal teachers and healers—wild and domestic—who have issued a call to action for personal and global healing. at their request i build bridges reconnecting the people and the animals through classes, events, storytelling, and photos.
in practice and in partnership with my companion animals, i offer private sessions, and teach classes and workshops in reiki and shamanism worldwide from seattle, washington.







healing sessions
i offer sessions for animals of all species, blending reiki, shamanism, and animal communication which support the healing process by stimulating wellness, vitality, and balance. sessions are available by phone consultation.

reiki classes
taking a reiki class may be the single best gift you can give yourself or your loved ones, whether they walk on two legs or four, swim or fly. reiki energy healing can assist you in supporting your animal companion’s well-being, foster deeper connections with the other nations we share this world with, and help facilitate your healing and balance as you walk your path in life. see calendar for upcoming classes.
curious about reiki? in audio what is reiki? i share some cool, true stories about its benefits for animals and people and answer your questions.





shamanic classes
from shamanic classes like bones, stones, feathers and fur to ceremonies with animals for listening to zoo animal ambassadors, we offer a variety of experiences to raise awareness and foster deeper connections with all our relations. see calendar for upcoming classes.

classes and healing sessions testimonials


i feel so blessed by all that has come out of this class. it has opened doors for me beyond what i thought was possible. every day now i find myself realizing how absolutely not alone i am. i had an awareness of working with all our relations before, but my connection deepened exponentially from taking your class. i am filled with gratitude.
stacey wall, ma, from bones, stones, feathers and furit is so amazing to see how much animals love the energy and to know that i can help them in this manner! rose has been an amazing mentor and teacher providing training in reiki but also an awesome perspective that has made an impact on how i view the world and how we are all connected. i am excited to take reiki 2 soon!
s. doyne in wa, reiki level 1i’ve always been a highly sensitive person with a deep love for animals and the natural world. taking the reiki 1 teleclass has given me a toolkit to use these sensitivities in order to help others. now, instead of feeling helpless when an animal is in need, i can do something to help them. it’s also been a wonderful healing tool for myself and for loved ones.
angela d., txwhile i often send hospice animals to rose because i feel like she is very skilled at offering support and comfort during this time, i have also sent younger animals to her when i feel like i was missing something or they just need extra support in a difficult time or during illness.

“many of us feel a loss of connection, a distancing from the natural world that surrounds and maintains precarious toeholds within our cultivated, civilized areas. and so we bring the natural world into our homes—plants, fountains, dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, fish—to share our space with us. and we do this because it makes us feel good, perhaps not consciously realizing that what we seek is a return to balance, harmony, and connection with all our relations.”
—rose de dan, from tails of a healer: animals, reiki and shamanism

quotes
the buffalo are coming back…whether they are here to stay is up to us. we must want them to stay for the sake of the many generations to come, indian and wasichu alike. like the grizzly, the wolf, the sandhill crane, and the condor, these buffalo are a part of us and we are a part of them. we are all of the earth.
— james welch, foreword, bison: monarch of the plains
