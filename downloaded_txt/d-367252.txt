about the campground
frosty acres campground is nestled in the scenic hills of duanesburg, new york at 1,250 ft. above sea level.
          our campground has a spectacular view for as far as the eye can see on a clear day! secluded in the hills,
          away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. our refreshing breezes caress the hills and dispel the
          summer heat. frosty acres campsites are spaciously spread across our hills and provides the option of sunny
          or shaded campsites.
frosty acres campground also has a different theme every weekend so you can choose to camp with us on
          christmas in july weekend or maybe halloween weekend. we also have entertainment, check the weekly flyers for
          all activities and events starting memorial day weekend ending labor day weekend. frosty acres is a privately
          owned campground which offers seasonal and nightly camping arrangements. our camping season runs may though
          october.
