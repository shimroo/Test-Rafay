whether buying or selling a home, you can’t predict when a problem will arise, but they seem to happen when you’re least prepared. unplanned expenses for home repairs can ruin the vacation you have long been looking forward to or, at the very least, put a strain on the family budget. an haa warranty can give you the protection you need by covering breakdowns in major systems such as plumbing, electrical, heating and air conditioning, as well as working components such as washer, dryer, oven, refrigerator and other items. with so much that can (and will) go wrong, let an haa warranty give you your deserved peace of mind! buyer and seller coverage available. ask parker insurance & realty for complete details and an application for your haa warranty when you buy or sell a home.
