awesome and reasonably priced inn with easy access to bromley, stratton and manchester. the room itself wasn't huge but it was clean and comfortable, and had a great view of bromley mountain. the morning breakfast was cooked to order and was delicious. dogs are allowed but can't be left in the room when you leave. the staff was super friendly and helpful. we will definitely be coming back here!★★★★★
