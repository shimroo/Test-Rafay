queen mary 2 "qm2"  is the first liner to be built since qe2 35 years earlier. 
qm2 entered service in january 2004 and is the largest, longest, widest, tallest and most expensive 
passenger liner in history.


no ship has ever been designed like qm2, a liner which sets the benchmark for others, extends the 
boundaries of ship design, and which is the most powerful and fastest since cunard's own qe2. 
qm2 is a technically advanced machine far ahead of any passenger ship in service today, 
and will be so for some many years to come.
