possible relacore class action lawsuit




july 29 2004

relacore is a weight-loss supplement manufactured by the carter-reed company.  relacore's website states that "excess tummy flab is not your fault."

relacore advertisements state that relacore "is the most significant advancement in weight control in more than a decade."  relacore advertisements also state that "by including relacore in your daily routine, you will decrease mild anxiety, improve your mood, increase your energy levels and fight that mid-day fatigue we all face.  if you're looking for a natural way to fight the stress-to-belly fat cycle, you've got to try relacore."

a potential class action lawsuit is currently being investigated concerning whether relacore's advertising claims are false, deceptive or misleading.
