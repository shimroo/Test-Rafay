these guys build my friend’s house and did an exceptional job, so a few months later, when we decided to remodel our home, so we contacted gilley. the fast response was shocking for us as their team members were at our doorstep within hours. as expected, they did a great job remodeling our home and finished the project within the dedicated time and budget. 5 stars!

new residential home build




we were looking to buy land in charlotte and were driving around a neighborhood where we saw a home their team was working on. we loved the design of the house so much that we stopped the car and went to talk to their team; their builder was on-site and even knew our realtor. long story short, after we bought the land, we hired gilley’s team for the construction, and as expected, they did an exceptional job. highly recommended!
