what our members say







i'm a member of smcma because there are so many issues that doctors need to get involved in to shape the world of medicine, both for their own benefit and the benefit of their patients. that's why i got involved.  i stay involved because i love the community that we have!


barbara yates weissman, md
psychiatry, san mateo county











it may sound a bit corny, but one of the things i love about medicine is the camaraderie - the connection and support among the physician community. by sticking together we can more effectively address whatever challenges come our way, for the benefit of our patients.

smcma works to protect physicians' interests so physicians can focus on why they went into medicine in the first place - caring for their patients.
