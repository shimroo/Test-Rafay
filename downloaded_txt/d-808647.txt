                that, with a concise fret board diagram; without naming a
                note, provides a network of options through a musical structure
                that outlines the limits of classical jazz harmony in major.
                arranged for fret board convenience for an acoustic solo chord
                style.

                instructions for use of the diagrams you see at the left for 
                this improvisation style online.
this is a 
                formula that delivers jazz guitar improvisation skills through 
                the practice of just a few mental and physical exercises. the 
                countless variations of circles of 5ths that result from the 
                application of the simple logic described ahead facilitates
                improvisation far more readily than common linear styles of
                learning. the use of a musical formula designed specifically for
                the guitar rather than any number of isolated chord progressions
                opens the door to this improvisation 
                system.

                options of this jazz guitar improvisation system. remember, it 
                is a midi reproduction and instrument quality will vary with the 
                sound card quality of the computer of the listener.
the diagrams 
                displayed at the left in conjunction with their surprisingly 
                simple application (once visualized) define a complete framework 
                for this chordal improvisation style. an initial effort, both 
                physical and mental, depending on your previous experience with 
                the guitar, is needed to memorize the options to a degree of 
                fluidity but in a short time the results will become apparent.
                sized for printing diagrams are available through the 
                link above.

 the
                description of the simple use of the colored diagrams becomes
                unavoidably wordy perhaps, but once grasped, the simple logic
                for the the diagrams will be all that are needed to improvise this
                system's solo acoustic finger style and in a short time you
                won't need the diagrams either. if you have guitar skills and
                are interested in acoustic jazz, but haven't, or will not have
                time to absorb the volumes on theory, this may be an ideal
                approach and well worth the effort. the simplicity of the
                recommended use for the colored diagrams may, on the surface,
                appear too easy to be of real value but if you have playing
                experience, you'll probably realize the number of avenues that
                stem from even the use of 3 or 4 chords. the introductory and
                background material describe how the diagrams are used to access
                an abundance of chord substitution options through circles of 
                5ths.

 introduction:  >

                  
                   the chordal style described is free improvisation in
                  nature, like many instrumental breaks in modern jazz or in
                  free form acoustic jazz. it is jazz that emphasizes upper
                  chord tensions, the notes in  jazz harmony  that distinguish it
                  from conventional harmony. 

  the following improvisation composition method adheres to
                  the essentials of classical jazz harmony  while accessing a
                  broad harmonic perspective. 
  more than an isolated chord
                  progression or map of a single key, it is harmony based on the
                  circle of 5ths in motion.    knowledge of music theory or the
                  ability to read music are unnecessary to improvise with this
                  system.  
 knowledge of this system does not make a master of all forms
                  of jazz and isn't intended as a technique for improvisation 
                  with a jazz combo though the information here may certainly be 
                  of interest and useful to guitarists involved with a combo 
                  style, however, the relatively simple instructions offered
                  facilitate    improvisation through a network of options that
                  spans the limits of classical jazz harmony in major with
                  generous chord substitution options through circles of 5ths,   
                  with line progression ; melodic potential   automatically . 
                  this system's suggested chord options can be organized as 
                  cadences for composition as described in the instructions. a 
                  useful section is offered for novices; however the primary
                  intention of this presentation is it's function as an aid to
                  improvisation and composition for intermediate guitarists.

                  meter ;  key changes occur freely so please understand that
                  it is not likely that this improvisation will resemble big
                  band, ragtime, or dixie style jazz. rhythmic variation is left
                  to the ear, mood, ability and discretion of the musician. the
                  chord structures most readily lend themselves to
                  finger-picking techniques. beginning fingerpicking 
                  patterns are suggested in the help area.
built into the logic that is
                  applied to these diagrams is a broad harmonic base for
                  improvisation.

                  are some itemized ideas that relate to or are a repetition of

                experienced jazz players should find this correlation to a

                  to an average acoustic steel string. nylon string guitars and
                  electric guitars usually don't present any problems with
                  difficult fingerings. electric guitar action should be closer
                  than that of an acoustic steel string.

this fret board system allows
                  improvisation without knowledge of the theory that's touched
                  on here. for technicians though, the author's

                  to the guitar fret board is described. others may also find
