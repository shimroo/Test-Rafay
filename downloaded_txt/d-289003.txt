                    "amazing course and conditions especially for this time of year. it’s a tough layout and the first time is even rougher. if you shoot over 100 it will be a long day. bring your a game to play here. the staff and amenities are great except everything is double normal golf course prices so be ready."

                    "i've played several of the vegas courses and i think bali hai is a solid option if you're on the strip and looking for golf. the wind was up a bit and it was a strong test from the green tees (short game kept me in the 70s)."
