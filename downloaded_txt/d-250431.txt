work

i should be working but no one has really arrived yet to edit their portion of the stanford bulletin so i am workless by circumstance rather than by choice. i 'm getting really excited about moving to uc davis. i think it will be a great place to spend the end of my undergrad years, in a cute small town, living in a nice friendly bubble. then later i can move to the big bad city. i'm really excited about my change of major as well. i decided to major in evolution, ecology, and bidiversity, which is in the school of biological sciences. i'm still majoring in english as well, so i'm technically doing a double major. i still love english but i have kind of grown bored of subject...there are just so many subjects that interest me especially in the sciences. if i could i would minor in astrophysics, but i cant have a double major and a minor :( i'm still not sure what kind of career i want. i know i want to do some graduate study/research in the biological sciences..maybe marine/or oceanography. i was also thinking about a career in enviornmental law. being a college prof. still appeals to me. i know i want a career in academia. i just want a job that is exciting and that has the power to make a difference.i also applied to join a sorority. i was never really big on school spirit in highschool, i never went to a game or was a member of any club. but i want to have a different experience at davis. i feel like there are alot of things i haven't tried and i'm not the most social person, so i know the only way i'll get to do these things is if i'm in a club that is forcing me to be social. i love going camping and on snowboarding trips. i really love to try new things, but if it comes down to it, i'm not going to be the person that gets everyone to go. i need someone to push me into action. so yea i think a sorority will be fun, but i hope it isn't too "mean girls" cuz i'm not really like that...

so updatesalot of the hard part of this semester is over....several term papers have been turned in...i need to step it up in statistics, the tests and quizes we will be taking in the next few wks will account for 50 percent of our grade, so there is alot of room for dramatic improvement or failure, but i know i won't failthe rest of my classes are pretty good and have slowed downi got into ucsd, uc irvine, and uc davisi got rejected from uc santa cruz, and uc santa barbarastill waiting to hear from ucbi don't know where to goucb would be a deal breaker, but my chances of getting in are slim, which means i will most likely have to make a choice, and i hate doing thati like to keep my options open

i had a rather entertaining weekend. on sat. i saw my first bengal cat because ashley bought one. for anyone that doesn't know bengal cats look like mini cheetahs, and they don't act like the typical cat for they like water, and can be trained to play fetch and walk on a leash. if i ever have like 5,000 bucks i could just blow on anything, i would buy a safari, which is similar to the bengal cat in appearence except they get to be like 35-40 ibs. so this cat would be the size of a semi large dog,which would be sweet.later that night i went to franco and alex's goodbye party. that was a crazy party. as soon as i walked in i was informed by some intoxicated girl there was a stripper. i wasn't sure if this was a "real" stripper or just  some girl who liked to get naked. but it became apparent after the wax and lotion "tricks" she was  trained or something..and there was a body guard. from my previous experience with strippers (crazy horse) i knew to keep my distance and to not let the strippper seduce me into taking off any of my clothes, which i would never let happen, but strippers do have this effect of getting you to do things you wouldn't ordinarliy do, its like you just let things happen, at least thats how it has felt to me.the inbetweens played their last show. i felt kind of sentimental because i remember when beano, justin, and eddie first started practicing together in ashley's garage. which was way back in the day because they didn't even have a singer (cheeze) yet. i think i still have a copy of that cd somewherethen me mark and ashley started reminising about hiv and offended...all these bands that our friends had together in highschool that are no longer together.it always gives me a strange feeling when people move away. it always invokes thoughts in me, like what it will be like when i finally move away. and what it will be like way in future when old friends are reunited again, seeing how we've changed, but are still the same.i have pe in like 12 min.my mind isn't into school today, it keeps wandering and i can't control it.i'm really upset with my dad. its been building for years and this weekend was really the breaking point. i don't see how i could have lived with someone so long, and not really have a relationship with them. my dad just doesn't act like a parent. i feel like i have always been the more mature one in the relationship.i've always wanted a dad like ashley's..or someone like sandy cohen from the ocat this point i feel like cutting him out of my life entirely. like when i finally move away from home, i just know i won't keep in touch with him and vice versa, i can just see that happening.i know its harsh, but i know he doesnt worry about our relationship anyway, and i know i would be happier not having someone in my life that is always disappointing me.why keep people in your life that cause you pain?
