what is hypnogenesis all about? hypnogenesis - def/ the induction of an hypnotic state (concise oxford dictionary). the art and science of hypnosis is at once both old and new. old, because it was used in ancient times, although the modern word 'hypnosis' was coined only in the 19th century. new, because it is really only over the past 100 years has it been subject to the full force of scientific scrutiny. nowadays it's accepted that unconscious / subconscious mind, emotions and personal history directly affect the current state of mental, emotional and physical health. the medical profession as a whole is gradually moving from symptom based therapy to a more holistic approach where originating causes and emotional balance are addressed as part of treatment.  the aim of this online journal is to present hypnosis and hypnotherapy as a useful technique with which to effect rapid therapeutic effects, especially when dealing with behavioural changes and diseases of a psychogenic origin.  we will also attempt to 'de-mystify' hypnosis for those readers who have been subject to the hypnotic forces of television, cinema and certain types of fiction, which often present hypnosis as some form magical will power or trickery, when this is very far from the facts.our gratitude goes out to the many professionals who have contributed articles and information to these pages and we are always hopeful that there are articles yet to come.there is magic in the mind but it is only to be found in your own mind. with hypnosis, hypnotherapy and even self-hypnosis we can begin to use that magic for our own good ...in the hypnosis article indexes you will find a very eclectic selection of material and there is sure to be something of interest. if you don't find the article or information you are looking for you can always use the feedback form. we also aim to cover news articles in the hypnosis in the news section but these will be restricted to pieces with information content. since its launch this online journal (and its archive at hypnogenesis.com) carries articles by many professionals in the field and the number is growing. we also want to present free hypnosis downloads so people can try self-hypnosis at their leisure and sample the type of thing that's on offer. it's a good idea to call back from time to time to check for new material - perhaps you should bookmark this page?if you are a professional in this field you may wish to contribute to this web site and help our aim of de-mystifying and presenting the benefits of hypnosis and hypnotherapy.
