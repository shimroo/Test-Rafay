casa delfino is a boutique hotel which once 
was the house of the delfino family










 scroll down 



casa delfino has been in the same family for six generations. hospitality and authentic charm are an important part of our heritage. paying homage to the history of the building, all the areas have been meticulously restored to its original splendor.

casa delfino has evolved into a historical hotel where all the desires of the modern traveller are fulfilled, but the charm and refined elegance remain unchanged. with just 24 guestrooms and suites, decorated with a mix of modern and classical décor and furnishings; each room has its own individual character and style. all rooms seamlessly weave architectural heritage with contemporary design.
from tailor-made itineraries to unexpected treats at turndown, we love to spoil our guests. casa delfino’s pebbled courtyard is a romantic oasis where guests can read, relax, or simply soak up the serene ambience. the hotel is located in the heart of the walled old venetian town, enabling a glimpse into the past. yet, step outside this enchanted setting and you can stroll to all the main attractions, museums, restaurants, chic shops, and lively bars.
simplicity, tranquility and time. these elements are so often missing in our frenetic modern lives. wouldn’t a little luxurious down-time at the spa be sheer perfection? pampering and sheer indulgence…every moment of it catered to your every need. and when the sun goes down enjoy a drink at the spectacular roof terrace. with its sensational views over the harbor and the sea, there’s no better place to be at sunset.
casa delfino is open all year round.
