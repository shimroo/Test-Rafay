 religious education



weâve moved! ipre website now integrated into new ignatius.com website!



              our religious education website for schools and parishes has moved to become an integrated
              part of our main website: ignatius.com, but
              donât worry, special school and parish pricing will still be available.  please read the
              important faqs and answers below before going to ignatius.com
              to place your order.
            




                    q.  what happened to my existing ipre website account sign in information?



                  	a. most existing school / parish website accounts and log ins were transferred 
			toâ ignatius.com. our new 
			platform only allowed one username sign in to be transferred on the same main account, 
			so if your church/school had multiple website log ins, only one was transferred. if 
			you desire more than one log in, please use the button at the bottom of this page to 
			request an additional website account.
		  





                    q.  will i still get special school/parish discounts on the new website?



                	a. yes! our special discounts for schools and parishes are available to you on our
			new website platform.
		





                    q.  can i still place orders on our account without paying by credit card?



                	a. yes! choose the bill my account option during checkout. only available to
			transferred ipre website accounts or school and parish accounts we set up for you.
			use the button at bottom of page to request a school or parish account if you donât
			have one yet.  
		





                    q.  as a new ipre customer, can i create a new school/parish account online to
                    get the special school/parish discounts?



                	a. yes. use the âi would like to set up a new website
			account for a school/parishâ button below.  
		







                i am a school/parish with an existing ipre website account.
              



i would like to set up a new website account for a school/parish.
