our wheelchair accessible real estate listings
barrier-free home is a “one-stop-shop” for barrier-free homes, townhomes and condominiums.
read about barrier-free home in the washington post!

with extensive data on each property, photographs and feature lists, finding a wheelchair-accessible home becomes much easier. if you are a real esate agent, realtor® or a property owner, barrier-free home encourages you to advertise your universal design property to our large, interested audience. with a clean, understandable user interface, low advertising rates and a large list of features, barrier-free home can help both buyers and sellers of barrier-free homes.
if you have mobility limitations or are physically disabled, barrier-free home can help you find a suitable accessible home. since there is no overarching law that requires the construction of barrier-free homes, growth in this segment is sporadic and driven by the individual home buyer's needs. thus there is no guarantee that a home labeled as wheelchair-accessible meets the requirements of the ada (or va requirements). because of this, it is difficult to know if a home will be suitable without visiting it.
barrier-free home is a site devoted to the wheelchair-accessible, universal design, ada or barrier-free home, townhome and condominium market.
