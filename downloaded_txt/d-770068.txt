honolulu is a beautiful place to live, but a horrible place to be homeless.  honolulu police are officially cracking down on homelessness at the direction of the mayor. they are confiscating personal belongings, closing public parks at night, banning tents and lean-tos in public spaces, imposing fines for public urination/defecation, and rousting those from sleep on the sidewalks.

americans' level of worry--independents 2014





this is a march gallup survey on the concerns of independent americans about  national problems (people who do not register as democrats or republicans).  it is interesting to note that hunger and  homelessness is sixth and unemployment is fifth.  if our legislators  went to work every day just to work on the top ten issues exclusively,  we might be able to solve some these intractable issues in our  society.

no bathrooms in downtown cleveland 





we received a complaint from a friend of the coalition about a woman relieving herself behind a vehicle near the financial district of downtown cleveland (between east 6th st. and east 9th st. in the old short north).   she was shocked that this homeless woman was outside using the bathroom.   i asked one of the full time social workers helping people in the downtown area where people could go to use the bathroom.  here is her response: "the answer is the library, city/county buildings with id, the courthouses, and justice center. all other buildings are private."  we have basically six locations downtown with public restrooms and two require id and all require going through a metal detector.

a wisconsin judge has struck down the state law requiring the showing

about  national problems (people who do not register as democrats or

also interesting to note that issues that are at the  top of national

an update on the national coalition for the homeless





 the national coalition for the homeless
 has a new director, a new website, some new board members and a renewed
 focus on community organizing and building a movement around housing 
and homelessness.  there are so many national groups focused on 
homelessness, but nch has a 30 year history of focusing on civil rights 
and representing the interests of those living in shelters or on the 
streets.  they have a strong past including leading the passage of the 
mckinney vento legislation that protects homeless children and funds all
 the shelters.  they have fought against laws directed at homeless 
people and raised awareness about hate crimes against those who spend 
time sleeping outside.

coordinated intake hurts privately funded shelters





the plain dealer did a really nice overview of the problems homeless people are facing if they go to a private shelter
 before they go to the central intake site in cleveland.  this is a huge
 issue that has brought republican and democratic lawmakers together to 
question this policy.  democrats fudge, kaptur and senator brown as well
 as republican rob portman have all written to the federal agency 
funding all these services to ask for a clear explanation.

training for those who minister to those outside





if you belong to a church that goes out to feed homeless people or a 
student group that goes to the streets of cleveland to help those 
sleeping rough, we have a training opportunity for you.  we have a group
 of experienced outreach workers who will provide resource information 
and answer questions based on their years of service.  they will talk 
about ethical issues and the philosophy of serving those outside. 
it is tough to build a trusting relationship with those who have 
nearly given up on society.  many have faced tough times and have seen 
the system fail for them.  others have made huge errors in judgement 
that they are not willing to admit.

update on ohio housing trust fund





the coalition on homelessness and housing in ohio
 has been leading the charge to lift the cap on the ohio housing trust 
fund.  at the march cohhio conference, bill faith announced that they 
had made progress with an amendment to lift the cap on the ohio housing trust fund.
 the amendment had been included by rep. ryan smith (r-bidwell) in a 
piece of legislation known as the mid-biennium review, hb 483. 
previously, the money raised from the local recorders fee when property 
transfers goes into the ohio housing trust fund to build and preserve 
affordable housing.   for years, ohio has capped the revenue at $50 
million with the rest going to the state's general revenue account.

discrimination report issued by national coalition





the national coalition for the homeless has issued a briefing paper this week in washington dc on the opinions of homeless people in the
 nation's capital.  this was a summer project by students at george 
washington university to interview homeless people about their treatment
 that they receive by law enforcement, private businesses, medical 
services and social services.

widely described as having discriminating against homeless people.

hud rejected our appeal regarding coordinated intake





in april 2013, the county decided that anyone who does not go to the 
coordinated intake first would not be considered homeless and therefore 
not have access to the rest of the services in the community.  for men, 
you have to go to 2100 lakeside shelter first before going to any other 
facility in the community for assistance with your homelessness.  women 
and women with children must start their journey at the norma herr 
center at 2227 payne ave.  if they go to one of the privately funded 
shelters in the community before going to coordinated intake, they lose 
their ability to access rental assistance, transitional housing or any 
other publicly funded homeless service.

we had a meeting with many outreach workers and volunteers along with 
some of the victims of the fires down in the flats and the cleveland 
police department.  the new commander of the second district thomas 
stacho and officer petcak from the downtown unit attended the meeting to
 hear our concerns that someone was targeting homeless people by burning
 down their campsites.  we heard of three active sites that were 
destroyed and a couple of abandoned camps.  this started the weekend of 
march 21 and continued last friday march 28.   on friday evening between
 4 pm to 5 p.m.  there were a series of fires at the camps while they

hate crime attack on homeless encampments





the homeless stroller lady is famous in cleveland.  you have probably
 seen her on a bus or walking around downtown, and some have even called
 the police worried that she has a baby in the stroller (she does 
not).   this weekend her campsite and two others were attacked in the 
flats.  there were three or four tents set on fire over the weekend.  
this is a terrifying prospect with all those flamable blankets lining 
the tents. 
the stroller lady had gone to the president of a local construction 
company and received written permission to take scrap wood from the 
construction site for her campsite.

neoch about printing the street newspaper that they were calling the homeless grapevine
 21 years ago.   angelo has been a long term speaker for our street 
voices program.  he raised himself out of homelessness to join the neoch
 staff and then became staff at the salvation army/lutheran metro 
ministry main men's shelter in cleveland.  this is a short promo for the

award winners at the neoch annual meeting





the board of directors of the northeast ohio coalition for the homeless 
presented the advocate of the year award to eileen kelly at the annual 
meeting on march 19.  we also gave the david westcott volunteer of the 
year award to kimberly fischer for her outstanding work last year.  
eileen kelly invited a number of st. colman friends with her to the 
annual meeting to help celebrate her social justice award.   kelly 
helped start the identification collaborative in cleveland nearly 10 
years ago, and they have served thousands.   last year, kelly did a 
great deal of work trying to get the social security administration and 
the bureau of motor vehicles in protecting access to identification for 
homeless people.  this year the hard work begins of trying to raise 
enough funds to keep the project going.

ione biggs award winners





jay westbrook and maria smith were honored by the homeless coalition 
as the 2013 and 2012 ione biggs social justice award winners 
respectfully.  we presented them with a plaque that they can display on 
their office wall.  we also have a recognition plaque in the office with
 the engraved names of the previous winners. we keep ione biggs name 
alive in cleveland with this social justice award, and each of the 
winners knew ms. biggs and were fans of her advocacy and dignity.
for those who do not know, ione biggs was one of the first female 
police officers in ohio.  she had a long history of fighting for the 
rights of women especially women of color.

annual report posted on our website





we had a really nice annual meeting on wednesday night with a full 
house of over 40 people.  we were proud to give lifetime achievements to
 maria smith and retired councilman jay westbrook as the 2012 and 2013 
ione biggs social justice award winners. both graciously tried to find 
others who deserved the award more than they did, but we finally 
convinced each to accept the award.  it was nice that both knew ms. 
biggs before she passed away. 
we had some good food (thanks jennifer) and around 40 people attended the annual meeting.

two related stories on the criminal justice system





there were a strange group of articles in the paper that point to the 
two different approaches to the criminal justice system in america.  the
 justice department announced a change in the sentencing recommendations for drug offenses then on the other end the plain dealer had a story that the governor was
 asking for additional criminal justice money because they are running 
out of space in the jails.  attorney general eric holder is asking for a
 reduction in the range of sentences for federal drug crimes.  at the 
same time, he is requesting that federal prosecutors not object to 
requests for sentencing reductions.  this will affect nearly 70% of the 
drug trafficking cases in the federal courts. here is the npr report on the issue.

at least we don't live in columbus





we have real problems with diversion as part of central intake mostly 
based on concerns of women at the shelter.   we do not believe that it 
is ever a good idea to return a woman to the place she was last night if
 there is a possibility that the women will experience domestic 
violence.   the county is following a trend in the united states to 
interview people and ask them where they slept last night, and then try 
to negotiate a place to stay with family, friends or landlord that is 
not in the shelters.  this is called diversion and it is the latest 
trend out of washington dc.  over 20% of the people do not get a shelter
 bed and are relocated back to the community.   i am skeptical that a 
victim of domestic violence would tell a total stranger that she is 
being abused if she is embarrassed or ashamed that she has stayed with 
the abuser for an extended period of time.

national news updates





new york city

the new police chief of new york city, bill bratton, has tripled
 the number of arrests for panhandling as was done in the first two 
months of 2012.  this is a crackdown on those who sit by the subway 
asking for change which is annoying, but these guys need the help.  i 
have never understood giving people who are down on their luck a ticket 
for begging for money.  this seems like kicking a man when he is down.  
do they allow these guys to beg for the fine that they will be charged 
for asking for help?   unless you provide an alternative for these poor 
people it will only perpetuate the problem.

radio program featured a discussion on voting





this morning on wcpn 90.3 was another good sound of ideas radio program
 on voting rights in ohio.   mike mcintyre did a good job trying to move
 beyond the spin and talking points regarding the big changes taking 
place in ohio regarding voting.  it was nice that he asked secretary of 
state jon husted my question that i submitted about the market wanting 
weekend voting and golden week voting so why won't government respond to
 the people instead of saying we have to respond to government?   he 
also asked subodh's question about disenfranchisement of african 
american voters in large urban communities.   we never got to hear a 
debate about large populations like cuyahoga county not being able to 
get the 700,000 registered voters through the lines when we have the 
same hours as the 14,000 voters in van wert county.

more limits on voting in ohio





a number of editorial boards have condemned these voter suppression bills. the plain dealer editorial is here. toledo blade has weighed in
 opposing the changes in february.  democrats all opposed the changes, 
and have threatened lawsuits.  it looks like we will again spend the 
spring and summer engaged in many lawsuits over the process of casting a
 ballot in ohio.  there is a perception that all these changes are being
 done for purely political reasons.   the picture on the side of this 
story is the line at the cuyahoga board of elections on the sunday 
before the november election in 2012.  these lines were replicated all 
over the state showing that there was demand for sunday voting.

neoch annual meeting 3/19/2014





we have not given out the ione biggs award for a few years.  we 
typically gave them out during our annual fund raiser.  since we are 
doing that event differently with the handup gala, we have not really 
had a good venue to give out these social justice awards.   this year, 
we decided that we need to give out this important award again.  we are 
going to recognize the long career of both legal aid lawyer maria smith 
and retired councilman jay westbrook.

housing 101 workshop





here is a copy of the flyer that you can print out or distribute to your co-workers.

we are starting our housing workshops for 2014.  we hope to have four
 this year.   these will help housing case workers learn more about the 
resources available to homeless people.  we will discuss the landlord 
tenant law and the fair housing laws.  we will talk about appeals and 
denials from subsidized properties, and how to better use 
housingcleveland.org.   there are big changes in how homeless people 
access shelter and permanent supportive housing, and we will have the 
agency responsible for these programs present.  you must send in or drop
 off your reservation (with payment) at 3631 perkins ave. suite #3a-3, 
cleveland, ohio 44114.

golden week and early voting curtailed





we the people of ohio have to wonder what is the reason that we are not 
allowed to vote in the evening in person?  if government is supposed to 
act more like the business world then why are they not filling the 
demand for weekend and evening voting?   these were all busy times for 
early voting in cuyahoga counties and other urban centers.  government 
should respond to the needs of its citizens--not force the people to 
meet the needs of employees of rural boards of elections.   in another example of fixing a problem that does not exist,  secretary of state husted has decided to limit early in person voting to consistent hours throughout the state.
