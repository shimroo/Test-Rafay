jordan's king agrees to take in gazans





it looks like donald trump's efforts to get a country like jordan to take in gazans is beginning to bear fruit:
king abdullah ii of jordan visited president donald trump at the white house on tuesday, where the jordanian king agreed to accept refugees into his country.

the meeting comes after trump made repeated demands for jordan and egypt to take in refugees, despite both countries declining. trump and abdullah met to discuss issues including trump’s gaza proposal, the israeli-palestinian conflict, isis and al-qaeda, and economic cooperation.

the king and crown prince of jordan arrived at the white house around noon tuesday afternoon, where they both attended a bilateral meeting and lunch with the president. secretary of state marco rubio also attended the meeting — the first official encounter between the king of jordan and the president of the united states since hamas and israel agreed to a ceasefire. [...]

king abdullah said he is open to coming up with solutions that serve the interests of all parties.

“i think the point is how do we make this work in a way that is good for everybody. obviously, we have to look at the best interests of the united states, of the people in the region, and especially my people of jordan.”

abdullah offered to take 2,000 sick children from the gaza strip almost immediately.

trump called the gesture “beautiful.”

“we really appreciate it,” trump said. “it’s music to my ears.”

king abdullah said he wants to wait for the egyptians to present their plan on how to address the challenges in gaza.

trump said he believes there is a 99% chance he will work something out with egypt. the president previously threatened to withhold aid to the two countries unless a deal could be made, but backed down during the meeting, stating “i do think we’re above that.”
so far, egypt's premier, al-sisi, has been balking at cooperating. but hopefully, that too will be worked out, and egypt should by all means start accepting muslims in gaza into their country. and if aid needs to be withheld to make clear what they should do, then perhaps that's the best thing to do.

3 hostages of hamas were kept underground





new details of 3 more hostages freed from the captivity of hamas tells of the horrible situation they were in:
what happened to the hostages during 491 days in hell of gaza? with the return of ohad ben ami, ori levi, and eli sharabi from hamas captivity on saturday, new details are emerging about their harrowing ordeal, both psychologically and physically, as evidenced by the images that shocked the world.

the three hostages were held in severe conditions, according to their testimonies. for most of their captivity, they were given very little food kept in underground tunnels without exposure to daylight. they stated that they had no way of knowing whether it was summer or winter outside.

their access to media was extremely limited, with al jazeera being the primary source of news they were exposed to. they were given very little food, and even when they did receive meals, the nutrition provided was insufficient to meet their bodily needs, leading to extreme weight loss.

the hostages recounted that in the days leading up to their release, they were given slightly more food in an apparent attempt to create the illusion that their captivity conditions had been adequate. however, when they emerged, they appeared frail and emaciated, reflecting the true reality of their ordeal.

according to a source at sheba medical center, levi and sharabi were unaware that their family members had been murdered. levi's wife, einav, was killed in the "death shelter" at the nova festival, while sharabi's wife and three daughters were also murdered. the body of his brother, yossi, is still in gaza. the two were informed of their loved ones' fate by psychologists who spoke to them at the reception point in re'im.
it's all absolutely abominable.

why steve witkoff cannot remain an envoy





melanie phillips has taken valid issue with donald trump's middle east envoy, steve witkoff, who's already led to the rightfully controversial release of convicted jihadists for freeing israeli hostages of hamas:
steve witkoff, president donald trump’s special envoy to the middle east, has called the israel-hamas ceasefire deal an “inflection point” for peace in the middle east.

he told fox news that he hopes to broaden the abraham accords by bringing in every state in the middle east, including qatar and egypt, which he praised for their key roles in negotiating the gaza ceasefire.

qatar, he said, had been “enormously helpful in this,” and the communication skills of its prime minister, sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani, had been “indispensable”.

while the commitment of the new administration to expanding the abraham accords — signed in 2020 under the first trump administration — is a welcome sign, witkoff’s remarks should provoke no little unease among those who properly understand what israel is facing.

qatar can never be a solution in the middle east because qatar is the problem. far from being instrumental in bringing peace and security to israel, qatar has been instrumental in bringing it mass slaughter.

for qatar is behind hamas. it created it, funds it and protects its leaders. qatar promotes the muslim brotherhood — the jihadi parent of hamas — and hosts the islamist propaganda news outlet al jazeera.

it’s an enemy of the west because it is governed by an islamist regime that allies itself with other islamist enemies of the west including al-qaeda, isis —and syria’s new leader, ahmed al-sharaa, who had until last month a $10 million us bounty on his head.
even daniel greenfield's taken issue with witkoff's conduct:
in my article early last week, “trump should pull out of gaza nation building”, i warned that this was coming.
if the trump administration backs the deal, it will be forced to act as a ‘guarantor’ which will not only mean protecting hamas, but an extended terrorist nation-building program bigger even than iraq or afghanistan. phase 3 of the deal reportedly calls for a 3-5 year rebuilding program.

that timetable would have president trump spend his whole second term rebuilding gaza.

and the un’s actual numbers are far worse. the un development program is estimating $50 billion in costs to rebuild gaza by 2040

steven witkoff, the real estate guy with a history of previous dealings with hamas’s state sponsors in qatar, appointed by president trump to act as his middle east envoy, is now parroting the un’s numbers.
witkoff, a real estate developer, assesses that the demolition and moving of the debris alone will take five years.

“there has been this perception we can get to a solid plan for gaza in five years. but its impossible. this is a 10 to 15 year rebuilding plan,” he said.

that 15-year plan would put it at… 2040.

what that means is the u.s. would be dragged into this nation-building project in gaza for president trump’s entire second term and for, if he should get them, j.d. vance’s two terms in office.

madness.
it would also be abuse of the usa citizenry's taxpayer dollars. witkoff cannot remain in the position he's been given. he's an embarrassment and has already caused plenty of damage that can be avoided. not to mention that people as barbaric as the muslims in gaza turned out to be don't deserve to live there.

more hostages released, but not without horrifying abuse along the way





some more hostages were freed from hamas, including non-israelis from thailand, but the hamas allowed violent crowds to abuse the prisoners along the way:
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu dropped the hammer in response to what he described as "shocking scenes" when terrorists released hostages on thursday.

terrorists released israeli and thai hostages on thursday, but israeli president isaac herzog noted in a post on x that "the scenes of abuse and terror towards the hostages as they were transferred to the red cross were horrifying …"

netanyahu responded by ordering a delay in the planned release of terrorists, demanding assurance regarding the release of hostages, but the prime minister's office later indicated that the demand had been satisfied.

"prime minister benjamin netanyahu, together with defense minister israel katz, has ordered that the release of the terrorists slated to be released today be delayed until the safe exit of our hostages in the next phases is assured. israel demands that the mediators see to this," the office noted on x.

but it later seemed to indicate that the issue had been resolved, stating, "pursuant to prime minister benjamin netanyahu's demand, the mediators have conveyed a commitment, according to which the safe exit of our hostages who are due to be released in the next phases has been assured." it added, "israel insists that the lessons be learned and that strict care be taken in the next phases regarding the safe return of our hostages."

netanyahu had indicated there were "shocking scenes" when the hostages were released.

"i view with utmost severity the shocking scenes during the release of our hostages. this is additional proof of the inconceivable brutality of the hamas terrorist organization," netanyahu noted, according to the prime minister's office. "i demand that the mediators make certain that such terrible scenes do not recur, and guarantee the safety of our hostages. whoever dares to harm our hostages will pay the price."
this is just one more reason why all these mohammedans, as they were once described even by george washington, cannot remain in the area.

here's more on the subject by brendan o'neill.

update: donald trump continues to make important points why jordan and egypt should take in these muslims from gaza. and here's more about freed hostage arbel yehud, and the thais who were freed as well.

released hostages receive recovery treatment, and 4 more were released too





the 3 hostages released in the past week are now undergoing recovery treatment for returning to regular life:
on their second day of freedom at sheba medical center, three recently released hostages – doron steinbrecher, emily damari, and romi gonen – are undergoing a carefully orchestrated reintegration process, beginning with the restoration of their official identities through new biometric documentation.

the interior ministry has established a mobile processing station within the hospital, where the three will have their photographs taken and fingerprints collected for new identification cards. this procedural milestone follows scheduled sessions with hairdressers and aestheticians, marking their transition back to civilian life.

authorities have implemented comprehensive security protocols at the facility, maintaining a controlled environment where immediate family members – parents and siblings – are accommodated overnight. access remains strictly limited, with conventional smartphones prohibited; only basic "kosher phones" without cameras are permitted within the complex.

medical staff report that the released hostages, who shared their captivity experience, have maintained the close bonds formed during their ordeal. they occupy adjacent rooms in a secured wing of the facility, dividing their time between family visits and group interactions. sleeping arrangements have been customized to individual preferences, with some choosing to have family members nearby while others opted for separate accommodations.
now, it also appears 4 out of 5 more hostages who were army officials were released:
four of the five idf lookouts kidnapped during the october 7 massacre from the nahal oz military post were released from hamas captivity on saturday.

liri albag (19), naama levy (20), karina ariev (20), and daniella gilboa (20), were brought to israel from gaza by the red cross - the same red cross which refused to visit them during the 15 months they were held in captivity.

in a cynical and brutal act by the hamas terror organization, the four hostages were turned over to the red cross at the center of falastin square in gaza, as the square was full of terrorists watching. [...]

a fifth lookout, agam berger, is still held by hamas.

agam's family said, "we thank the people of israel for their warm embrace. we are overjoyed and moved by the return of our four girls home - we are all one big family! we eagerly await embracing agam, god willing, in the coming week. we will not rest until all hostages are safely returned home."
it remains to be seen what levy thinks of islam now, recalling she was reportedly an apologist and perpetuated the "palestine" fabrication that's meant to delegitimize israel. why, what does she even think of those muslims in gaza who celebrated september 11, 2001?

update: everyone's still rightfully worried about the fate of the family of kfir bibas.

3 female hostages released





finally, 3 hostages of hamas in gaza were released:
6:24 p.m.: the idf has confirmed that the three released hostages have arrived at the initial reception point in southern israel, where they will be reunited with their mothers.

idf officers from the manpower directorate and idf medical officials are accompanying the released hostages during an initial medical assessment.

idf representatives are accompanying their families at the hospital and updating them with the latest available information.
according to this article, one of the hostages, emily damari, lost 2 of her fingers on her left hand:
damari and the other two hostages romi gonen and doron steinbrecher, released after 471 days in hamas captivity, are undergoing initial medical assessments at the army facility, and they will soon be taken to a hospital.

the images show a bandage on emily’s hand after she was wounded during hamas’s october 7, 2023, attack on southern israel. smiling, she holds up her bandaged hand as she waves.

according to damari’s family, emily lost two fingers after being shot by hamas terrorists during the onslaught.
it's terrible that happened, and she and the 2 others freed are lucky to have survived over a year in captivity.

jean-marie le pen dies at 96





the french politician who was sadly one of the most antisemitic creeps of his time has died at age 96:
jean-marie le pen, the former leader of the french national front party, presidential candidate, member of the european parliament, and patriarch of the le pen political family dynasty, has died at the age of 96.

a figure who loomed large over french politics over the past five decades, mr le pen was hailed tuesday by his supporters as a fearless “patriot” and derided by his detractors as a fascist and an antisemite.
tragically, he was. and despite any claims to the contrary, he wasn't really opposed to islam any more than jean-luc melanchon was. as a result, his supposed opposition to mass migration was all a sham, and besides, when somebody like that gets chummy with despots like the late saddam hussein, something is terribly wrong.
in a moment of historical coincidence, le pen’s death was announced on the day that france marked the tenth anniversary of the islamist attack on the offices of the satirical charlie hebdo magazine, in which two algerian jihadists shot and killed 12 people and injured 11 more in reprisal for the magazine publishing a caricature of mohammed.

after reiterating his belief that the holocaust was a “detail” in 2015, the party he founded voted to expel him, and two years later, his daughter marine le pen renamed the party to the national rally (rassemblement national) in a bid to distance herself and the party from her father’s legacy. their relationship never fully recovered after the split.

while he cast the move as politically suicidal, marine le pen has grown the party to the largest in the french parliament. she currently stands as the frontrunner to replace emmanuel macron as president of the republic when his second and final term ends in 2027. [...]

far-left leader jean-luc mélenchon said that “respect for the dignity of the dead and the grief of their loved ones does not erase the right to judge their actions,” accusing le pen of spreading “hatred, racism, islamophobia, and antisemitism.”
also notice how melenchon repeats the morally equivalent cliche of blurring the difference between "islamophobia" and antisemitism, which he himself has been just as guilty of. there's just no excuse.
julian jackson notes how jean-marie le pen did little more than poison french/european politics, and unfortunately, he did do only so much to damage efforts to oppose the spread of islamofascism. i seriously doubt he even wanted to defend charlie hebdo's own freedom of speech. he won't be missed, and it's to be hoped his departure will help improve the landscape again one day.

the death of the 'progressive moment' 





i don't know if we're talking about just a "moment." we should be burying a movement. and they're not "progressives." they're leftists, communists. let's see them decimated over the next four years --- and beyond.at the wall street journal, "the progressive moment in global politics is over":weak economic growth and record immigration are driving gains by the right, especially populists.
the progressive moment is over—at least for now. 

this past year showed that the progressive politics that dominated most industrialized countries over the past two decades or more is shifting to the right, fueled by working-class anxieties over the economy and immigration, and growing fatigue with issues from climate change to identity politics.

the return of donald trump to the white house is the most dramatic and important example—but it is far from the only one.

across europe, where economic growth has largely stalled, conservatives and populist right-wing parties are making unprecedented gains. three-quarters of governments in the european union are either led by a right-of-center party or are ruled by a coalition that includes at least one.

the shift is set to continue. canada appears poised to kick out a deeply unpopular progressive prime minister and germany is expected to dump its center-left government. polls show the top two parties in germany represent the center-right and the far-right. 

part of the shift is the normal pendulum of politics swinging back and forth between established parties on the left and right. the difference this time is a strong strain of populism and a growing rejection of traditional parties. 

in country after country, many working-class voters—especially those outside the biggest cities—are signaling the same thing: they mistrust the establishment—from academics to bankers to traditional politicians—and feel these elites are out of touch and don’t care about people like them.

years of increased migration and trade, coupled with low economic growth, have led to a backlash and a rise in nationalism, where people want more of a sense of control, political analysts say. the rise of social media has exacerbated divisions and led to an upsurge in antiestablishment parties. 

“it’s a broad shift that goes across countries,” said ruy teixeira, a lifelong democrat who now works for the center-right american enterprise institute think tank. “working-class people are just pissed off—about immigration, about all the culture war stuff, and the relatively poor economic performance that has shaped the working-class experience in the 21st century.” 

while one of the two establishment parties won in the u.s., the republicans have largely been taken over by the insurgent figure of trump, who clearly has a mandate from voters to shake things up, said teixeira. he said he doesn’t see either the left or conventional right easily recapturing trump’s populist, multiracial working-class majority. 

in canada, prime minister justin trudeau’s center-left liberal party looks to be careening toward a decisive election loss, trailing the conservative party by roughly 20 points in opinion polls. trudeau must hold a vote by october 2025...more.and for canada, see, "trudeau to resign as voters sour on his vision for canada."plus, at instapundit, "well, bye." and bcf, "justin trudeau has quit. will the legacy he built survive? … well it will take time to rebuild the ruined nation he leaves behind so there’s that."

nyc allows march supporting intifada





just a short time after the terrorist attack in new orleans, a march by islamic terror supporters took place in new york city at times square, calling for another intifada (via breitbart):
several hundred demonstrators called for an intifada on wednesday at an anti-israel protest in new york city’s times square to mark new year’s day.

attendees chanted “resistance is glorious — we will be victorious,” “we will honor all our martyrs,” and “gaza, you make us proud.” they carried signs that said “zionism is cancer,” “no war on iran,” and “end all us aid to israel.”

“there is only one solution — intifada revolution,” they chanted, using a common refrain at anti-israel rallies in the us. “intifada,” arabic for “uprising,” is associated with the second intifada, a period of terror attacks in israel in the early 2000s marked by suicide bombings.

speakers at the wednesday rally urged attendees to recommit to anti-israel activism in the new year.

“2024 was a year of struggle against the crime of zionism,” a speaker told the crowd. “we will be here every single year for generation after generation until total liberation and return.” [...]

a handful of pro-israel counter-protesters showed up to wave israeli and american flags on the sidelines of the demonstration, while heckling the anti-israel activists. a jewish retiree led chants of “get a job” directed at the protesters.

arguments broke out between the two sides situated on opposite sides of a metal barrier. one anti-israel protester shouted “hamas,” “go back to europe” and “you’re all white people” at the pro-israel demonstrators, and hurled racist slurs at a black member of the pro-israel group.
nyc, as it's been in the last decade or so, has really sunk to new lows if they allow this, which amounts to little more than exploitation of "free speech rights" as an excuse to espouse pro-violence slogans. all the officials in charge of the big apple have done is let their city become infested with vermin, much like europe itself. this will have tragic consequences in the future.

a jihadist from texas committed a terrorist attack in new orleans





a terrorist attack occurred near bourbon street in new orleans, louisiana, as a muslim from texas murdered 10 people celebrating new year's eve with a ford truck (hat tip: breitbart):
the suspect accused of plowing a truck through a crowd on bourbon street early wednesday morning has been identified by a law enforcement source and confirmed by the fbi as 42-year-old shamsud-din jabbar.
police fatally shot him after the attack, which killed 10 people and injured 35.

the fbi said in a statement midday wednesday that jabbar is a u.s. citizen from texas.

the fbi confirmed that jabbar was carrying an isis flag in the truck, and authorities have said he was dressed in military gear. the fbi said they also found weapons and a potential ied were located in his vehicle.

jabbar was driving a ford pickup truck. the fbi said the truck appeared to be rented.

law enforcement said they are investigating the possibility that the attack involved multiple suspects. they are looking into whether a different suspect rented the truck used in the attack.
a prominent fbi official used the now classic cliche that it "wasn't a terrorist attack". even though some explosive devices were found, and the mayor of new orleans made clear it was a terrorist attack. this is absolutely terrible, and makes clear the usa must combat the problem of jihadists living within.

update: the daily wire found that the criminal donated to democrats.

muslim gulf states buy real estate near the district of columbia





while most conservatives' attention may have been focused upon china's buying of real estate in the usa, it would seem little attention's been given to how islamic countries like qatar and the uae have been doing the same:
arab gulf states have quietly and sometimes secretly purchased at least $282 million worth of real estate in washington’s most elite neighborhood.

situated high atop the banks of the potomac river and overlooking the nation’s capital, virginia’s “gold coast” has long been the home of america’s ruling class. today, it’s home to a number of high-profile washingtonians, including secretary of state antony blinken, whose home on arlington’s tony chain bridge road has been swarmed by an encampment of anti-israel protesters since hamas’s october 7th invasion of israel.

but since 2019, a mysterious entity called 600 cbr llc has been buying up property in the area, building up a compound that sold for three times as much as jeff bezos’ $23 million d.c. mansion. though the buyers behind 600 cbr are unknown, the real estate blog urbanturf reported in 2022 that “the buyer is from the united arab emirates and that settlement documents confirm this.”

the embassy of the united arab emirates owns extensive property just down the block from the 600 cbr compound, and the compound’s primary residence is directly across the street from blinken’s $5 million home. since october 7th, anti-israel protesters have been living in the narrow strip between the road and the llc’s property, with their tents, signs, and buckets of fake blood just inches from its fence.

it is unclear whether the various arab nations who own the properties are involved in the protests outside blinken’s home, which the daily wire reported likely violate several state and local laws. the uae embassy did not answer questions from the daily wire about whether uae royals are behind the purchase, nor their stance on the protest outside blinken’s home.

[...] the embassy of the state of qatar’s nearby compound is assessed to be worth $20 million. the oil-rich nation has just 300,000 citizens—half the size of the district of columbia—but recently counted 2 million residents. the vast majority of its residents are foreign laborers working in conditions sometimes described as “modern slavery.”

qatar has been in the international spotlight since hamas’s invasion of israel. the terrorist group’s leaders operate out of qatar, and the nation’s representative to the arab parliament said “there can be no peace or negotiations with the zionist entity.” qatar has also enmeshed itself into d.c.’s culture by becoming part-owner of the washington capitals and washington wizards.
this news certainly does make clear the whole notion the uae and saudi arabia have improved, morally or otherwise, is still far from being so. the question now is whether anything can be done to reverse the situation. this is disturbing and can't be taken lightly. even in europe, there's only so much of this that can't be overlooked.

why nation-building in afghanistan only wound up failing





here's an excerpt from jesse petrilla's recent book, "if it takes a thousand years: from al-qaeda to hamas, how the jihadists think & how to defeat them", which explains why, so long as islam rules countries like afghanistan, nation-building there won't be possible:
i was serving in the u.s. army as a liaison officer to the afghan secret police, and facilitated the interrogations of over 400 captured taliban and al-qa’eda members while there. a taliban leader once told me “you have me in a cage, my fight is over for now, but my children will fight you, and if they don’t win, their children will fight you. if it takes a thousand years, we will win.” although it didn’t take the taliban a thousand years to win the battle of afghanistan, it demonstrates the drive that our jihadist enemies have. they fight generational wars against the west as a whole.

when analyzing our islamic extremist enemies, it is important for the american people to understand the tribal mindset that so many of our enemies come from. islam developed from tribal cultures, and many tribal cultures over the past 1,400 years developed under islam. the islamic world itself is divided into what i would describe as tribes; you have the sunni tribe, the shia tribe, and within that are thousands of other tribes, one of the most recent being the “palestinian” tribe which has become somewhat of a self-appointed identity by various lost members of other tribes. but in afghanistan, tribalism is at a level that is virtually unparalleled in the world.

it is human nature to coalesce together into groups, but when you add islam to the mix, it fuels different dynamics that are completely alien to westerners. the tribal mindset is so vastly different than our own that it often makes it impossible to reason with them, and they will not respond logically or rationally as you might assume an american or other westerner would. to westerners, the tribal mindset may contain many elements that are quite shocking and deeply disturbing.

part of our training upon arrival in afghanistan included multiple briefings on islamic and afghan culture, since we would be working with locals on a daily basis. in one such briefing, the afghan-american man leading the discussion began by stating; “you must understand that everything about your way of life in america, is completely different in this planet.” he quickly corrected himself to say “in this country,” but his misspeaking was not too far from the truth. from the way people say hello to the way they go to the bathroom, everything is different, and it is like another world to a westerner.

in pashtun tribal law, the largest tribe in afghanistan comprising almost half the nation, there is something known as khun, or blood money. it can be paid to make amends for various transgressions such as murder, property damage, theft, kidnapping, etcetera. in addition to khun, women can be given to become sex slaves as well as female babies to eventually turn into sex slaves. women and female babies count as two-thirds of the khun.

just as in every other part of the islamic world, pashtun women have far less status than men. to divorce a woman, the man only needs to declare “i divorce thee” three times publicly. many pashtuns also believe that women have something called the “evil eye,” that they have special powers and the ability to cause bad things to happen.

in pashtun tribal law, if a woman is kidnapped by force, and coerced to consent to marry her kidnapper, but she does not get her father’s permission, the father has the right to kill her. any inclination of a woman having dishonored the family is rapidly met by her murder. in one of the detainee interrogations, i was truly shocked and saddened when the detainee was describing his family, and nonchalantly said “i have eight children, i had nine but one of my daughters dishonored the family and so i killed her,” a story i unfortunately would hear similar versions of on more than one occasion from multiple detainees.
with women and children relegated to 2nd-class status via islamic sharia, it's no wonder things are as horrific there as they still are. that the government of dubya did nothing to prevent many of these repulsive cases behind the scenes is another reason afghanistan's "liberation" was doomed to failure. we must hope donald trump's incoming government will do whatever possible in the meantime to reverse what biden's bunch enabled upon retreat. but it's doubtless going to be a very long, grueling trip to put an end to the suffering there.

trump sends a stern warning to hamas to release all hostages by the time he resumes his role as potus





donald trump sent a stern warning to the hamas demanding the release of all the israeli hostages they took on october 7, 2023:
in the waning days of the biden administration, president-elect trump is bucking his predecessor's "don't" doctrine as a deterrent to foreign adversaries, instead issuing tough warnings before even taking office.

"if the hostages are not released prior to january 20, 2025, the date that i proudly assume office as president of the united states, there will be all hell to pay in the middle east, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against humanity," trump warned hamas on his truth social account monday.

"everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire world, in the middle east – but it’s all talk, and no action!" trump added.
benjamin netanyahu also praised trump's approach:
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu thanked u.s. president-elect donald trump on tuesday for the latter’s “strong statement” calling on hamas to release the 101 hostages it has held in gaza for 424 days.

“it is a forceful statement, which makes it clear that there is only one responsible for this situation, and that is hamas,” the israeli premier said.

netanyahu addressed the president-elect’s remarks ahead of an israeli government meeting in nahariya, a northern city that has often been the target of cross-border attacks by iranian-backed hezbollah in lebanon over the past 14 months.

“hamas needs to release the hostages,” netanyahu said. “president trump put the emphasis in the correct place, on hamas, and not on the israeli government, as is customary in some places.”
trump has done an important service, exactly what joe biden failed to do, and serious action will need to be taken against hamas even after trump reenters office again. serious action will also need to be taken against hezbollah as well, since they still remain a serious threat.

rabbi murdered in uae





a missionary rabbi was sadly found murdered in the uae:
an israeli man who went missing in the united arab emirates has been found murdered, prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s office said on sunday, denouncing his death as a “heinous antisemitic terrorist act.”

zvi kogan, a rabbi who worked in the gulf arab country for an orthodox jewish group called chabad, vanished in dubai on thursday.

“the state of israel will use all means at its disposal to bring the criminals responsible for his death to justice,” the prime minister’s statement said.
the authorities of the uae did trace and arrest some suspects, and this is what's revealed about them:
it is believed that kogan was attacked by three uzbeks, who are suspected of having been hired by iran. the three allegedly followed kogan from his workplace, the kosher supermarket in abu dhabi, and then escaped to turkey. kogan's vehicle was found an hour and a half's distance from dubai.
what that demonstrates is how islamofascists can hire other islamofascists from all sorts of places to do each other's dirty work. and now it's cost a defenseless man his life. condolences to the rabbi's family.

jewish lesbian shunned by california lgbt movement because she supported trump in defense of israel





over in the usa, a jewish lesbian's learning what local lgbt movements really think of anybody who dares step off their plantation (via breitbart):
a member of the lgbtq community in los angeles says her friends are pushing her away after she voted for donald trump.

"i definitely feel like i’m on an island alone," said tanya tsikanovsky, who resides in la's san fernando valley. "the queer people have turned their backs on me, and i’m queer, so it’s very painful."

according to tsikanovsky, she worked in iowa with the hillary clinton election campaign in 2016. then, she voted for joe biden in 2020.

"i was absolutely that person who would say if you’re a trump supporter, i don’t want you in my life," said tsikanovsky. "i can say i regret that."

beyond economic reasons and the united states’ southern border, tsikanovsky says she shifted towards trump because of her jewish faith. according to tsikanovsky, recent pro-palestinian protests on college campuses made her think differently about the democratic party.

"israel [changed my mind]," said tsikanovsky. "i am a jew, and what was happening on campuses was appalling. they should have sent in the national guard as soon as jewish students were being blocked on campuses."

soon after that, tsikanovsky started sharing her new support for trump on instagram.

"i had like 50 unfollows right away," said tsikanovsky.

finally, after voting republican in the election, tsikanovsky says longtime friends and members of her lgbtq basketball team started boxing her out.

"ever since i publicly said i was voting for trump, i am no longer welcome in the [lgbtq] social spheres they provide," said tsikanovsky. "if there was a birthday party i was invited to, i’m no longer able to attend. i think it’s disgusting someone can push me out of something [like this]. they liked me 2 weeks ago, and now they don’t, just because i voted for someone."
it definitely demonstrates how, more than just ignorance, some lgbt practitioners may not really be doing so because they believe in their ideology, but rather, to undermine civilized society, in the west and elsewhere, and when it comes to islam, they're okay with its opposition to lgbt, with the worst part being that it might what to do with its being perverse and barbaric, not unlike their own practices involving transsexuality. something jewish lesbians should consider is that much of the lgbt movement's antisemitic/misogynistic, something the pc crowd would rather they not know, and being a leftist will not protect them from either bigotry. on top of all that, california's currently one of the worst places you could be in the usa.

donald trump makes historic comeback, reelected to 2nd presidential term





it's simply amazing. donald trump, who'd been robbed of his victory for a 2nd term 4 years earlier, has now made a historic comeback in another election this year, one where he also won my native pennsylvania's vote. and here's some more on this amazing milestone in history:
the fox news decision desk projects former president trump has defeated vice president kamala harris in a stunning victory, delivering him a second term in the white house after a historic election cycle filled with unprecedented twists and turns and two attempts on his life.

trump defeated vice president harris, who entered this race just over 100 days ago after president biden, who won the democratic primaries, was convinced to stand down.

trump was projected to have breached the 270 electoral vote threshold after stunning wins in the battleground states of north carolina, wisconsin, pennsylvania and georgia.
in trump's victory speech, he spoke about how his life was spared for a reason. and he's very lucky to have made it past all the terrible attempts by the left to destroy his comeback chances. he'll no doubt continue to face serious challenges. that's why he'll need the support of everybody who voted for him for the platform of improving living conditions going forward. for now, we must wish him luck in working on cleaning up the mess the left has made all these 4 years.

update: benjamin netanyahu was the first israeli politician to congratulate trump on his comeback victory.

andrew tate sides with hamas





muslim convert andrew tate continues to prove why he's a dangerous influence (via jihad watch):
controversial social media personality andrew tate posted on x/twitter on saturday that he was praying to die a death like former hamas leader yahya sinwar.

"i can only pray for a death as heroic as yahya sinwar," tate wrote. "brave, defiant in the face of evil and dedicated to his lifes purpose. he deserves eternal rest. he earnt it."

[...] who is andrew tate?

a self-described misogynist, social media influencer tate has gained millions of fans by promoting an ultra-masculine lifestyle that critics say denigrates women, according to reuters.
when somebody openly describes himself as a misogynist, it's clear the issue is not feminism, leftist or otherwise, and that, much like he's antisemitic, tate also hates women as human beings. as for reuters, it sure is odd they seemingly care, considering they've written reports before that are both hostile to israel, and unhelpful to women. and "masculine"? for heaven's sake, he is anything but "masculine" if that's how he's going act. all he's done is prove he's not a gentleman and doesn't respect women's dignity and honor.

tate sure has proven himself one of the worst influences and examples of the 21st century.

hamas overlord eliminated





finally, the barbaric yahya sinwar, the overlord of the hamas terrorist organization, has been obliterated by the idf:
the israel defense forces confirmed on thursday that hamas leader and oct. 7 architect yahya sinwar was killed in an airstrike in southern gaza after more than a year of eluding israeli forces.

“eliminated: yahya sinwar,” the military announced on x.

the jewish state’s foreign affairs minister israel katz called it a “victory for the entire free world.”

“mass murderer yahya sinwar, who was responsible for the massacre and atrocities of october 7, was killed today by idf soldiers,” katz said in a written statement from his office.

“this is a great military and moral achievement for israel and a victory for the entire free world against the axis of evil of radical islam led by iran.”

reports had begun circulating earlier in the day that a terrorist matching the hamas chief’s description was killed in a military operation near rafah.

while intelligence officials believed that sinwar would be surrounded by hostages to use as human shields, the idf confirmed that no hostages were injured in the strike that took sinwar out.

israeli media reported that the operation was a routine raid that caught sinwar by chance.

israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his cabinet members had sworn to hunt down and kill sinwar after learning that he was the man behind the oct. 7 massacre that killed more than 1,200 people in israel and saw another 251 kidnapped.
the hamas troglodyte's body was identified by dental records:
idf forces discovered large amounts of israeli cash and identifying documents on the terrorists' bodies. due to the presence of explosives and grenades, drones were initially used to examine the bodies.

one of the terrorists bore a strong resemblance to hamas leader yahya sinwar, leading troops to believe they may have killed him unintentionally, without prior intelligence. the exact location of the raid remains undisclosed for security reasons.

to confirm sinwar’s identity, soldiers photographed the body and sent the images to the israeli police’s forensic unit. assistant commissioner aliza raziel, head of the unit, confirmed that the teeth in the photos matched sinwar's dental records from his time in israeli custody.

"we had sinwar’s dental data on file, and the match was clear," raziel said. "this was one of the most significant moments this year, allowing us to quickly provide critical information to the field."

further evidence suggesting sinwar’s death included the presence of a senior hamas commander known to frequently accompany him. reports from gaza indicated the other two terrorists killed were sinwar’s bodyguards, one of whom worked as a teacher for unrwa and the other a high-ranking official in hamas’ national security office.
so another un employee who also worked for terrorists simultaneously was punished. it's a vital victory indeed. now, the question remaining is, where are any hostages who're hopefully still alive?

update: joel pollak notes:
israel confirmed thursday that its soldiers had killed hamas leader yahya sinwar during a battle the day before in gaza. that would have been impossible if president joe biden and vice president kamala harris had their way.
good point.

hezbollah overlord obliterated





the idf just scored a most vital victory in the war against hezbollah in lebanon, eliminating hassan nasrallah, the overlord of the terrorist organization:
on friday afternoon, shortly before shabbat, the idf conducted a precise strike, eliminating hezbollah's leader, hassan nasrallah, idf chief of staff herzi halevi confirmed.

the strike took place in hezbollah’s underground headquarters in the heart of beirut, along with other senior officials in the terrorist organization.

halevi stressed, "nasrallah indiscriminately murdered israeli civilians and aimed to end this war with the destruction of the state of israel. we made sure that did not occur. we eliminated him, and we will continue to grow stronger."

he added, "hezbollah has murdered innocent people worldwide, hiding his weapons under the homes of families, women and children and turning them into human shields."

"as we have shown, we will not allow such a threat to our citizens! we are determined to continue destroying the hezbollah terrorist organization and to keep fighting. we have more missions ahead on all fronts—destroying terrorist organizations and their capabilities, returning our hostages—the mission is constantly before our eyes! as well as the safe return of the residents in the north and south to their homes.

"this week, the year comes to an end—a year where idf commanders and soldiers fight bravely and work to put an end to the hardships of the past. the idf stands with the bereaved families. we will continue to honor the path of the fallen.

"with the fighting spirit and resilience of the entire nation, the idf will continue to safeguard our security!”
one of the idf's spokesmen told cnn it's disturbing how the usa government under joe biden/kamala harris called for ceasefires when israel began taking defensive action:
on saturday’s “cnn this morning,” idf spokesman maj. doron spielman responded to frustration from the white house with israel over ceasefires by stating that “for an entire year, hezbollah has been firing rockets, over 9,000 rockets, missiles, and killer drones and no one talked about a ceasefire. now that israel’s actually taking the assertion to try to protect its civilians, we’re calling for a ceasefire.” and stated that “the world, instead of demanding [that israel have] a ceasefire, should be demanding that hezbollah pull out.” [...]

spielman answered, “i can tell you, jim, that the last year has been the greatest challenge in israel’s history. we are threatened by seven different fronts, the houthis in yemen, hezbollah in the north, hamas in gaza, and that’s just to name a few. this is the hour that israel will look back and the world will look back and say, who stands by israel in this hour? and the u.s., i’m not a politician, i’m here on behalf of the army, has been the greatest friend and has supported israel and understands our objectives. regarding a ceasefire, for an entire year, hezbollah has been firing rockets, over 9,000 rockets, missiles, and killer drones and no one talked about a ceasefire. now that israel’s actually taking the assertion to try to protect its civilians, we’re calling for a ceasefire. as we’ve said, and as the israeli army says, we’re open for anything as long as israeli civilians can go back to their home[s] and hezbollah withdraws behind the litani. what we know is that, right now, hezbollah, every one of those rockets and missiles is inside one of their own homes, they’re civilian homes. you’ve seen the pictures. they don’t care about lebanese civilians. they don’t care about israeli civilians. and the world, instead of demanding [that israel have] a ceasefire, should be demanding that hezbollah pull out.”
it's truly reprehensible that anybody would call for an ambiguous "ceasefire", when it's only meant to undermine efforts to defeat the evil entity that even ronald reagan and george bush sr. have to shoulder blame for allowing to take over lebanon, all at the expense of christians and other innocent and defenseless inhabitants of the area. i'm not letting them off the hook any more than say, jimmy carter, whose own damage when it comes to iran cannot be overlooked either.

benjamin netanyahu approved the strike against hezbollah from a usa hotel room:
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu approved friday’s airstrike on hezbollah’s headquarters in beirut, lebanon, from his hotel room in new york city prior to his speech to the united nations general assembly.

the prime minister’s office released a photograph that it said showed netanyahu approving the massive airstrike.

the massive attack targeted hezbollah’s underground headquarters in the dahiyeh neighborhood of beirut.

netanyahu apparently delivered his address knowing that the attack was under way. he cut short a press conference after the speech when a military aide whispered in his ear.
the un is a disgrace, as he also pointed out. it's long overdue to get rid of hezbollah as much as hamas, and the plo must also go. mahmoud abbas is one of the worst bigots around, and he alone makes clear what's wrong with them as well.
