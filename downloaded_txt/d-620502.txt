construction is happy to announce that we are the construction manager for the $40 million expansion and renovation at fishers elementary school. the site holds significant historical value as home to the original fishers high school, built over 80 years ago. the renovation will double the school’s capacity and revitalize the community while honoring its legacy within hamilton county education. this multi-phased project has begun with the construction of two stories of new classrooms, on a site with limited access for construction, students, and staff. the logistics of the site only allow two paths into the school campus. wurster construction has phased the project in such a way that segregates construction from the school’s daily operations. following the completion of the new classrooms we will begin the expansion and renovation of the cafeteria, kitchen, and gymnasium. the final phase of the project will be to demolish the existing building’s classrooms and dramatically increase the parking capacity along lantern rd. < >johnson memorial hospital mental health facilitywurster construction is proud to announce its partnership with cripe architects and the johnson
