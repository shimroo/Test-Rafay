maa president's message


january/february message
dear maa members,
i am truly honored to take on the role of president of the michigan assessors association for 2025, and i’m excited to embark on this journey with all of you. as i step into this position, my main focus will be on enhancing the value of our membership while fostering stronger networking and collaboration. i believe we have a unique opportunity to not only strengthen the connections within our professional community but also to bring in new voices, perspectives, and talents that will help propel us into the future. at the heart of this, i am committed to ensuring that the relationships we build together are at the core of our association’s success.
one of my top priorities as president is to make sure every member feels engaged, heard, and supported. this will involve reevaluating how we connect, communicate, and share resources within the association. whether you’ve been with us for years or are a new member, i want you to feel that your voice matters, your needs are addressed, and your contributions are valued. i am dedicated to providing opportunities for professional development, continuing education, and access to industry events that can help us all succeed in our careers.
networking will be a key focus of my leadership, but i view networking as more than just a tool for career advancement. it’s about creating genuine relationships that provide both personal and professional growth. i want to ensure we’re building spaces where members can connect on a deeper level and work together in meaningful ways. i also see a strong opportunity to engage more with our affiliate organizations, as these partnerships often lead to some of the most impactful collaborations. i want our association to be a place where camaraderie and mutual support thrive. finally, i want to encourage all of you to actively contribute to the growth and direction of our association. your feedback, ideas, and participation will be crucial as we continue to expand our membership and strengthen our networking efforts. i look forward to working with such a talented and passionate group of individuals. together, we can continue to build an association that not only serves as a professional resource but also as a vibrant, supportive community where each of us can thrive.
i’ll leave you with one of my favorite quotes: “sit with the winners, the conversation is different.” this speaks to how the people we surround ourselves with can inspire us to elevate our standards and reach greater heights. i look forward to sitting with all of you at that table.
sincerely,
elizabeth tobias, president
