michelle t.google review 






						"i like to say is, the people at this place is very helpful. i look every where for this one item and it is very hard to find. even amazon didn't even have it and ebay well that's another story to tell later! the people at j&t auto parts thought they had it and they didn't but they made a phone call in south carolina at a parts store that they know and wow they had one in stock. they even ship the part to j&t auto parts. that is what i call going out of your way and helping someone in need. i thank you j&t auto parts for that and god bless you!!!"
