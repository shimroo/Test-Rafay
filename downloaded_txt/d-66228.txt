about burning flipside
burning flipside is a texas regional art and music festival inspired by burning man. it is a place for radical self expression and an experiment in temporary community building. it is a place of acceptance, inclusiveness, and respect. it is organized entirely by volunteers. the art and entertainment is created solely by participants. there are no spectators. there are no concession stands. no cash transactions are permitted at flipside. even bartering is discouraged. this is a sincere experiment in creating a gift economy. if you need something, ask for it. if you have it, gift it! this is a leave no trace event. there are no garbage cans. participants pack out their garbage. personal responsibility is key. it is a private event created entirely by volunteers.
