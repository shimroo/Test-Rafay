about acc


arapahoe community college, founded in 1965 as arapahoe junior college, was the first 2-year college in the greater denver metro area. the college grew out of a grassroots effort by littleton residents who wanted to provide post-high school education in the area. in addition to the littleton campus, acc provides programs at the sturm collaboration campus at castle rock, a partnership with douglas county school district and csu.
