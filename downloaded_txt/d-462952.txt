did you decide on a topic for the math fair?  post your topic here.  be specific.  for example, don't just say proportions.  what do you want to do/prove with proportions.  you could build a scale model of is93 using proportions, or plan a road trip across the us or around the world using proportions, or other things.if you're not sure exactly what you want to do, tell us your comment and ask for help.  your classmates can make suggestions.don't forget to put your name in your comment.
