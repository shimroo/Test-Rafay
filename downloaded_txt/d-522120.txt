our practice areas – family lawyers in dallas, tx


at mueller family law group , our family lawyers have experience
	 handling various legal disputes, including:


divorce. the emotional and legal aspects of dissolving a marriage can make filing
		 for a divorce daunting. our lawyers have experience handling high-profile
		 cases and can work with you to ensure you identify and take the best path
		 forward in your divorce. from property division to child custody and beyond,
		 our family law attorneys in dallas will usher you through the divorce
		 process with a personalized, empathetic approach that realizes and meets
		 your unique needs. our lawyers can also help you use various forms of
		 alternative dispute resolution (adr), such as mediation and collaborative
		 law, to negotiate a more amicable resolution with your soon-to-be-ex.
	

property division. property division is often one of the most hotly contested aspects of
		 any divorce, particularly when significant assets such as a business or
		 real estate is at stake. you can trust our lawyers to defend your rights
		 and property throughout your divorce.
	

child custody and
			support. we know that, as a parent, you want the best for your children. so do
		 we. our attorneys are committed to advocating for your parental rights
		 in and out of court, helping you obtain an equitable timeshare or support
		 arrangement for your child. we'll work tirelessly to ensure your child
		 has the resources established to thrive post-divorce or paternity case.
	

alimony. whether you're a prospective payor or recipient in an alimony case, our
		 family law lawyers in dallas can help you achieve your goals. we know
		 just how important achieving a fair alimony arrangement is and will work
		 with you to help ensure you remain financially stable post-divorce.
	

appeals and
			modifications. if you believe a court mishandled your case or the circumstances surrounding
		 a legal order have changed substantially since it was issued, our attorneys
		 will help you file for an appeal or modification. we'll collaborate with
		 you to ensure your judgment accurately reflects your situation and is
		 fair to both parties.
	




enforcements. if a party you're engaged in a legal order with fails to hold up their
		 end of the arrangement, we can help. our lawyers will take the necessary
		 steps to ensure a court upholds the terms of a legal arrangement and you
		 receive the support you deserve.
	

child relocation. parents often want to relocate to help their child(ren) thrive, but doing
		 so means getting another parent or the court's approval. trust our dallas
		 family lawyers to represent you and establish why relocating suits your
		 child's best interests.
	

prenuptial and postnuptial agreements. a pre or postnuptial agreement can strengthen your bond with your partner
		 and help ensure your marriage remains equitable. we'll help you draft
		 a comprehensive pre or postnup that suits you and your partner's needs.
	

private adoptions. many parents who wish to welcome a new family member into their lives
		 do so through private adoption. our dallas family law attorneys can help
		 streamline the process, so you welcome your new family members as quickly
		 and easily as possible.
	

father's,
			mother's and
			grandparent's rights. frequently, individuals with a familial connection to an individual engaged
		 in a court case question how that connection may affect their legal dispute.
		 we can help you find out and work towards a positive outcome.
	

protective and restraining orders. if you're engaged in a domestic violence dispute, a protective or restraining
		 order can help you stay safe up to and after receiving a judgment from
		 the court. our attorneys will fiercely represent you, handling the legal
		 burden of your case so you can focus on your health and wellbeing.

	 boutique services while simultaneously accessing a vast network of helpful
	 resources. the result is a streamlined, client-focused approach to family

more testimonials











they are some of the most zealous advocates i've ever seen, but careful and methodical.
“after struggling with two other family law attorneys for 4 years, we switched over to mueller family law, who was able to accomplish much more for our family than any prior attorney.”
- r.s.




i have had the best experience here and will always highly recommend them to my friends and family.
“mueller family law is truly the best of the best. jim mueller and his team are top-notch. you cannot beat them as far as responsiveness, professionalism, and knowledge of the law. i have had the best ...”
- d.d.




i can’t imagine having gone through this process without you.
“you have been my counselor, therapist, mentor, advisor – and most of all- my friend. i can’t imagine having gone through this process without you.”
- j.m.




they have become friends of the family and are very kind and conscientious of the emotional state that the client is going through at the time.
“jim mueller, and greg beane took on an insurmountable task. they were excellent at keeping us informed, they took on the colorado court system with a child custody suit.”
- r.m.




the firm recommended we try for a collaborative divorce, and we did so successfully in about 90 days.
“i used janet brumley at a most difficult time in my life, the end of a 15-year marriage with 4 children. the firm recommended we try for a collaborative divorce, and we did so successfully in about 90 days. obviously, a collaborative divorce requires both”
- a.s.
