a new cosmology that weaves together the physicaluniverse and the spiritual realm into one fabric


as well as this synthesis, stationary energy theory unifies electro-magnetic and nuclear forces with gravitation using simple math. it has all energy, including the spiritual energy blueprint for the universe, stationary in space and time, and all matter moving at the speed of light through time and space as the universe expands, giving rise to the flow of time and scanning the cosmic blueprint as it goes. this theory's equation for gravity, fg =  ½mc²(α  σ)/d where

α and σ

are space-curvature angles, is used to accurately calculate the acceleration of the expansion of the universe without the need for 'dark energy.' to find out more, click here.

the hot springs of america - a novel about our desperate times!


the worst of religious-right dystopias could be just around the corner in america. since our separation of church and state is so fragile, and our politics so polarized, a medieval-style christian theocracy could take power after a terrorist attack and propel the usa into another civil war. this is the stage this novel is built on. hot springs of america is in the tradition of the handmaid's tale, but more recently written and so more in tune with the alarming reality our country is facing. the story embodies the challenge that could come our way and shows how a dedicated resistance could overcome it and bring about the truly egalitarian society america has been waiting for. read more about the book, and the first four chapters for free, by cliking here: hot springs of america

endorsements and reviews:

in search of the loving god is a book written with a purpose - and that purpose is to bring an age old message of truth and love to our tired, confused and desperate world. mark is out to conquer hearts and win love for god. his book mingles impressive scholarship with both poetic appeal and down to earth empirical experiences. the world is in great need of the healing that this book could bring it.

     (ian d. baynes, b.v.sc., m.a.p.s.)

in search of the loving god reads like a combination mystery, history, and bible commentary all rolled into one. read it for its enlightening view on scripture and revealing stories of the church's history. may the spirit use this book to reach many people with its hopeful
message for the future of christianity.

     (joy wells, educator)


mr mason's skills as both researcher and writer are such that i was unable to put the book down once i started it. he makes what could be a very dry topic not only readable, but also highly relevant to someone who is attempting to move beyond surface spirituality to a level of deep understanding and growth.
     
his book is divided into two parts. the first gives a very comprehensive, and eye-opening, history of the bible and christianity as a religion. he shows incredibly clearly how and why the church strayed from the teachings of jesus and what that means to the church today. the second section shows how the bible and its teachings are relevant to seekers in today's world. he describes bible passages that teach us about reincarnation, a simple lifestyle and free will, and he includes wonderful and affirming interpretations about what hell and the book of revelation really means.

     (patricia vallerand, from her review of in search of the loving god in the observer quarterly)

author's description of in search of the loving god:

in search of the loving god proposes that the key to knowing and loving god is meditation, but that before we can love god, and effectively meditate, we need to overcome our fear of him. the book challenges traditional christian beliefs by taking a fresh look at the life of jesus, and at how the church soon became corrupt and power-seeking and largely ignored jesus' teachings, invented the concept of everlasting punishment in hell in order to control people through fear, and eventually terrorized european society with the inquisition and the witch craze, in which millions of women were burned at the stake, often for no crime greater than being a midwife. it looks at the disturbing similarities between medieval christianity and modern religious fundamentalism, which in america manifests as the christian coalition, and other organizations of the religious right. it shows how the "us and them" nature of our society is based on, and underpinned by, the medieval christian belief that some people are valuable to god and are saved, while others are not and are eternally damned. the importance of the separation of church and state in protecting us against fundamentalism, and preserving our freedom to make our own moral choices is highlighted, as is the reality of our free will -- god's greatest gift to us.

the book has chapters on why there is no honest biblical basis for believing in everlasting punishment in hell, biblical evidence for believing in reincarnation, a metaphysical interpretation of the book of revelation, how to meditate, the reality of miracles in our lives, and on how christianity could be more accepting of other religions such as judaism, hinduism, buddhism and islam. it advocates a radical reform of christianity, which would result in it becoming a religion of love and acceptance, rather than what it traditionally has been: a religion of guilt and fear. abandoning the belief in eternal hell, and embracing reincarnation and meditation may sound particularly new age, but the bible shows jesus taught these concepts, and that they open the way to knowing and loving god. if you are looking for a loving and inclusive spirituality, a christianity that embraces god and all people, then this book might be a stepping stone on your path.

in divine love,

mark mason
