daisy john

“dear hilda, carol and the servants of god, thank you for showing us the meaning of serving.  you guys were such a true example of christ's servants.  your manners, cheerfulness, fruit of the spirit was just flowing within and in your life... your love for the lord humbled me.  such a blessing...the presence of god is so full in this place.  may god bless your endeavor and your giving.”







cross bend christian church

"i have been to good camps, and i have been to great camps.  now i have been to a godly camp.  may god bless you and your staff for a memorable time of worship."

“stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls."
