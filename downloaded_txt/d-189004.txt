guest reviews


"the best!"
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
               i want to say from the moment we got here the staff has tried to be very accommodating. alexis went out of her way to make sure our stay was wonderful. we have stayed many tines and have loved every minute. last night we had a noise issue with a neighbor and we called to ask them to tone it down a bit. we get it’s vacation time. the security officer was so kind and helpful trying to figure which unit the noise was coming from. they found it and the people did tone it down the young man at the pool early we have seen many years. always polite and helpful. that is the kind of treatment you get when you stay here. we look forward to the rest of our stay. star island is number 1 in our book. be well everyone and happy vacationing.
