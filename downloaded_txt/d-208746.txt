scheduled online & delivered by zoom or phonechoice of several levels of corporate supportessential in times of stressthe company chaplain is providing a new kind of support for employees–spiritual care, delivered by highly trained clinicians–for the difficulties that we all face at times, when we need expert, confidential, caring wisdom and support, but not mental health care. employees often fear the stigma associated with seeking help from a mental health provider, or receiving a mental health diagnosis. they often feel they should not be showing vulnerability by seeking help. correctly or not, employees want to send the message that they are putting the company first, showing up even when under the weather. now employers can augment their existing employee assistance programs with professional spiritual care, so there is a stigma-free option for team members to choose, when life and work stress, or a crisis of meaning and purpose–not mental illness–is the issue. the company chaplain is a natural partner for mental health care providers–we are clinically trained, interdisciplinary care providers–to round out your employee care benefits! please note: we do not provide mental health care. if you are experiencing a life-threatening situation, please call 911 or immediately go to an emergency room.compassionate care and supporta time tested organizational interventionsome of the world’s largest organizations use chaplains to support their troops. literally, the army sends soldiers into battle with chaplains at their side. and they’ve been doing it for centuries, proving that spiritual care and support is essential in times of great employee stress. the company chaplain™ gives you access to the same type of care for your team.during this time of covid, frontline workers have experienced the type of constant danger that previously only the military would expect to see on the battlefield. others have struggled with uncertainty and loss. doesn’t your team deserve spiritual care and support, too?a military company has anywhere from a few dozen to 200 soldiers. whatever the size of your company, join the company chaplain at the membership level that works for you – and give your most important asset a convenient, stigma-free choice for wellness.your workers are on the battlefield for you, they are key to the success of your business, and your membership in the company chaplain can help them through difficult times.  click here to learn more about company chaplain membership discounts and benefits.for employeesemployersfor employeesemployees: these are difficult times, but when you have a problem it’s not always obvious who to talk to—your boss, your friend, or your family? sometimes we want a neutral party to just listen… someone who doesn’t know us and our friends or family. that is why the company chaplain™ is here for you.some common issues addressed by the company chaplain:worries, fear and uncertaintygrief and bereavementisolation, lonelinessdiscouragement and sadnessrelationship issuesan empathic listener, interested in what’s most important to youa company chaplain is a great listener, interested in you as a whole being, making us a holistic alternative to psychological counseling. our focus is your emotional and spiritual well-being. that’s why we will ask you about what’s important to you in terms of giving you strength and purpose in life.in other words, we’ll support you in the life-supporting values and interests that are meaningful to you. we are all spiritual beings at the company chaplain, drawing nourishment from our diverse faiths and spiritual practices.we don’t evangelize or proselytize, meaning we never try to convert others. that’s a prime directive for our professional chaplains. a company chaplain is a clinically-trained, highly educated and empathic counselor who is board certified. that means that their education and training has been reviewed by an independent, national professional body which has found that they meet the highest standards of ethics and professionalism.getting acquainted — what you can expect from a company chaplainmany people are unfamiliar with chaplains. most have a vague sense that they are associated with a church or religion, and it’s true that you will find people called chaplains doing great work in some churches. those folks are not clinically trained, however, and rarely if ever have the advanced education and professional training of a board-certified chaplain—the only type of chaplain you’ll find at the company chaplain™.our diverse faiths give us strength and purpose at the company chaplain, and help us to serve others. so belief and spirituality are very important to us, but we adhere to the highest professional standards and will never try to convince others to think or act as we do—unless someone directly asks us to share our beliefs or values.what’s vital to you might be faith, family and friends, or life goals—or a combination of them. it’s different for different people, of course, but once we know the “secret sauce” that gives you strength, we will work with you to draw out the flavors of those important ingredients. even if they are not overtly, “spiritual or religious.” out of those essential elements, we’ll craft a response to your current difficulties — a recipe to help you heal, thrive and move on to where you want to be in your life.military-grade confidentiality™company chaplain services are highly confidential. like our professional colleagues in the military, a company chaplain™ preserves the bond of trust with those whom we serve by not making a report on what you share with us.that means we don’t report on what you share with us to your employer and don’t make any entries in a medical record. we call that military-grade confidentiality™.we are not mental health providers, so we are not going to make a mental health diagnosis or analysis as we talk to you. we are going to listen, provide empathy, help you clarify the roots of your concerns or suffering. we’re going to help you identify some of your strengths and help you reconnect with them, and draw on them to start to heal.accessing servicesanyone can access the company chaplain. just click schedule a session, choose the kind of support you want and follow the prompts to get
