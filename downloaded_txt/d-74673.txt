did you know?





we run on mods. 
in place of a traditional semester or trimester model, the csw calendar year is divided into six, six-week modules in a framework we know as the mod system. during each mod, students take three blocks of academic classes that meet every day, usually for  90 minutes. this setup allows for breadth, depth, and curricular agency you won't find at any other school.




social justice isn't a trend — it's a lifesyle.
our thoughtfully designed social justice courses examine historical and contemporary issues from the perspectives of non-western cultures and/or historically oppressed groups; disseminate structures of power and privilege — their history, causes, and effects; and study models of social change, with the goal of advancing human rights and equity.




no two schedules are alike.
in addition to off-campus learning opportunities, students can select from over 250 courses per year across a wide variety of subject-areas and pursuits. no two student schedules are alike.




we live sustainably.
csw's garthwaite center for science and art was constructed of materials and systems that reflect an emphasis on sustainability, including composting toilets, a wood pellet boiler, passive solar collection system, and non-toxic materials and finishings.




student voice matters here.
csw is proud to be one of two independent schools in the nation to have students serve on its board of trustees with full voting privileges. one boarding and one day student are elected by the student body to serve one-year terms as full voting members, representing student views to the board.




we set the pace
every other wednesday, in lieu of the core academic classes, csw students participate in pace: promoting awareness and community engagement, a four-year co-curriculum designed so that all csw students develop self-awareness, social consciousness, healthy living habits, and leadership skills required to meet the demands of an increasingly complex and diverse world.
