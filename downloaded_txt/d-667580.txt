excitement is building for the 2024 state games of america presented by national university, and a common question we've received is: can anyone compete? in short, no. the long answer is that you must qualify. fortunately, there are various ways to qualify, depending on whether you are a california resident or non-california resident for this biennial event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     california resident                                                                                                                        since the 2024 state games of america (sga) are hosted in san diego by the california state games, all california residents can register for the sga just like they would for a normal california state games. due to the ncsg neighboring state policy, athletes in nevada (which does not have its own state member organization) also qualify for the 2024 state games of america.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     non-california resident                                                                                                                        if you’re an athlete coming from one of the other 30+ national congress of state games (ncsg) member state programs, qualification is more extensive. here’s how you may have qualified depending on the year you competed in an ncsg member state program:                                                                                                            2022: all gold, silver, and bronze medalists qualify from ncsg member state programs, both winter and summer. any medalist from the 2022 sga held in ames, iowa qualifies.                                                                                                            2023: all gold, silver, and bronze medalists qualify from ncsg member state programs, both winter and summer.                                                                                                            2024 (before july 1): all gold, silver, and bronze medalists qualify from ncsg member state programs, both winter and summer.                                                                                                            any medalists from the 2022 state games of america are eligible to compete in 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        sport qualification                                                                                                            lastly, review the offered sports as the final step to check for qualification. even if you meet the qualification criteria as a california or non-california resident, your sport must be offered in the 2024 state games of america to participate. each host state determines the sport lineup, so even if your sport was offered in 2019 or 2022 in your home state, it may not be offered in the 2024 state games of america. this may be influenced by regional or geographic location, facilities, sport directors, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     if you qualify to compete after reviewing the qualification, visit the                                              registration information                                               as soon as possible.
