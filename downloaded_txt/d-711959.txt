a texan abroad



“texas is a state of mind. texas is an obsession. above all, texas is a nation in every sense of the word. and there's an opening convey of generalities. a texan outside of texas is a foreigner.” - john steinbeck

a conservative texan's thoughts on equality





rhode island has become the tenth us state to grant same sex marriage equality.  texas is not among the other nine.

it may come as a shock to some who believe all texans are bible thumping, hate mongering, hypocrites but as a true conservative i am for equality.  sadly too many mouthy, judgmental, hateful, nasty 'christians' claim that god gives them the power to hate, to be cruel, to be nasty.

i was raised a southern baptist.  for those who may be a bit confused on what that is, let me give you a quick & dirty rundown.  southern baptists don't drink, don't dance, don't gamble, don't do drugs, and are fine upstanding people.  southern baptist women are meant to be quiet, pregnant, in the kitchen while the man takes the reins of everything.  well, that's what some southern baptists would like you to believe.  it is incredibly far from the truth.

my poppy was a deacon in our church.  it was years before he would take the position as he drank beer regularly.  my mimi was anything but a quiet, subservient wife in the shadows.  she was a lady about it, but she spoke her mind and stood her ground.  you might never have expected to find cold hard steel in her veins, but under than cute little rolly polly exterior beat the heart of a lioness.

my aunt sat on the board until she was run out of that church by some of the aforementioned hateful, nasty 'christians'.  she was legitimately elected to office by the members of that church and a few holier-than-thous decided to take it upon themselves to 'cleanse' the church of her.  they claimed her being gay was morally wrong and god was against it, that jesus condemned her for it.  thing is, christ never said anything about homosexuality.  period.  nada!  not one single, solitary, red word was ever attributed to him.

these same holier-than-thous put into office, without election, a gay man that then cruised the church for young men to abuse.  he was caught doing it many times but was always protected by those nasty 'christians', the vipers in the den so to speak.  don't think gay had anything to do with their hate - they used it as an excuse to punish those they wanted & reward those that kissed their asses.  that is not in keeping with the message of christ.

i was raised by true christians.  those who said it was not their place to judge, not their right to deny others the same things they took for granted.  people who would give you the shirt off their back, the sweat of their brow, the food from their plate.  people who were learned, 5 generations of teachers & counting!, educated, worldly people who stood for what was right.  there was no moral grey ground, there was right & there was wrong and there aren't enough of them left in my opinion.

as a product of these people i can not, will not stand idly by and watch my fellow texans denied the very basic right of marrying someone they love.  i'd like to take on quite a few of the most common arguments against equality - in all its forms.

marriage has long predated christianity, every abrahamaic religion is a baby compared to the concept of marriage.  marriage was not "one man, one woman".  even today islam, an abrahamaic religion at its core, is not about "one man, one woman".  mormons, not abrahamaic but still a commonly practiced religion, is not "one man, one woman".  that argument will not hold water with anyone that has even a passing understanding of human history.

marriage between consenting adults has been going on long before christianity came to this land.  hundreds of tribes held same sex marriage as sacred, blessed by the gods.  just because someone says that jesus says its wrong doesn't mean it is.  nor does the claim that no one has ever done same sex marriage here make it so. 

the government has no business deciding what consenting adults can, or can not, get married.  the government only takes money to issue a marriage license.  since the government issues the money, and issues the license, at what point does someone who is 'gay' using make it illegal?  how can a government both issue money claiming to represent the people while at the same time denying the people the ability to spend it equally as they see fit?

the equal protection clause clearly states that any marriage contracted in one state is valid in all others.  hence why my 16+ years of marriage have been valid in colorado and virginia even though i was married in texas.  what basic constitutional understanding would allow someone to believe that the equal protection clause applies only to heterosexuals?

those that claim marriage is for the production of children, since when?  in my own family i can pinpoint people who are married without children.  be it the male or female that is infertile, a conscious choice not to have children, or a medical condition preventing it their marriage is no less valid under the law.  bearing children is not and never has been the point of marriage.

the claims made that marriage can't be redefined.  i beg to differ.  two hundred years ago my father would have had to pay my husband land, crops, goods, or animals if not all the above, to marry me.  in short, i would have been sold by my father to my husband.  that is not marriage.  that is a form of slavery.  thousands of years ago i would have had to have slaves to buy my marriage.  heaps of gold, spices, pricey materials, animals, property, land, slaves ... they were all required to purchase a groom.  we don't do that any more, thus marriage has already been 're'defined.

one of the more ludicrous arguments is that if gays can marry, then homosexuality will spread.  that one is so far beyond the reach of logic, but i shall try.  guns are legal, not everyone owns one.  cars are legal, not everyone owns one. marriage is legal, not everyone marries.  the sheer lunacy of saying that two consenting adults making a commitment will somehow make people gay is just beyond me.

there are those that say a gay marriage will cheapen their heterosexual marriage.  my marriage is not under threat from gay people.  there isn't some light in his loafers man hiding in a dark alley waiting to jump my husband & make him fabulous!!!  if you're really that terrified that your marriage will end and your spouse will marry someone of the same sex, you've got much deeper issues in your life.

the most odious, to me, claims are from those quoting leviticus.  one can not claim christianity & go old testament.  christ clearly stated he came to make a new covenant, thus negating the old one.  he negated the dietary laws of leviticus - bacon y'all, we're talking the loss of bacon if we go ot.  the sheer number of supposed, self described 'christians' that flaunt every violation of leviticus while claiming homosexuality is wrong boggles my mind!  god said all sin is equal, thus eating bacon is on par with being gay if you want to actually see the bible for what it says.  polyester clothing, shellfish, bacon, they're all wrong according to leviticus.  in my world, if bacon is wrong i don't want to be right!!

i think i hit on most of the big arguments against equality, but really they all boil down to one nasty, ugly truth.  that some americans believe they're legally better than others.  that is in direct violation of our basic premiss of government.  "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  the ability to live, the liberty to purse happiness.  not dependent upon color, religion, sexuality, hair style, height, age, weight, yada yada yada.  just the basic 3 rules of our entire form of government - life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.  gardening makes me happy, doesn't mean i'm going to force you to garden!  mall shopping does not make me happy, but i'm not going to try to ban you from doing it if you enjoy it.  thus, no one who truly supports liberty, any basic student of logic, any true christian, can possibly stand against equal rights.  it is beyond odious to me that some even dare attempt to twist such basic, honest beliefs to fit their hate.

shifty powers & how we treat our real heroes





so the oft carried, always miss attributed, shifty powers letter is making the rounds again on facebook.  it got me to thinking.  sadly, darrell powers (aka shifty) passed in 2009, right before we pcsd back to the states.  i know we got coverage on afn in europe, but i doubt there was much coverage in the states - it isn't like the man was a genuine hero (at least according to the garbage they show on us tv).


i remember, late may 2002, waiting to board a plane in dallas.  we were flying out to our next duty station in england.  there was a mild kerfuffle at the x-ray & security station.  i thought nothing of it really, until i realized the hold up was an elderly gentleman & his wife.  i couldn't for the life of me figure out why he was being held up, he clearly did not pose any threat to anyone.


i was busy getting an infant, a young child, myself & the husband through security so i wasn't paying that much attention.  until i caught the emblem on his hat.  it was just a standard dark blue, military retiree style, baseball cap.  i had made a mental note to tell him "thank you" for your service when i realized it was a retiree, but that emblem.  it troubled me.  i knew it, but it was rare to see.  i honestly had to think about it for a few moments before i placed it.  that was a very rare, very seldom seen, very important emblem.







that is, for those who may not know, a congressional medal of honor ribbon.  that was the ribbon on his hat!  when it hit me what it was, i was in genuine awe.  that is not a medal often seen, and it was awarded for going well above the call of duty to his nation.  it made me that much more determined to give him a proper thanks for his service, and hopefully find out a little bit about him.


i got a moment to speak to him while we were waiting to board early.  he was accepted for early boarding, i assume, due to his age.  we got early boarded due to the kids.  i was just glad we managed to be right behind him in line so i could chat with him.


turns out he served on the european front, and was captured by the germans.  he didn't go into much, but i mentioned my great-grandfather was a pow of the japanese (he was), and was rescued from cabanatuan.  this gentleman, i never caught his name he was very polite but not at all in to talking about his exploits, made a point of saying he endured nothing compared to what the japanese did to their pows.  that, to the great granddaughter of a man who lived it, is belittling his own experiences.  the germans weren't nice to pows, they didn't obey the rules of war, they blocked the red cross just as much.  this man went hungry, was cold, was mistreated, had suffered in the name of his fellow countrymen & women to protect them from his very pain.  he was, and is, an hero.  he came when called, he offered his life blood to his nation to protect & defend those he loved.  that is no small feat.  this man, who had fought for his country while a young man, didn't think himself worthy of what my great-grandfather went through.  it nearly broke my heart for him to think he didn't really do anything worthy of the praise he received.


he went on to mention that he didn't endure nearly what those that didn't come home did.  the mark of a truly humble, honest, quiet servant of his nation & people.  he discounted his own trauma, his own suffering, as not up to that which others endured.  i had no real response to that, other than he served his nation where & when he was needed and he shouldn't think that his experiences weren't important.


i happened to ask what the hold up was at the security line.  i was being nosy, i admit it.  it turns out he was flying with the medal in his carry-on bag.  yes, that medal.  the highest honor his nation's military could bestow on him (or anyone for that matter) for his military service.  he offered to get it out & show it to me, but he was already being much more than polite by having a chat with me so i didn't put him out in any way.  yes i'd have loved to see it, but then i'd have wanted to touch it and well, that's just rude!


the reason the medal was in his carry on?  i shouldn't have to explain that one.  the fact that it was is what had caused the kerfuffle.  apparently security made him put it through the x-ray machine!  then demanded he open it as it was metal & it seems they though it was a "threat" to security.  not a "thank you sir, for your service". not an awed silence at seeing one, and the man who earned it.  just total ignorance of what it was, and why he had it.  that, well even now i admit flabbergasts me!  how far the us has fallen that a real, genuine, cmoh award recipient & his cmoh were unknown, and instead viewed as a security threat!


this quiet, unassuming man who should have had parades in his honor, was a "threat" as deemed by the security folks at dallas/fort worth international airport.  as a texan, i was doubly humiliated and offended that this man was ill treated.  he bore it with quiet dignity, answering their questions about himself & the medal.  he bore my questions & chat with dignity.  all i had to offer to him in return was a mere, meager, "thank you".  i'm sure he'd had that before, and i pray he had it since, but i was honored to be in his presence & to have the ability to offer such a thanks.


we boarded the plane, and as we always keep the kiddos on until last to avoid the crush to get off, i didn't get to speak to him again.  i never did catch his name, and never really knew enough of his service to find him on the congressional medal of honor society site.  sadly i don't know if he is still living or if he has since passed.  what i do know is that for one fleeting moment in time, i stood beside & chatted with, a real hero.  i know that one of the, still giving, gifts of his service & his life is my thankfulness for the smallest moment to speak to him.  to offer to him the true thanks of myself, for everything he endured.


i never got to meet my great-grandfather, he passed long before my birth, but i did get to meet a man who bore arms at the same time he did.  maybe a different theater, a different version of the same nasty enemy of freedom, but a man of quiet honor none the less.  i hope he knew just how much it meant to me to get to speak to him, to get to offer him a humble, simple thanks.

infamy







mr. vice president, mr. speaker, members of the senate and the house
of representatives:
yesterday, december 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy -
the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by
naval and air forces of the empire of japan. 
the united states was at peace with that nation, and, at the solicitation
of japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor
looking toward the maintenance of peace in the pacific. 
indeed, one hour after japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing
in the american island of oahu, the japanese ambassador to the united states
and his colleague delivered to our secretary of state a formal reply to
a recent american message. and, while this reply stated that it seemed
useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained
no threat or hint of war or of armed attack. 
it will be recorded that the distance of hawaii from japan makes
it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks
ago. during the intervening time the japanese government has deliberately
sought to deceive the united states by false statements and expressions
of hope for continued peace.
the attack yesterday on the hawaiian islands has caused severe damage
to american naval and military forces. i regret to tell you that very many
american lives have been lost. in addition, american ships have been reported
torpedoed on the high seas between san francisco and honolulu. 
yesterday the japanese government also launched an attack against
malaya.
last night japanese forces attacked hong kong.
last night japanese forces attacked guam.
last night japanese forces attacked the philippine islands.
last night the japanese attacked wake island.
and this morning the japanese attacked midway island.
japan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout
the pacific area. the facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves.
the people of the united states have already formed their opinions and
well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.

as commander-in-chief of the army and navy i have directed that all
measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember
the character of the onslaught against us. 
no matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion,
the american people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute
victory. 
i believe that i interpret the will of the congress and of the people
when i assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but
will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again
endanger us. 
hostilities exist. there is no blinking at the fact that our people,
our territory and our interests are in grave danger. 
with confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination
of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. so help us god. 
i ask that the congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly
attack by japan on sunday, december 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed
between the united states and the japanese empire. 
president franklin d. roosevelt - december 8, 1941



december 7th, one of the most defining moments in american history.  while you remember those who died at pearl harbor, remember their brethren across the pacific.   my great-grandfather was in the philippines, thankfully he survived but others were not so lucky.  other families still don't have their dead to bury, remember them.  remember our allies who were attacked and brutalized.  not only americans suffered that day, not only hawaii suffered that day.  remember all those who gave their lives on a date which will live in infamy.

petreus, et al





enough with coddling this dumb bastard because he had 4 stars.  enough with the throwing tantrums that the self absorbed dick is having to answer to his crimes.

the sheer number of americans who have no morals astounds me!  the number of people defending him from any form of punishment because of "bad judgement" is beyond me.  he knows the ucmj.  he punished those below him for far less with far worse punishments.  why should he get a fucking pass because obama likes him?  the ucmj is quite clear on what a crime is & what the punishment is.

when the top spy in the country can't keep an affair secret, and his mistress is a total nutjob who threatens to physically harm people how can anyone trust that moron's judgement?

he leaves days before benghazi is investigated.  nah, the msm & dems swear there's nothing fishy there!

he gets told privately by the fbi he's under investigation, and urged to resign after the election.  nah, the msm & dems swear there's nothing fishy there!

his mistress threatens a "family friend" who's been reported to share inappropriate emails with another general serving in afghanistan.  nah, the msm & dems swear there's nothing fishy there!

his "family friend" is an 'honorary ambassador' & calls the fbi demanding they offer federal protection to an ambassador.  nah, the msm & dems swear there's nothing fishy there!




so from this i gather the potus is an idiot who has toadies & flunkies incapable of even the most basic of vettings.  congress helped cover it up because then there would be questions those stupid american voters would want answered about terror attacks, crazy bitches with access to supposedly important men, and why there's the double standard.


fry his ass!!  hang him out to fucking dry!!  same with his anal raping comrades, and those stealing government funds for their afghani mistresses & families!!  the o corps has proved that is nothing more than degenerate bastards that protect each others dirty secrets so they don't get snooped on in turn.  that's not the kind of people i want in charge of my husband, my family, a military base, or anyone else.  the dod & the joint chiefs & the pentagon are just as filthy, dirty, and nasty as the disgusting politicians they crony with & toady for.

i will never apologize for demanding that equal under the law really mean that!  i don't find that jumped up self absorbed dick to be of any more importance than an a1c or a corporal.

feel free to kiss my ass on thinking an officer should obey the rules they enforce.

the walking dead *spoilers, spoilers, spoilers*





i am all over this tv show.  from the first 5 minutes when rick plugs the bunny slipper little girl zombie, to hershel's farm, to crazy ass shane, to the most bad ass darryl (played by norman reedus).  we're on season 3, and omg!!!!!!

for those of you who don't watch, i'm so very sorry.  for those of you who do - don't read unless you've seen the latest episode!!


*spoilers!!!!!!!!   spoilers!!!!!!!!  spoilers!!!!!!!!* 

i'm not kidding people, if you keep scrolling you'll see things you don't want to!





**spoilers!!!!!!!**             **spoilers!!!!!!!!**       **spoilers!!!!!!!!**





whew, now that we got that out of the way, omg!!!

rick has flipped his fucking lid.  he's also become the most awesome zombie cleavin' machine.

darryl is a warm fuzzy wrapped in layers of bad ass, kick ass, and redneck.  i hope to hell he never meets meryl again, and if he does i hope he kills his ass.

i'm glad lori is dead.  i've hated her character since i read the comics.  the actress actually made me hate her more, which i suppose is proof of her ability to act her part well.

carol, bitch is dead!  darryl didn't put a cherokee rose on a grave with a "c" shape in rocks just for fun.

tdog.  man!!!!  i liked him!  he was so seriously underutilized by amc.  this one i actually miss.  he had so much more he could give.  :(

carl, even in a prison the punk won't stay in the damn house!

andrea, please fucking kill her!  i hate her.  she's drunk the governor's koolade & fucked over michonne!  bitch needs to die (hopefully in that fucked up version of a gladiator ring).

michonne, i <3 a="a" actress="actress" br="br" doing="doing" fantastic="fantastic" have="have" her.="her." is="is" job="job" nbsp="nbsp" playing="playing" she="she" the="the" they="they">

hershel, dude, you're one tough mother!  i think you could whip my ass any day of the week.

glen.  wow, he's actually a really well rounded, fleshed out character.  i'm glad to see it.

maggie!  maggie is one fantastic girl.  everything from cuddling a newborn who's mom got plugged to prevent her turning (but who got munched anyway), to a hell of a zombie killer (with apparent glee), to a romantic interest.  i am really, really glad to have her on the show.  she's a good balancing element when the show dearly needs it.

kitchen nightmares - season 4





well it's that time again!  time to see how many restaurants gordon ramsay can save in the us and how many have crashed & burned (some spectacularly).  per the wikipedia list of the season 4 episodes, filmed in 2011, we've got:

s4 - ep1.  spanish pavilion in harrison, nj.  open for business. *woo hoo!, a good way to start off the season!

s4 - ep2.  classic american in west babylon, ny.  open for business.  *two for two!  don't think it will last long though, not with previous seasons.

s4 - ep3.   pj's steakhouse in queens, ny.  closed.  *there is currently a thriving restaurant named manor oktoberfest of forest hills, ny.  pj's took a nose dive after ramsay was here, changing to a bar that also went tits up.  clearly the location isn't a problem but the previous owners were.

s4 - ep4.  grasshopper also in carlstadt, nj.  open for business. *this has got to be one of the weirdest named restaurants i've ever heard.  i think of chocolate mint cookies & kung fu, not really food.

s4 - ep5.  davide in boston, ma.  open for business.

s4 - ep6.  downcity in providence, ri.  closed.  *the last review is from january of 2012 so they do seem to have survived for about 6 months post ramsay.  won't label it a draw though as it didn't last very long after it was filmed.

s4 - ep7. cafe tavolini in bridgeport, ct.  closed.  *there is currently another restaurant at the same location, named "black rock yacht and athletic club".  

s4 - ep8. kingston cafe in pasadena, ca.  open for business.  *it was reviewed just a few weeks ago so seems to still be going strong, and it continues to get high marks for the food.

s4 - ep9. la frite in sherman oaks, ca. open for business. *apparently doing well enough that there are 2 locations listed on their website.

s4 - ep10. capri in eagle rock, ca.  open for business.  *last review was a few days ago so still going quite well.

s4 - ep11. zeke's in metairie, la.  closed.  *listed as looking for a new owner as of last month.

s4 - ep12. oceana grill in new orleans, la. open for business.  *the reviews are all over the board on this place with no rhyme or reason i could find so i suppose being open is worth something but if you're ticking off customers this bad, it is only a matter of time ...


well, that gives us a total of 8 restaurants still open which is a great improvement over the last few seasons.  that said, 4 are closed (2 of them with new restaurants in the same place).  so open is the winner for this season, as of now.
