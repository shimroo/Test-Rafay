what our clients say














10 moves in 10 minutes is perfect
chrissa b.




as a busy mom and entrepreneur, i have limited time for my own health and well being. i need quick, 10 minute full body workouts that are fun and simple to do. i found these workouts to be ideal for me! i’m a big fan of what critical bench has designed.
									







j


effective and simple workout program
john t.




i highly recommend isometric strength training by critical bench. all that you really need is your body and some time, and you're good to go. very effective workout program. i am very satisfied.
									













mom of 3 approved
becky m.




critical bench’s fitness programs are amazing! having my third baby really took a toll on my hips and legs - as soon as i started this program, not only did my inner thighs feel firmer, but i had less back and hip pain. it feels good to have my pre-baby body again! i highly recommend any of critical bench’s programs!
									







s


good workout video for all parts of the body
scooter




this provides a good toning workout for all muscle groups. pre-pandemic i worked out at the y and did the cybex weight training circuit. this dvd, along with dumbbells give a workout that is just as good, maybe better. i use these along with a spinning bike and i don’t miss the gym at all.
									

















over 40? no problem!
mark w.




as a male over 40, i’ve tried just about every exercise regime imaginable, so i’m constantly looking for different things to keep my body guessing and my workouts fresh. i knew i just had to try this new product from critical bench. from day one, i knew this program was legitimate from the intensity level. keeping up with the program has been simple and works with my busy schedule.
									







m


fast but tough. perfect for maintaining on a busy schedule.
missler




i have been a body beast guy for some time now and decided to change things up from time to time with cross fit or other options. these workouts are quick but effective if you use the right weights. was not disappointed in the least from these by way of cardio, pump, and overall fatigue for short intervals. i continue to bounce between routines and this is a staple video for mixing things up.
									













no more gym intimidation
pam a.




fitness and bodybuilding have been a huge part of my life for over 30 years. i understand the need for activity and movement in our daily lives. i also understand how intimidating the gym can be for newcomers. this is why i think this program is ideal for anyone at any fitness level. i’m thrilled to be doing these workouts and following a proven method by people i trust. thanks critical bench!
									







p


great for us older guys
paul




great video guide on what exercises to do and how to do them. also shows what exercises work best together. highly recommended…
									

















incredible fat burning workout
joyce b.




i found this routine to be a perfect fit for my needs. it focuses on joint mobility and muscle flexibility. i actually do the beginner routine as my warm up and the advanced routine on its own day as a stand alone workout. i urge anyone to spend time doing a stretching program like this to feel and move better.
									







s


no joint pain with these workouts
sonya




i feel how they work. i don't feel pain in my joints. my arms are happy!













no more pain!
tiffany c.




this program is a life-saver! after teaching group aerobics for years, my hips and lower back started to hurt often. little did i know that the basic movements i was doing were actually causing my body to break down. i was introduced to critical bench and after trying a few of their workouts, i felt so good! not only did the pain i was having go away, but i noticed my legs firming up!
									







k


great workout
knittingmom




i went through the beginner workout and enjoyed it. the stretching felt good, and it was very easy to do. very satisfied.
									











c


quick and easy enough for yoga newbies
coco




i liked this yoga dvd because it was easy to follow along with as a beginner. i felt really good after doing it for the first time, calmer, less stressed and most of the tension in my body went away! it’s a short enough routine that it can be done everyday, but i alternate days with other exercises.
									










super fun & simple
ron e.




the #1 thing anyone can do every day of their life to improve overall health and function is to move. nothing outrageous, just some total body movements that help connect and strengthen the body. critical bench has created a great program full of stretches and exercises designed to restore balance, increase strength and it’s got me interested in living a more active lifestyle.
									







n


these are all you need for strength training
nick




these are really all you need for strength training. they use basic, time tested dumbbell moves to help you get the most out of your time. these dvd's keep it simple and straightforward. each workout is about 20 minutes or less. just a heads up to buyers, there is no warm-up or cooldowns on the dvd's.
									










targets the glutes from all angles
stephanie d.




training glutes is one of my favorite body parts to hit. this program really targets the glutes from all angles. from heavy weighted thrusts to simple bodyweight exercises you can do from home, this workout will definitely keep that rear view tight!
									











a


amazing workouts for my arthritic body
alicia




i was really skeptical about this. i have had arthritis since i was born. there are a lot of workouts that i've never been able to do. this is honestly the best workout i've followed off of a dvd. there are still some things i can't do, but there are some really easy ways to modify some of the workouts. this would be great for someone like myself or your average person.
									







s


getting stronger in less time
sonia




i started with 2 videos: no back strain stability ball, and firm & tight mini bands workouts. they are fantastic! they force me to focus on specific postures and muscles. i'm getting stronger with more balance. less time and more results.
									







ma


quick, fast and efficient
mary ann




this workout hits all the major body parts with minimal time. quick, fast and right to the point. thank you all at critical bench. i appreciate your dvd's!
									







b


simple exercise program
bonnie




so easy to follow and easy to keep up. love the simplicity of this workout!
									











a


love all your workouts
aaron




i am very pleased with the workouts i purchased! they are very descriptive, educational, and show each exercise perfectly!
									







p


encouraging in hard times
paul




for the past three months, i have been working through various podcasts from strong by design. from 2020, i have enjoyed your many posts, but one day you featured me and my body transformation journey. it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. in 2024, i plan on celebrating my 70th birthday by participating in a physique competition!
									







j


critical bench - body transformation
john




i wanted to reach out to you and let you know that your advice has been a tremendous help for me and in the first picture i weighed 400 pounds and after reviewing your information and reading every email you sent the last 3 pictures are me now at 195 pounds.
									







m


win win workout
mags




this is an excellent exercise program, with specific exercises to target problem areas. it’s easy to follow (and therefore maintain). by using body kinetics and the clear instructions, it is a win-win workout. thanks!
									











m


great workout even with limited mobility
mick




love it! i was on day two of working out yesterday. it was leg day and i have one leg with limited mobility. i used a kettlebell to do the “dumbbell” squat. this is very good information and will be helpful to still being able to get a good leg workout! thank you for the side views as well!
									







b


interesting and exciting workouts
bear




the variety of workouts and exercises is awesome, and the coaches make it fun, exciting and interesting. thanks for all you do!
									







b


56 year old beginner
bob




i’m 56 and i started doing these exercises about 6 months ago after years of little exercise and no weight training. the results have been impressive and i feel so much better about myself. thanks critical bench!
									







l


simple enough to commit
louis




i’m turning 56 next month and have been searching a long time for a simple workout routine to get back in shape, and this looks like the perfect one. simple, well explained, definitely something that i can commit to. let’s do this!
									











hv


lost 23 pounds
h.v.




joined the gym 5 months ago, lost 23 lbs so far and am already starting to see muscle definition and increased strength. 6 days a week at the gym. i’m 54 and wish i would have done this sooner! i feel great and seeing the results is so satisfying. thanks for these tips!
									







c


just what i needed
c




great workout program. i’ve been looking for a good home workout when my schedule prevents me from hitting a gym. you’re my new trainers! thank you for this.
									







ap


it works! 
a.p.




great workout and love how straightforward it is! no bs, no blah blah blah, just straight to the point and most importantly, it works!
									







l


feeling it in my core
leah




oh my goodness. i did your workout and already felt and saw a difference in my core! i’ll be doing these exercises from now on! thank you for sharing this with us!
									











nw


no gym required
nicolas w.




great stuff! i’ve been doing floor work since i was 50, i’m 63 now. i built my body with dumbbells and bars, which are much harder to recover from after 50. i use resistance bands with floor work - no gym needed, which is what i like.
									







tg


effective and beneficial
travis g.




all of these exercises are extremely effective. i’ve been following a similar program to get back into trail running, and i noticed benefits immediately. you’re not just increasing your speed, but also strengthening the connective tissues of your feet, calves, and ankles. nicely done.
									







jf


my dad loves these
justin f.




i gave my dad this workout. he never used to workout and laughed at the thought of lifting heavy weights all the time because it’s dangerous. now he’s always bragging about how much he loves working out!
									







t


awesome!
tonya




this was a new style of training for me and i was surprised at just how challenging it was! permanently in my rotation.
									











t


challenging, quick, functional
tessa




i really appreciated the simplicity of the moves, the clear directives from coach, no excessive instructions or talking, and the timer is awesome as it sets expectations.
									







mg


lots of fun!
matt g




first of all, let me say that i have literally no rhythm. i’m the world’s worst dancer. but that’s the beauty of doing this workout in your home…it doesn’t matter! my wife and i shared a lot of laughs as i tried to follow along with the coach. the instruction was great, this student just isn’t very skilled. i certainly built up a sweat! great workout and lots of fun!
									







h


awesome addition to workouts
hannah




don’t let the apparent simplicity fool you. training your balance is key to feeling more in control of your daily movement, even if you aren’t an athlete. the workouts are easy to follow and leave me feeling tired, yet energized as i go throughout my daily tasks. it’s also a good endurance workout so now maybe i’ll have more energy to keep up with the kids!
									







u


very easy to follow!
u




a very simple and easy to follow video, provided a great workout! everything is clearly explained and the pace was just right. i love that i could just hit play and follow right along without having to pause the video. there was a perfect countdown timer for the breaks too. i enjoyed this a lot!
