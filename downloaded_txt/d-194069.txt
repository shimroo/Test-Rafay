about
what is a 'melanoma'?




'melanoma' is a malignant tumor derived from melanocytes (hence its denomination), neuro-ectodermal cells found in the basal layers of the skin (> 90%), mucous membranes, and the eye. mediated through erroneus epigenetic dna code read-outs, melanocytes transform into neoplastic melanoma cells. they proliferate and spread through soft-tissues, lymph nodes, and the blood stream, thereby turning a local tumor into a systemic disease. untreated, melanoma is a fatal disease. melanoma cells can be detected in histology specimens, indicated by egg-shaped clear cells displaying excentrical disconfigured cell nuclei. intially, melanoma cells form single-cell units, followed by cluster formation. melanin granules may be seen or even spread, but may more or less be absent in individual cases.
