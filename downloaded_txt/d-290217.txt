bio


fundamental problems in managing our online media tools have become 
			an existential threat to our democracy. we can do better at managing the social value and truth 
			of media content, and having agency over how that is fed to each of 
			us. 

			 
the key is to restore the freedom of 
			impression we did not realize we had until the platforms co-opted 
			it.
			 
these ideas have been published in 
			tech policy press and elsewhere, and cited in an ftc report to 
			congress.

			bio


 
			fairpay is a radically innovative framework for 
			relationship-centered, customer-value-first revenue strategies for 
			the digital era. its varying forms can be adapted across a wide 
			spectrum of business contexts, both for-profit and non-profits. 

			 
 
			these ideas have been published in harvard business review 
			and other business press, and in scholarly journals. (fairpay is 
			an open conceptual framework and relationship architecture, not a product.)
