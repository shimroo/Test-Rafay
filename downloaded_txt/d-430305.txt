callsignswow, people on lol_meme and reflesh.  thanks for bringing it back to 2008, gals!  ain't nothing so satisfying as rehashing old gossip and talking shit about people on the internet, right?  there is such disgusting irony in you anonymous bitches calling her a mean girl.i have a question.  has there ever been a time when someone you cared about had their feelings hurt by someone else?  i mean, seriously, it sounds like a dumb question, but that's happened to you, hasn't it?  and the person you cared about, they weren't perfect, but they didn't deserve to be made to feel so bad about themselves, right?  no, really, have you ever tried to comfort someone who was crying because nasty, untrue things were said about them?  has that ever happened to you, feeling helpless, trying to make them feel better?i mean, jesus.  she's a real fucking person.  she questions her self-worth, just like you.  she makes silly faces, just like you.  she feels bad when people believe horrible lies about her, and so do i, and so would you.  give the anonymous bullshit a rest.  put your names to the awful things you say and own your opinions, or keep your opinions in more private forums where people can't be hurt by them.  your bullying is bullshit.  fucking own up to what you say, or don't say it.

callsignstonight, i went to see fall out boy perform live and free at the santa monica pier.  although sandwich_armada and koncupiscence were sorely missed, i had a magical time with amanda and frances - i missed hanging out with those girls!  they were my 2006-2007 concert partners in crime, and now that amanda's back in la for good, i anticipate much revival.  tonight, we ate mad shrimp at bubba gump (i tried cracking lobster and it went all over the place /o\) and drank a million drinks, and then went on the ferris wheel, and then played whack-a-mole.  i won whack-a-mole, but frances and i were playing against this kid, and i gave him my stuffed silver sonic the hedgehog prize, because you know what?  i'm just that kind of person.then, fall out boy!!!  ugh ugh, i hadn't seen them since december, and i missed them, i missed them so much!  joe's fro was huge and crazy and long and gorgeous, but no facial hair!  pete's emo swoop was in full effect beneath his purple american apparel hoodie.  andy's hair was long too, and he was shirtless.  patrick was - did you know i want to marry patrick stump?  i want to marry him and bear his children and cook him dinner.  i'm jealous of his girlfriend because she gets to be with patrick stump.  he looked and sounded amazing.  he's patrick stump!  he wore a white fedora and a white shirt under a vest with a tie.  oh, snazzy patrick.  *wiggles ring finger*they played all singles, opening with sugar and closing with saturday (okay, so that wasn't a single), and in between was arms race, 16 candles, grand theft autumn, dance dance, i'm like a lawyer, take over the break's over, etc - plus:pete: so we've got some good friends who are over in europe right now, and they're bummed that we get to play on a beach right now, so this is for them.patrick: [plays i write sins and sings the first bit]god, i love when they cover i write sins!  ♥  they also did their akon-into-r. kelly cover, which was hilarious, because pete pulled out the "patrick, nobody wants to see us together" and then patrick played random chords for like a minute, and pete was like "uh, dude?" and patrick was like "pete doesn't respect the fact that i haven't played this for seven months" and pete was like "dude, i respect how you look in that hat, i want to see us together, c'mon."  and then playing!  pete rested his head on patrick's shoulder like 4 distinct times, and went to his knees for patrick at some point.god, fall out boy.  you soothe my battered soul and are still my favorite band.  ♥ ♥ ♥  i hope you're seeing the dark knight tonight!(1 ambien makes me wake up at 6am; 2 makes me sleep til 9.  is the answer 1.5 pills?)

poll #1128841

the following is true regarding ryan ross and lynyrd skynyrd's "free bird"


view answers




if you shouted "free bird" at the end of a panic concert, ryan ross would get the reference, but wouldn't know the song.
14(37.8%)


if you shouted "free bird" after a panic concert, ryan ross would absolutely be able to play the song - if he felt like it.
8(21.6%)


if you played the solo from "free bird" for ryan ross, he would instantly recognize it as the music playing while jenny stood on the ledge and attemped to jump in forest gump.
15(40.5%)




a final thought on brendon's shirt from the video shoot: it can't be long now.eta:  ooh, you know, to that end, is "free bird" even relevant as an encore anymore?  (was it ever, was it always just a joke?)  what song do you think bands these days absolutely ought to know, as a last-ditch encore?

hot as ice in a betsey johnson

callsignsi recently watched the american playhouse production of sunday in the park with george, which won a bevy of tony awards when it came out.  sondheim is my favorite - how can you trust someone who doesn't like sondheim? - but this musical was a difficult one for me to parse.  while watching, i suspected that sunday in the park with george was written after sweeney todd and before into the woods, because the complexity of the musical dialogue was on par with the former, but  the patterns of the songs and interactions felt like a precursor to the latter.  (wikipedia confirmed my suspicion, and then i patted myself heartily on the back.  i also congratulated myself for recognizing cinderella's prince/the wolf and jim dial from murphy brown.)  i don't know.  i could feel, at the time, what sondheim was trying to do with that story, but it felt so insular.  the strongest moments of connection i felt were, unsurprisingly, when bernadette peters was singing her earnest little heart out.  even a narrow, pointillistic narrative about legacy can make me feel something, if bernadette peters is involved.  the woman's going to be 60 in february, and she still looks like this.  ♥_♥i just added a bunch of feeds to my friendslist; there's a preset filter for syndicated feeds, it's like a wonderful little built-in time waster!  any suggestions for great feeds or blogs to add?  here are the ones i already have: bestweekever, boingwonder, consumeristfull, crazydaysnnites, daily_kos, defamer, falloutboynews, gawker, hascheezburger, i_am_fashion, idolatorfeed, moby_journal, new_yorker_mag, nohartandsole, pitchfork, popapocalypse, stereogumrss, tonconrad, traviesblog, whedonesque, wilwheaton, xkcd_rss, youtube_blog.i cry out in the darkness: who besides joyfulseeker, stonedtodeath, ferris bueller and myself wants a bandslash heralds of valdemar au?

callsignsi just had my first cigarette since 12:20am on january 1st!  this two-a-day thing is going to be cake.  i don't know if i have any heavy, daily smokers on my friendslist, but if i do, let me heartily recommend my quitting plan to you, because 1) boo and 2) yah.  i'm not making new year's resolutions!  i'll keep quitting smoking slowly and i'll keep trying to eat better and i'll keep trying to cope with stress.  it'll be much like 2007, but with less bothersome thoughts and feelings.  yeah, less of that, and more positive thoughts and feelings, more trust in myself, more happiness, for me and everyone else, even you.new years and the first week of 2008 were low-key, relaxing and great.  ( want to hear about it?  here it goes!collapse )in other news, welcome back to 2000, where i've been mainlining a_karls's dvds of roswell and finding mid-second season to be adorable perfection.  i know it's been, like, a decade, but if anyone has any old roswell recs hanging out in their bookmarks, i'd take them with glad hands.  i like maria the best!  and kyle the sullen buddhist!  and, um, michael!fannishly, hmm.  i haven't been online much, but i caught the tail end of dear-mr.-urie-gate - haha!  ha!  hahaha!  and of course patrick's law and order, geeeeeeez.  and i keep checking panic's website, like maybe they're going to tease another song.  when's that single coming out?  when are honda civic announcements being made?  are they going to cancel the oscars?  does ryan ross dress up every year for his oscar party?  if they cancel the oscars, will he still dress up and watch a marathon of best pictures with a joint in a chanel cigarette holder that joe buys him?

all the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice

callsignsi want to say such a heartfelt thank you to everyone who sent me a holiday card.  i'm still at work, so i don't have your names handy, but every single one brought a smile to my face.  and the heartfeltiest of heartfelt thank yous to fuskeez for the lovely festival of lights candle that is now sitting on my nightstand, and clumsygyrl, who sent me the audiobook of america: the book, as read by the cast of the daily show.  fi, that's so amazingly thoughtful of you, i can't even believe it.  i've just finished the golden compass, and i don't get another audible.com download until january, and your gift is a godsend to my miserable commute.  thank you so, so much, my dear.  ♥i've been playing rock band with my boss's friends while i wait for sara's flight to get in.  i continue to kick some ass on the drums, and i did pretty well on the guitar and singing.  i am a rock band unto myself, is what i seem to be saying.  fannishly, here's what i've been wondering the last few days:
