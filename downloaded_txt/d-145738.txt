about region 5




the arabian horse association's region 5 encompasses alaska, washington, northern idaho, and western montana. region 5 has earned the respect of arabian horse competitors across the country. whether for show, endurance or dressage, horses from the pacific northwest are among the best in the nation. the quality and caliber of our region 5 horses are evident by the results of highly competitive shows such as the u.s. nationals, canadian nationals, and scottsdale.

    we feature stock buckle designs that can be customized by changing simple details with no custom charge.  
if you need completely custom we can create just about anything, and we are not limited to buckles.  we supply many types of western silver items and more, even the slightly odd item from time to time.  recently we created a 6 inch wide solid bronze piece that was needed for a very unique hood ornament!  not for an mbz or bmw, but a pick up truck, of course!
