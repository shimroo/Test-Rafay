subject:minor swings
security:public
mood: tired

this week has been much like being nibbled to death by ducks; a slow, moderately painful process involving a great deal of irritation. it began, inauspiciously enough, on monday morning when i realized that i had lost my right glove. it was just cold enough that morning to make this annoying. but even more irksome was the fact that this was not the first time: i am now the proud possessor of three orphaned black leather gloves, all of them left-handed. the rest of the week was a flurry of minor indignities. my computer stopped working in its docking station, my lcd screen started to fail, the dell tech kept rescheduling my appointment, i aggravated my forearm tendonitis (which afflicts both arms and about which i have nothing good to say) and i upended a meant-to-be-consoling cupcake onto my lap, embedding frosting for all of my coworkers to admire. fortunately, things have started to look up.  today's glorious weather meant that i got to drive to work with the top down, something that is always fun; my lcd screen is working again; and darlox sent me flowers, which filled me with glee (even if it is cliche.) but the oddest and most cheering thing was something i found at wruw. david byrne has a new album out, called "here lies love." it's a collaboration with fatboy slim and - i kid you not - is a two-cd concept album telling the story of imelda marcos' rise to political prominence. in club music form. it is amazing. if you want to listen for yourself, you can! npr has it here. i'm not entirely sure how i feel about the appropriateness of the subject matter, but i will tell you that i loved the execution enough that i am compelled to mention it to you all.

security:public
mood: pleased

well, we're only a week into the new year, so i'm being almost timely in making my annual book post! (usually this happens at the end of january...)
i am interested to note that my numbers have been in a steady decline since i started keeping track: this year, i managed to complete (only) 70 books**, down from 74, 85 and 102 in previous years. what i did do this year was increase the proportion of first-time reads: 45 of my 70 were new to me, and i've gotten some new favorite authors out of the deal. of the new-to-me authors, elizabeth bear, louise penney, ysabeau wilce and charlaine harris*** were my favorites. 

this year, i also encountered quite a few books in which i read well more than 50 pages before giving up (per nancy pearl's advice), though in some cases i got much further before stopping in disappointment, despair, boredom or simply running into a library due date. those don't count here, though: if i didn't finish it, it's not on the list. 
in presenting the list, i've decided to stick with last year's format and begin with the breakdown of new reads and re-reads before presenting the whole list with commentary for those who care to read it.

**i was a bit lax about keeping track of my reading this year, so it's entirely possible that i left a book or two out when i neglected this list for months... 
***i was given the first sookie stackhouse book for christmas last year, and kind of chewed through the entire series by the end of september.

subject:when baking goes bad
security:public
mood: tired

cookie baking is a major part of my annual christmas to-do list: i'm typically responsible for making 5-6 different things for the family boxing day party.  i decided to block out today (well, yesterday technically) for the task and, aside from waking up in a delicate state after a fun holiday party and christmas ale aftermath, things went well! i was able to knock out my four beloved standards without major mishap.  and then there was the fifth recipe...the fifth recipe was my experimental cookie for the year, a linzer roll cookie from nick malgieri's "cookies unlimited." i followed the steps exactly, with the exception of the part where you're supposed to roll the dough into a single square and then immediately spread each rectangle with jam before rolling them into tight cylinders. i took a guess  on the intermediate step and cut the square in half, spread each half with jam, then tried to roll it. hilarity ensued!i baked them anyway. i'll make a call on edibility tomorrow, but they're not pretty. i don't think these are destined for a cookie tray anytime soon...

subject:aaaaaand i've already made a liar of myself
security:public
mood: tired

(two days with no post. whoops!)since i last wrote, christmas has visited the household with a vengeance. we managed to get about half of our outdoor lights up last sunday before the combination of darkness and dead strands forced darlox off the ladder, but the rest of the house remained bare of decoration until yesterday.  in the last 24 hours or so, though, three traditions have been upheld:1. we bought a tree: this year, a 7.5' scotch pine. pretty, if slightly curvy. 2. we hauled the decorations down from the attic so as to light the tree and festoon it with garlands. (embarassingly, the christmas decorations have only been in the attic for three months; they lived in the guest bedroom for almost the entire last year.)3. the cats knocked the tree down overnight. fortunately, there were no ornaments yet on the tree, so the destruction was minimal even if the mess was large. unfortunately, the crash broke the tree stand, so i ran out this afternoon to buy a new tree stand for our poor, parched tree. we're leaving the tree undecorated for one more night to see if we have a repeat or if the novelty has worn off. since all of this excitement has been paralleled by preparations for the annual cookie baking (10lbs of flour, 10lbs of sugar and 3lbs of chocolate acquired; recipes being considered; time to bake being blocked off), serious contemplation of christmas presents (aahh! stress!) and attendance at a few holiday parties i think my christmas season has officially arrived.

subject:at the intersection of technology and introspection
security:public
mood: contemplative

this past weekend my life changed a little, hopefully for the better: i got my very first smart phone.as an arriviste to this ever-less-exclusive group, i spend about half of my time being baffled by the things that result from my actions: multiple apps open, i accidentally send texts while only halfway through, i failed to figure out how to answer my phone three times when people called me… in short, the learning curve is a fierce one for somebody unfamiliar with touch screens and tiny keyboards.i also have grave concerns about the growing trend of data ubiquity, loss of privacy and sheer bad manners that i associate with smart phone ownership. but i have finally been seduced by the dark side!so  i got a droid.i originally was looking at the droid eris, but the physical keyboard (tiny as it is), universal inbox, integrated navigation options and 480x854 resolution screen (!!) on the droid won my heart.  the droid camera has been panned hard, but i’m a woman who picks her purses based on their ability to hold a wallet, keys, water bottle and an slr with zoom lens… so i’m less concerned about my phone camera quality right now than some.my biggest hope is that the phone will help me keep in touch better. now that my (work) laptop isn’t my only source of internet access, it will be easier and more likely that i can hope onto lj or facebook and catch up with you all or make posts of my own.but. as prone as i am to little bouts of optimistic self-delusion, even i am not so foolish as to think that technology alone will create such a miraculous change in my habits.  so i am going to follow the advice of mano singham* and commit to writing every day. now, this may not appear in a public forum. and i can’t say that these bouts of writing are going to be lengthy. (mano himself advocates 90 minutes a day before he rewards himself with such treats as email or internet access. hah.)  but i think that it’s important to reach out a little more and to exercise my poor, atrophied writing brain. and so, i’m going to give this writing daily thing a shot, with the hopes that i become a better blogger and a better communicator in the process.  we’ll see if the droid helps or not.*one of my idols of intellectual curiosity, academic rigor and all-around-nice-guyness. he has a new book!

mood: sick

i've been home sick this afternoon, and feeling sorry for myself.  i've caught that cold that's making the rounds, and it has reduced my brain to mush. (it sucks. i have already popped my floating rib with the coughing, giving me days of fun to look forward to.)[oh, hey, ayb2 just called me! i hacked up a lung at her so, um, sorry about that, ayb2! i'll call back when i'm human again...]i've been doing load after load of laundry because that's mindless, but i'm currently trying to watch lethal weapon ii and it is just way too challenging for me to comprehend right now, never mind that i've seen it about a dozen times already.  (although joss ackland is pleasingly evil, as ever.)[and this is a contribution from the cat, who is being unusually lovey: mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm]apart from the whining, i also wanted to say that it was really, really great to see so many lovely lj folks on monday. i'll try to upload some of my photos of the palimpsest reading when i find my brain and a card reader.   in the meantime, avoid the plaguey folks like me, and stay healthy!!eta the over-abundance of parenthetical asides are actually pretty representative of my current state of mind. view them - and me? - accordingly.

mood: contemplative

better late than never and all that... but it's well past time for me to make my annual book post. compared to the last few years, i was a little lax this year about keeping track of what i read and when (particularly when), but i did manage for the most part. as usual, my numerical goal was 100 books, and as usual, i missed. 
this year i made it to 75 in total, which is one more than last year. unlike last year, however, i don't have a masters thesis to show for it. i can only blame the mental vacation i took. ;-) i did a lot of re-reading this year, but i'll still count those books towards the total. in a couple of cases, that happened because i carried the same e-books on major trips at the beginning and end of the year. there were also a half-dozen books that i made major progress in before stopping for no reason - most of those books are on my bedside table so i can revisit them.
this year, i'm presenting the breakdown of first-reads and re-reads before i present the complete list with commentary; i think it's a little easier to follow this way, for those who care to try.

there are (quite a, to be honest) few things more disheartening than being home sick on a work holiday. it's even more of a gyp than being sick on a weekend. and trying to get work done during that holiday just makes the whole experience vaguely insulting.that said, i'm going to take advantage of enforced idleness to catch up on some lj chores, maybe sort a few photos, and touch base with some of you - i've been lax about reading lately, let alone posting. in the meantime, i hope you're all enjoying our lovely winter weather! i'm thinking soup and a fireplace are in order...

so this is a quick post just to say, hello lj friends! i've been offline for almost a month here, so i'm feeling waaaay out of touch.  therefore, and because i am too jetlagged/tired/lazy to actually make my way back through a month's worth of updates (y'all are prolific!!)  i'm going to make the usual request: if anything of import or interest has occurred to you in the past month that you think i should know about, please point it out! i may make some inroads on my friends list backlog, but am dubious. in the meantime, merry christmas, happy boxing day, happy hanukkah, and a happy happy new year to you all!!

subject:*whimper*
security:public
mood: sore and tired. also whiny.

so, one of the many things that i haven't told you about, land of lj, is that i've been learning how to sail this summer.  it's great! there's this women's racing league that focuses on teaching and encouraging new sailors, so even though i'm learning by being thrown into the absolute deep end, it's quite fun. there's a lot of yelling by our skipper(s), frequent confusion, and periodically piles of bodies on one side of the boat or the other that make it look like we're attempting to play tackle football when really we're all just lunging to grab the same lines. thus far my greatest triumph for the summer is that i haven't succumbed to seasickness, a near-miracle given my susceptibility. races are held approximately every two weeks, on tuesday nights, which is a nice schedule, except that right now we're racing every week in an attempt to make up for some early summer bad weather. last night was a make-up race night and it turned out to be one of the physically hardest things i have done in years!things started a little ominously, with lowering clouds and choppy waves on the lake, but the wind was brisk and we weren't rocked too much. the wind then became very brisk, making the race rather exciting. my task for the night was to help run the jenny and the spinnaker, along with another newbie, erin. this is what we've been practicing, but we haven't ever practiced with as much wind as we had last night, and it was hard to get the sails in. lots of pulling, lots of cranking, lots of precarious standing on the low rail to get a grip on the winch handle... by the end of the race, my hands were cramping and my lower back was starting to spasm. and then the race committee announced that they'd be starting a second race five minutes later! a little numbly, we reset the boat and headed back to the starting line for another race. (a second race in one night is nearly unheard-of in the women's league. we were all surprised.) the second race was faster than the first, but we didn't race quite as well: we were tired, there is no doubt. all in all, we actually did reasonably well. we probably placed second or third in both races. the predicted wind speed was 5-10mph, but the nearest weather station reports wind speeds of 16mph and gusts of 23mph and i'd believe it.  we never lost control, but some of our tacks got preeeettty tippy. i never had a foot entirely in the water while cranking, but my feet did get wet. all that excitement and adrenaline have left me a wreck today, though. my hands are surprisingly fine but my arms hurt, my legs are sore (like a good workout would do), i feel somewhat hungover, and i have a stunning collection of bruises and welts all down my knees and shins. the worst, though, is the muscle i have clearly strained or pulled in my lower  back. i can't sit up straight, i walk like my left knee is locked, and i can barely bend over.  and what am i doing tonight?!  sailing again.
