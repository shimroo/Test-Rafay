                                        i found it easy to order online. but most importantly great customer service. the day delivery was scheduled to the school where my wife works happened to be a snow day and the school was closed. the florist called me to make arrangements for a different address but was able to postpone to the next day instead. i appreciate the follow up especially since it was only two days before valentines day.

                                        recipients said the flowers were “so beautiful!” the photo they sent looked at least as good as advertised. very happy.

                                        beautiful arrangement that far exceeded my expectations and experience with other local providers. delivered on time and by (what i’m told) was a friendly and courteous driver. will definitely make these folks my “go-to” in the future. thanks for a seamless experience  during the busiest time of the christmas/holiday season.
