welcome to the mc sailing association



the mc sailing association originally formed in shreveport la, 1971. since then, the mc class has grown to be one of the top one-design sailboat racing classes in north america. the scow design maximizes speed yet provides unmatched stability. there are more than 113 active fleets nationwide. an original design by the melges family in 1956, it is unique in the fact that you can sail single-handed or double-handed. sailing solo is easy, taking a crew is fun! the mc class is not just about racing -- it has also been described by many people outside of the class as a very enjoyable and fun group to spend a weekend with!

please look around and explore the activities taking place at a nearby lake (over 115 fleets can be found here:
(mc active fleet finder) and see why we're so enthusiastic about this one-design racing sailboat.
