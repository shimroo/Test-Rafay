text-image generator.





by using the text-image generator you can easily create your individual text art image. unlike other ascii and text converters the content of an image is represented by different letter scaling. the text to be used is up to you. depending on your needs, the photos can be converted images with two or more colors. this web application is optimized for large images to print them out later.

avatar portraits.





turn your twitter avatar into some generative canvas magic with avatar portraits, created by kent brewster. avatar portraits collects color values and positions, and starts drawing circles with random sizes and tiny random offsets from where each color sample was taken.


it runs for about 20 seconds, long enough to develop most of what you're going to get, while leaving some of the interesting batik/pastel texture intact. enter your twitter nickname down there where you see kentbrew.
