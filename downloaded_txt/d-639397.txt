the chamber’s diverse membership provides an extensive network within which businesses and organizations can flourish by supporting each other and working together to build a stronger community. quality communities – the ones where companies want to locate and where people want to live – must have a strong local economy. a healthy, local economy depends on developing and maintaining a citizenry that cares about the community and is actively engaged in meeting the challenges it faces. our “citizenry” – the business community, local government, community organizations, and individuals – must work together, utilizing all the opportunities and assets within yorktown’s boundaries to make it an even better place to live. the
yorktown chamber of commerce is committed to being a vital part of that process by helping to build local businesses.﻿
