upward bound



overview february 1, 2019 



  uc davis upward bound is a federally funded educational
  program. the goal of upward bound is to provide high school
  students who are low income or whose parents who did not
  attend college better opportunities for attending college.
   we offer both a summer
  program and academic support during the school
  year. we offer these services to students who qualify at
  our partner
  schools located
  in sacramento, shasta, siskiyou,
  and solano counties.
