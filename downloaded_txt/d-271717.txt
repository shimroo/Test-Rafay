biological sciences is evolving
in fall 2013, three new biology departments - department of integrative biology, department of molecular biosciences, and department of neuroscience - were officially instated in the college of natural sciences at the university of texas at austin.
the departments were created to reflect the changing field of biology, as greater connections emerge between biology and computer science, mathematics, engineering and physics, and to promote innovation in biology research and education. 
the faculty and staff associated with the three new departments were previously part of the school of biological sciences, which has been dissolved.
a unit called the biology instructional office has been created to support undergraduate biology education, which spans the three new departments.
