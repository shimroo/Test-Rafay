federal reserve




 


one of our british authors, c.j. stone, just forwarded me the below movie that outlines just how corrupt and illegal the federal reserve is and provides an intriguing method to protest it.
movie:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp2jpy-j8ma
(the original video was removed. original transcript below. the above might not be an exact copy.)
website:  http://www.myspace.com/greatamericanstrike
synopsis for both:  strike (e.g. call in sick) to abolish the federal reserve on the irs tax filling deadline day, april 15, 2008.
other interesting related thoughts to do that day:
- wear white armbands.
- pull your money out of banks. (put it back the next day?)
- don't buy anything.
- initiate a complete monetary strike (e.g. do nothing that requires money to change hands).
- initiate a total us strike (e.g. do nothing that day, stay home with the kids and play).

i admit i like the last idea the best.  no work, no school, everyone just stays home for a day.  play some games, have a nice lunch, walk to the park, enjoy your family for a change...

what seems truly telling is that the the new york times has run an article about the upcoming truckers fuel cost strike (see: to protest fuel costs, truckers plan idle day), but nary a peep about the fed strike.  the corruption in our system just boggles the mind.

the movie is, in a word, annoying and the pace is deadening, so i've included a textual transcript below, that while not perfectly formated, will give you the message without making you suffer.  there's probably a few typos and i might have missed a slide...

this is the most important video on youtube....
...if you choose to participate and if you forward this video to others.
two thousand years ago, a roman senator suggested that all slaves wear white armbands to better identify them.
“no,” said a wiser senator.  “if they see how many of them there are, they may revolt.”
today, you and i and all americans are the slaves..
let us see, how many are read to revolt.
exodus 20:15
thou shalt not steal.
“steal”
to take the property of another wrongfully and especially as a habitual or regular practice.
the irs  steals from the americans to profit private bankers...
100% of the money collected by the irs goes to pay interest to banks.
for money that they never loaned, a non-existent debt.
“it is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”
-- henry ford
“we have in this country, one of the most corrupt institutions the world  has ever know.  i refer to the the federal reserve board.  this evil institution has impoverished the people of the united states and practically bankrupted our government.  it has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it.””
-- congressman louis t. mcfadden
“i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.  already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance.  the issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.””
-- thomas jefferson, u.s. president.
“history records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it's issuance.”
-- james madison
“most americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders.  the accounts of the federal reserve system have never been audited.  it operates outside of the control of congress and manipulates the credit of the united states.”
-- senator barry goldwater (rep. ar)
“if, as it appears, the experiment that was called “america” is at an end ... then perhaps a fitting epitaph would be ... “here lies america the greatest nation that might have been had it not been for the edomite bankers who first stole their money, used their stolen money to buy their politicians and press and lastly deprived them of their constitutional freedom by the most evil device yet created --- the federal reserve banking system””
-- g.d. mcdaniel
what we propose is ...
a one day, national strike, to make everyone aware of the numbers of people who are aware of this deceit.
whereas:
the federal reserve is an illegal corporation that operates for profit and is not part of the federal government of the united states of america.
whereas:
the federal reserve has stolen trillions of dollars from the citizens of the united states, without even having the constitutional authority to exist.
whereas:
the new world order could not continue its march to destroy america and it's freedoms without the help of the federal reserve stockholders.
whereas:
we can never have honest politicians as long as corrupt money from this corrupt organization keeps dishonest politicians in power.
...... all americans that favor abolishing the federal reserve and the income tax will be on strike or  calling in sick in  protest on april 15, 2008.
let's end the income tax and the federal reserve forever.  let's demand that the stockholders of the federal reserve return all that they have stolen by deceit.  they are common thieves and all that they own is owed to americans as restitution.
april 15, 2024
the beginning of the end
of the  enslavement of 300 million americans
