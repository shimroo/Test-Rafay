dan came onsite to take measurements, took my ideas for what i envisioned, and gave his professional opinion and recommendations which i really appreciated.  better yet, he produced a diagram and an estimate on the spot! i was able to make changes and get a timely revised estimate. i even had a last minute change that they were able to accommodate. what an amazing customer service experience. on top of that, the end result is exactly what i hoped and i'm excited to see my uncluttered garage everyday. thank you!

garage innovations from bid to finish is a top notch company. the estimate took about 30 minutes and to my surprise included a printed out 3d image of our garage, samples of colors and choices and an agreement to move forward without being rushed to buy or upsold on upgrades. the installation was beyond expectations and the installers took great pride in their work. very happy with the overall purchase and it sure is nice to see a company operate with such promptness, integrity and pride!
