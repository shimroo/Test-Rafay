since 1986, in my little shop in the 
      heart of the adirondacks, i have been building or restoring: 
      

adirondack goodboats - the unique 
          rowing/sailing/motoring boat that i designed to be an alternative to 
          the guideboat which has everybody in the adirondacks so mystified, as 
          if it were the only rowing boat that ever was. i've built 73 of these. 
        antique guideboats - by various 
          builders, at various prices. call for list. 
        rushtons
wood-canvas canoes
custom boats - such boats as 
          the charming electric launch lily, 
          the great uncapsizable trailer-sailer and camping-cruiser 
          birdwatcher, various flat-bottomed rowboats, or, in fact, anything 
          you like! 
      
 my goodboats and chipmunk canoes are available at half-price in complete 
        kit form, or at any stage of completion. opportunities occur for people 
        to come and work with me to build their own goodboats, build kit boats 
        of other designers, or apprentice to me. 

chipmunk 
          canoes, made by the 
          same constant camber method. sailing and sliding seat rowing versions 
          too. 


 i buy and sell small boats in a small way and like to consult on them, 
        using my small knowledge of what works well and what is available. 
       please look around the site for more detail on many of these subjects. 
        to learn more about me, read the builder's background.
