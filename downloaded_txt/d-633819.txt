dental implants
replace missing teeth

the loss of natural teeth can cause real struggles in a personâs life, both for their overall health
                    and
                    their day-to-day sense of self-confidence. if you find yourself in this situation, donât hesitate to
                    reach out
                    to our new haven dentists. weâre proud to offer state-of-the-art dental implants, which can faithfully
                    replicate the
                    natural structure of teeth and leave you with replacements that are virtually indistinguishable from
                    your
                    original smile. every stage of the treatment process is available right here as well for maximum
                    convenience.

dental crowns & bridges
restore healthy smiles

when a natural tooth isnât at its best, it may be difficult to enjoy favorite foods or smile in
                    photographs
                    without discomfort. thankfully, our nearby dental offices offer several high-quality
                    restorative
                    solutions for rebuilding strong, confident dental structure, including customized crowns and
                    bridges. dental
                    crowns are designed to preserve what remains of a natural tooth while also rebuilding its original
                    shape.
                    meanwhile, dental bridges can fill in noticeable gaps left by lost teeth and provide sturdy, reliable
                    replacements.

gum disease treatment
promotes oral health

if your gums seem noticeably red or routinely bleed when youâre brushing and flossing at home,
                    periodontal
                    disease may be to blame. this gradual oral infection should be taken seriously, and our team is here
                    to help.
                    our excellent hygiene departments provide dedicated screenings and professional therapy when needed
                    to combat
                    harmful bacteria and leave smiles revitalized. we want to help you maintain your one-of-a-kind teeth
                    for many
                    years to come!

orthodontic braces & invisalign®
straighten smiles

if youâre ready to finally say goodbye to noticeable gaps or crooked teeth, youâve come to the right
                    dental
                    team. our in-house orthodontic services can improve a smileâs appearance, health, and overall
                    function in
                    amazing, lasting ways, whether the patient in need is 7 or 77. if youâd prefer not to wear metal
                    braces,
                    teenage and adult patients may also be good candidates for invisalignâ®, which replaces the
                    traditional
                    bracket-and-wire treatment model with clear, comfortable aligners that are barely noticeable in
                    everyday life.

        frequently asked questions


            how do i get emergency dental care?


                calling 911 is your best bet if you have an issue that puts your life at risk (a prime example being a fractured jaw). but what about less immediately dangerous but still urgent dental problems such as knocked-out teeth? these types of situations are best handled by your dentist; the doctors at the hospital emergency room most likely wonât have the training to properly address the root of the problem.
 we can often schedule a same-day appointment for you if youâre in need of emergency dental care. when you call our office, please describe your situation as accurately as possible; itâs important for us to have all the details. additionally, you should follow any first-aid instructions that our team gives you. itâs important to see the dentist and have the problem dealt with as soon as you can before it can lead to an even bigger threat to your oral health.


            how do i find the best place to get dental work done?

when choosing a dental practice, some of the factors that might influence your decision include:

whether the practice will take your insurance.
whether the practice is in a convenient location.
whether the practice offers specific treatments that fulfill your current dental needs.
whether the practice is open at times that work for your schedule.

make note of the factors that matter the most to you. then search for a practice that fulfills your set criteria.
of course, you will also want to get a feel for what the practice is like in general. a good way to do that is to read the dentist’s online biography and learn more about their credentials. you can also read reviews to see what other people think about the practice. 

            how much does a dental checkup & cleaning cost in new haven, ct?


                you should ideally have a dental checkup and cleaning performed once every six months. the cost of such visits can be influenced by the location of the practice, your own dental health, and other factors. in the united states, the average price is between $200 and $350; however, if you want a more precise idea of how much your own visit will cost, itâs best to call our office and speak to one of our team members. 


            what do you do if you canât afford a dentist?

if you want to make paying for dental care easier, there are a number of options to consider:

use your insurance. our practice accepts metlife, delta dental of new jersey, aetna, and many other popular dental insurance plans.
apply for financing. thanks to carecredit, you can pay for your care in monthly installments with a payment plan that’s suitable for your budget.
sign up for essential dental plan. this is an alternative to dental insurance that offers benefits such as free exams and x-rays as well as a notable discount on a variety of services.
