speak to a biologist
























electrofishing evaluation


an electrofishing evaluation includes a comprehensive evaluation of your fish, water quality, water chemistry, vegetation, nuisance vegetation, and entrance fertility level. 





















fish stocking


whether you're stocking a new pond or re-stocking an existing pond, our friendly staff of experts would love to talk with you! 





















sportmax water soluble pond fertilizer


proper fertilization is a critical component to successful pond management. fertilization increases the production of "natural" forage by as much as 400%. this video discusses the merits and methods associated with proper pond fertilization. 





















weed control


"in order to make improvements in your lake, we have to have a baseline. the most important factor is listening to the customer and understanding the goals for the lake."–charles driggers, southeastern pond management auburn office 



















pond management services












fish stocking


we supply the highest quality, genetically improved fingerling bluegill, shellcracker, and largemouth bass, for stocking new ponds. generally, ponds which are roughly 25 percent full are suitable for stocking. 







learn more











pond fertilization


to dramatically improve fishing quality in your pond, fertilizing is one of the best investments you can make. coupled with liming, fertilization can increase fish production in your pond by 3 to 4 times. 







learn more













weed control


aquatic weeds can be a real nuisance. while some weeds may provide beneficial fish cover, others interfere with fishing and swimming as well as detract from the beauty of your pond. 







learn more








liming application


liming ponds is an essential component to effective pond management. most ponds in the southeast require the application of agricultural limestone in order to enhance water quality and much more. 







learn more











electrofishing


included in our initial analysis is a population survey, an alkalinity check (to determine lime requirement) and an aquatic weed assessment. 







learn more








fountains & aerators


the design and installation of aeration/destratification systems is an "insurance policy" against mother nature's wrath. although rare, summertime, "turnovers" can cause fish kills; in some cases, these kills may be devastating.
