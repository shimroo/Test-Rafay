school mental health is more important than ever, as educators and administrators recognize the critical role it plays in fostering student well-being, engagement, and success. recently, members of esu 13’s psychological and behavioral health team had the privilege of visiting gordon-rushville public schools (gprs) to learn more about the incredible strides they've made in creating a supportive and holistic approach to mental health for both students and staff. here’s a glimpse of the innovative work they’re doing to make mental wellness a priority.
a comprehensive mental health program
gprs recently participated in the school mental health institute grant program. this esu 13 program offered via nebraska department of education has helped to connect them to their successes. their approach is multifaceted, ensuring that every student and staff member has the resources and tools they need to thrive both academically and emotionally.
one of the standout features of their program is the creation of "calm corners" in each building. these spaces provide students with a designated area to take a break, relax, and regulate their emotions when they need it most. it’s a simple yet powerful strategy to help students manage stress and improve focus in the classroom. 
robin johnson, principal of gordon elementary school, shared her thoughts on the program's success:
"grps is taking mental health education seriously by creating a supportive environment with the help of the school mental health institute grant program. this partnership has had a transformative impact on our students’ emotional and academic growth. the training and tools provided allow us to proactively address our students' social and emotional needs. our school community has seen a significant improvement thanks to the additional resources and awareness programs, fostering a healthier and more supportive school environment.”

staff training on mental wellness
a key component of successful mental health programs is having well-trained staff. grps prioritizes this by offering ongoing training and professional development for teachers, counselors, and administrators. these efforts ensure that staff members are equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to support students’ emotional and mental well-being, fostering a school-wide culture of care and understanding.

integrating mental health into the sel mtss framework
in addition to the calm corners and staff training, gprs has thoughtfully incorporated mental health interventions at multiple levels of their social-emotional learning (sel) multi-tiered system of supports (mtss). this means that mental health support is tailored to meet the needs of all students, with interventions designed to provide additional support when needed:


tier i: universal interventions for all students, focusing on building a positive school climate and promoting social-emotional learning.


tier ii: targeted interventions for students who may need extra support, such as small-group counseling or check-ins.


tier iii: intensive, individualized interventions for students facing significant mental health challenges, with the involvement of mental health professionals as needed.



by embedding mental health into the sel mtss framework, gprs ensures every student, regardless of their needs, has access to the support they require to succeed both inside and outside the classroom.

a bright future ahead
what we saw during our visit to gprs was truly inspiring. their commitment to supporting the mental health of students and staff through comprehensive, well-rounded strategies is setting a shining example for other schools to follow. the team at gprs understands that mental health isn’t just a program—it’s a critical part of the school culture, and they are working tirelessly to ensure that it stays front and center.
"the grps staff is outstanding, consistently working hard to create a supportive and caring learning environment for all," said nathan livingston, superintendent of gordon-rushville public schools. "the school mental health institute grant program has been instrumental in enhancing our district's efforts to establish sustainable mental health support practices for every student. we are grateful for this partnership and excited to continue building on the strategies and practices we’ve implemented so far."
as we continue to advocate for the importance of school mental health, it’s clear that the work being done at gprs is a model for how schools can effectively integrate mental wellness into the fabric of their academic environment.

scottsbluff, nebraska, 12-05-24 ⎯ educational service unit 13 (esu13) is proud to announce that it has been awarded a prestigious usda rural development distance learning grant. this federal grant, totaling over $1 million, will enable significant upgrades to distance learning systems throughout the nebraska panhandle, enhancing educational access for students and communities in rural areas.
 
"this grant is a game-changer for education in western nebraska," said bj peters  
esu 13 director of technology, distance learning, and media. "it allows us to connect students, teachers, and communities in ways that were previously unattainable, ensuring that geographic location is no barrier to opportunity."
the grant will fund cutting-edge video conferencing and interactive technology for all 21 school districts in the esu13 service area. equipment upgrades include fully interactive zoom room classrooms and boardrooms, mobile zoom cart systems to convert any classroom into a distance learning hub, and all-in-one camera conferencing bars for interactive whiteboards. these advancements will:


address teacher shortages by enhancing teacher-sharing capabilities.


provide professional development opportunities for educators, administrators, and counselors.


reduce travel costs through virtual meetings and training.


facilitate class-sharing and collaborative learning among students in multiple locations.


make high-tech classrooms the standard across the panhandle.


 
dr. travis miller, superintendent of hemingford public schools, highlighted the significance of this upgrade: 
“i am thrilled that this grant funding will help ensure that the next generation of students in western nebraska will continue to have access to the high-quality and diverse learning opportunities available through the western nebraska distance learning consortium (wndlc),” said dr. miller. “the wndlc connects rural students to a wide range of educational resources. i deeply appreciate the work done by bj peters and his team to advocate for opportunities for our students, staff, and communities here in western nebraska.” 
beyond schools, the grant extends to community partnerships. mobile zoom cart systems will be provided to ft. robinson state park museum, chimney park visitor center, and agate fossil beds national monument. these tools will enable park staff to virtually share the rich history of western nebraska with audiences around the world. 
most of the equipment is expected to be installed by summer 2025, marking a significant step forward in educational equity and economic opportunity for the region. 
for more information about this grant or esu13’s distance learning initiatives, contact bj peters at (308) 635-3696 or bpeters@esu13.org.
