what my clients are saying  



i was very pleased in how she took time to explain things to me . gave me very helpful ideas in how to improve on things inside and outside. had put the for sale sign up in the afternoon and already had someone to see my house the next day and they bought it . how impressive is that !
 

    
~ home clients



mari was very thorough and persistent when it came to the sell of our home. her willing to go above and beyond was amazing. would use her again and recommend her to everyone we know!
 

    
~ happy clients



everything you read about mari in her profile is absolutely true. her professionalism, knowledge of the industry, her energy, and responsiveness make working with her an absolute pleasure. i had no idea the difference the right realtor can make in ones home buying experience. working with mari made our experience hassle free as she worked with the builder to work out the issues that arose during construction. i strongly recommend mari to anyone looking to settle into the san antonio area.
 

    
~ home clients



i am so thankful to have had the support and guidance of mari tello, when purchasing my home! she was always readily available to answer my questions and advocated in my best interest every step of the way.
 

    
~ home clients



mari went above and beyond for us in our home search and purchase. from a farm search to us ending up with a downtown renovated bungalow, she was with us every step of the way. always available with answers to our millions of questions, always professional and kind through every step. i will recommend her to everyone i meet! fantastic experience!
