[although i know you won't, i just have to put it out there]. if you like the artist support them, buy from yesasia and cdjapan♦ absolutely no flaming of the artists or the songs i post will be tolerated, i never said you had to like what i posted. so if you don't like it, then don't download it.♦ comment if you take anything i don't enjoy watching the little file uploading bar in my spare time, so i'd like to know that it is going to a good cause.♦ if the file runs out before the week is up [or before i upload new ones] simply ask for a re-up and i'll be more than happy to do it for you when i have spare time.♦ enjoy the music!requestplease email me [or just leave a comment on this post] with the following information [please do not request more than 2 at a time, but feel free to request as many times as you want.].your lj ::file(s) you wish to request [including band] ::and that's it, if you request a very large file [i.e. concerts, movies, complete discographies], please request only that for the time being_simplenclean_'s infoaim :: xgackt no yumexmsn :: xnew_age_culturex@hotmail.comemail :: email me?
