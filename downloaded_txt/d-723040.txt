making our state cleaner, greener, and more beautiful














our vision

at the keep georgia beautiful foundation, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a clean, green, and beautiful environment. by conserving our resources and keeping our landscapes free of blight, we not only provide green spaces that people and wildlife alike can enjoy, but keep communities safe and encourage economic development.as a state affiliate of keep america beautiful, we support more than 70 local affiliates across georgia and strive to increase our impact even further by engaging additional communities and individuals in our efforts to end litter, reduce waste, promote recycling, and beautify communities.
























our initiatives
we believe everyone should do their part to build and maintain clean, green, beautiful spaces. that’s why we take action every day to improve and beautify communities across georgia.






    end litter
  



in 2024 alone, our network of affiliates and volunteers cleaned up 1.5 million pounds of litter and debris across georgia. we’re incredibly proud of these numbers, but we also realize that preventing litter from happening in the first place is the ultimate solution.




    reduce waste
  



we believe the most effective way to protect our environment is to stop creating waste in the first place. by encouraging our network to reuse items and reduce what they send to landfills, we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sustain the environment for future generations.




    promote recycling
  



recycling benefits communities by preventing pollution and stimulating local economies. last year, we recovered 4.9 million pounds of recyclable material that would have otherwise sat in landfills, supporting our manufacturers and keeping our neighborhoods clean. 




    beautify communities
  



planting native trees, shrubs, and flowers not only makes georgia a more beautiful place to live, but aids wildlife, strengthens communities, and creates tangible economic benefits. in 2024, we planted over 40,443 trees, shrubs, and flowers in communities across georgia.














our impact



over the past year, our network of affiliates and volunteers have made amazing strides toward improving georgia’s environment by cleaning streets, parks, trails, and waterways.
