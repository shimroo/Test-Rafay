steve at frontendtech did an amazing job on our business site. he is very easy to work with, will go back and forth with you, educating along the way. the experience was as good as is the final product. our customers have had many great things to say about our new business site. i would not hesitate to recommend steve to anyone looking for site development work. i hired steve to build a site for our family business and i could not be happier. his patience is amazing and he educated me through the whole process. he was quick, responsive and paid attention to detail. we went through several iterations and finally narrowed down the look, feel and function of the site. great experience all around.

we hired front end tech for our new website after receiving several different quotes. after meeting with steve in person and going over the requirements and pricing, we decided to hire him. the process was seamless and we are happy with the results. the reason for our high-satisfaction (5) rating besides the website itself, is his responsiveness and support after the job was done. weâve had and continue to have minor edits here and there which front end tech has taken care of in a timely manner. some of these edits are critical for our business and are time-sensitive. so i would definitely recommend front end tech and their great customer service!

front end tech is a very experienced and skillful front end developer. they built two of my independent film websites which received a lot of positive feedback. i provided fet with photoshop lay comps. their attention to detail and skill sets turned these photoshop mock ups into beautiful online experiences. fet is also fun to work with. they are patient and courteous. i strongly recommend front end tech to anyone who has front end dev needs.

hello! iâm steve scheinberg

i have been lucky in my career to work with some awesome companies, and people. i love my career, and hope my passion shows in both my dedication and my final product. the last 21 years has been an amazing journey starting with the official gumby pokey and howdy doody e-commerce web sites. i am fortunate that i can both help people achieve their business goals, and make a living doing so. each day a new opportunity awaits; always learning from my customers and colleagues. 






my interests

cars: i love to drive, and try out new vehicles. i've owned quite a few cars that i would consider cool, from 69 vws, 65 mustangs, to lifted supercharged trucks, and modern m3 v8's. i collect matchbox cars, and am the vice president of bamca (bay area matchbox association). i own over 7,000 cars, and proudly display them as art in my home.
motorcycles: i've always driven motorcycles, since i was 14. i worked for keigwin's track days for ~8 years, and also ride dirt bikes. i ride every week, without fail. motorcycles bring not just freedom, but 50+ mpg!
pinball: i am in pinball league bapa (bay area pinball association), and i currently own seven full-size pinball machines. games include: metallica, funhouse, theater of magic, simpsons, the walking dead, and more. 
camping: spending quality time with my life partner, and my australian  cattle dog maya in big sur.
