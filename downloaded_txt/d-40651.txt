start here for the scoop on great garden sheds, arbors & 
pergolas


is your garden shed 
							filled to the brim? do you yearn to update your 
backyard and build arbor? 
                          this site takes a look 
                          popular wood sheds and garden arbors you can build 
							yourself.
outdoor storage
                            sheds
sheds are a very 
							practical structure that most people have in their 
							backyard. 
							and if you don't have one in your backyard you 
							probably really want one.  
they can add character to your backyard, but 
mostly they are a great place to store things. i want go into the details of 
what you can store in your shed, because you probably already know all of the 
thing you want to put in there.  
the other nice thing about these outdoor 
structures is that they are fairly easy to build and there are a few options 
available. you can purchase plans if you want to start from scratch and maybe 
modify the design. or you can purchase a kit, that will come with everything you 
need including pre-cut wood and all of the shed roofing material.  
for more information on these two options, i 
have created the pages below on what i've learned about building wooden garden 
sheds. please click on a link to learn more and good luck with your project:

							plans — 
							information and pictures on a variety of shed plans. 
							even if you are just thinking about building a shed 
							it is great to check out this page to get some ideas 
							for your next shed.


shed kits — 
							the first shed i built was a ready to 
							go shed kit. i picked out the shed i wanted and they 
							dropped off two pallets of building material. easier 
							to build than a shed from plans but a lot cheaper 
							than a custom built shed. 
garden arbors & pergolas



besides 
							being the best place to kiss in the garden, 
							the classic arbor supports or trains climbing 
							plants, such as roses or grape vines. you can 
							also build arbors that include benches or gates. 
							they are also useful to to designate the end of one 
							area and the start of another area.

you can purchase a complete arbor 
							that you just need to install in your garden or you 
							can get a kit that will require some assembly and 
							then you can install it. your other option is to use 
							a set of good plans and build the wood arbor exactly 
							as you want. this is also a cheaper option, but it 
							will take more time to complete. 

a pergola 
							is like an arbor only bigger, usually extending from 
							the house to cover a walkway or seating area. you 
							can also have a pergola in your backyard to provide 
							a nice shady are for those days you just want to 
							relax and take it easy.

							structures, i have created several pages with more
