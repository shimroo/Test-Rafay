update on giving tuesday, 2024
impact 100 has always been about making a difference – both for the nonprofits to whom we offer grants, and among the indianapolis community at large. since 2013 impact 100 has been making a difference in shaping the philanthropic perspectives of women early in their public service career through our leaders of the future scholarship program, which covers the cost of membership for promising philanthropists early in their career.
#givingtuesday was established to inspire people to improve their local communities by giving on the tuesday after thanksgiving. at impact 100 greater indianapolis, all #givingtuesday donations go into our leaders of the future scholarship program. this thermometer tracks the progress of this year’s donations. 

2024 grant recipients
(for an update on how the 2024 grant recipients used their grant funds, go to this blog p;age)
91 place will not forget june 11, 2024, where they were named the impact 100 2024 change maker!


91 place was the health & wellness focus area committee finalist. the organization serves homeless youth, ages 16-24, by providing transitional housing for up to 2 years using a comprehensive wellness strategy. the change maker grant will fund the creating permanency in transitional housing project. this project is an urgent response to the pending sale of their flagship home, which houses 4 youth and 2 house mentors. the home’s owners are offering the property to 91 place at a price far below its appraised value. this opportunity creates equity, avoids a costly and disruptive move and eliminates the necessity of finding another suitable house when few are on the market.
four other local nonprofits received unrestricted community support grants of $11,000 each:

arts, culture & preservation: iibada dance company, artsforce development project
education: kids ’voice of indiana, little voices, big futures
environment & animal welfare: medical mutt service dogs, mutt mentors fostering program
family: coburn place safe haven, two-generation rapid rehousing & supportive service program

19th annual awards celebration
this year’s annual awards celebration were held at the heirloom indianapolis, and the night was a huge success. proceeds from the wine and spirits pull and the cookie sales go to support impact 100’s “friend” fund, which helps us keep the ticket cost to the event down and supports operating costs and overhead expenses. these funds ensure that 100% of each membership donation goes directly to the annual impact 100 greater indianapolis grant pool.
a big thank you to all their members and their guests for allowing us to share how powerful empowering women in our community can be with impact 100 greater indianapolis. and a really big thank you to our sponsors, patrons, underwriters, and donors!
