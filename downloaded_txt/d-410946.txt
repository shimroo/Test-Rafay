defining expat lit, live on twitter may 29expatriate literature may be stocked in the travel section, but does it deserve a shelf of its own? we think so! travelers often have the luxury to avoid the very issues of assimilation and identity that dominate the expat psyche. anastasia will guest host a live chat on the micro-blogging service twitter to discuss the unique depths expatriate living can bring to expat lit’s combination of outsider-view-from-the-inside and journey of self-realization. all expat harem readers are invited to join in, and share their perspectives on this misunderstood genre: friday, may 29th, 4-5pm edt.visit www.litchat.net for more information. the only requirement is that you have a twitter account, then use either tweetchat or twitter search with the term "litchat" to see the on-going discussion.
