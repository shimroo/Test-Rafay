why proulx oil & propane 






contact us today!















 





there is a difference between price and value. on many occasions you shop around and compare pricing for goods and services. as you consider which companies you choose to do business with, many times the least expensive or one with an attractive introductory offer will not deliver the products and services you would expect. and that’s disappointing. 



at proulx oil & propane we know that you deserve to do business with a fuel provider who makes purchasing fuel, equipment, and service a stress-free experience. we are not a large corporation, so when you contact us whether by phone or email you will speak or correspond with a customer service representative in our newmarket, nh office who will treat you with kindness, and are reliable, helpful, and responsive to your needs.  when you have a complex or unique situation, our team will collaborate to find you solutions that minimize disruption and are cost-effective.
