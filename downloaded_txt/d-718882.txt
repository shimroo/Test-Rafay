 dear montana gun owner,
the montana shooting sports association (mssa) is the primary organization asserting the rights, privileges, and prerogatives of gun owners and shooting sports enthusiasts throughout our state. as your advocate in political and legislative arenas, mssa promotes and defends the rights of montana gun owners on issues that are facing us today.
hardly a day goes by that we don’t hear about some new anti-gun law somewhere in the nation. almost daily, we are threatened with the loss of our basic right to protect ourselves from rising crime. now, even our historical hunting opportunities are coming under attack.
montana is far from immune to the anti-gun campaigns now being waged against our citizens. do you want to stop these threats at montana’s borders? do you want to defeat the gun grabbers and preserve your constitutional liberties?
the montana shooting sports association believes that the only effective way to protect your rights to gun ownership, hunting and self-defense is through a strong, well-organized and united front. together, the members of mssa can be an invincible force that safeguards and enhances the rights of every montana gun owner.
since its inception, mssa has now gotten 71 pro-gun and pro-hunting bills through the montana legislature and signed into law, two or three times as many as our next closest competitor state organization in other states. mssa is simply the best in the us, by a long margin.
we need your help to continue this record. join mssa today! join a winning team. your membership enables mssa to fight, with uncompromising fervor, the legislative and political battles necessary to insure your inalienable rights. mssa membership is a small price to pay to preserve your gun ownership and shooting sport rights. it may be the most effective $25 you ever invest.
thanks loads,
gary marbut, president
