a tradition of distinction.
since establishing petros guitars in 1972, bruce petros has been building unique, custom, handmade acoustic guitars for discriminating guitar players and guitar collectors. by meticulously constructing each instrument from the finest master-grade woods and using innovative techniques, their guitars are some of the most sought after instruments in the world.  bruce has devoted most of his life to the pursuit of excellence in guitar making and he builds each guitar with both the player and the audience in mind, combining new technologies with time-honored craft secrets. his mission is really quite simple: to build guitars that sound wonderful and are a joy to play.in 2012, petros custom ukuleles brought the same world-class craftsmanship and instrument building mastery to the ukulele community.



 











continuing the legacy.
matt petros began spending every moment he could in his father’s guitar shop in the basement of their wisconsin home as soon as he was old enough to make it down the stairs. it was soon clear to his father that he had the same penchant for woodworking and innovating that his father did.today, matt builds the majority of each instrument produced at petros guitars. his extensive skills and abilities allow bruce to continue developing new models, tooling, jigs, and designs that keep petros guitars at the top of their game.



 











uncompromising craftsmanship. 
each petros guitar is built to an unsurpassed standard of excellence. from the rich  harmonic content of each note to the elegant purflex appointments, each guitar is not only an unrivaled instrument, but an exquisite work of art.
