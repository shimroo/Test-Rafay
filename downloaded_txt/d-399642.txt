this website has received praises from home educators, teachers, parents, and others from around the state and across the country. 

"your resource site is incredible! you have done such a wonderful job of compiling all the information needed for all of our homeschool familiesthank you for your hard work and dedication to all of us who will benefit from this site." 

i found your site while researching for art and architecture during the regency period. wow! i didn't know you existed. i am a teacher fed up with the current educational system and applaud your efforts in creating this site. 

"i could probably spend the rest of my life exploring the wonderful places that the links on this site lead to. it is a homeschooling website, but don't let that stop you. anyone with kids will find lots to check out. i think teachers can find a lot here. and anyone who doesn't have kids, but who like me has more curiosity than a cat will love this site as well."
