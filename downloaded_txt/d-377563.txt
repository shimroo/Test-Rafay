fun plaza


the fun plaza on ocean blvd. lives up to its name as one of the most entertaining north myrtle beach attractions inside and out. located just steps away from the oceanfront, and easy to get to for both area resort guests and beach goers, the classic open air plaza has been a north myrtle beach hang-out and entertainment center for generations - a legacy that is still evident by both its retro decor and old school arcade games.

myrtle beach, sc fishing charters, guide & more


myrtle beach, sc is a popular destination for fishing enthusiasts, offering a variety of fishing opportunities both inshore and offshore. the area is known for its abundant saltwater fishing, which includes species such as red drum, spotted seatrout, flounder, king mackerel, and more. inshore fishing is a popular choice for those looking for a relaxed day on the water and an opportunity to catch a variety of fish species in the calmer waters near the coast. offshore fishing, on the other hand, offers a more intense fishing experience as anglers venture out into the atlantic ocean to target larger gamefish such as tuna, wahoo, and marlin. myrtle beach is also home to a number of freshwater fishing opportunities, including the waccamaw river and numerous lakes and ponds. whether you're a seasoned angler or just starting out, the myrtle beach area offers a range of fishing opportunities for all levels of experience.








the 7 best beach & fishing coolers 2025


nothing beats an ice-cold beverage while relaxing on the beach. nothing is worse than reaching for an icy drink and finding your cans swimming. coolers are essential for family days on the sand. a good modern cooler will keep food and drinks fresh for days. in addition to beverages, fishermen rely coolers to keep bait fresh, and hopefully the catch of the day. walk onto any beach or pier in north or south carolina and you’ll see a plethora of cooler models and sizes. cooler technology has advanced rapidly in modern years. top-end hard-sided coolers can keep ice frozen for a week. soft coolers are easier for one person to carry onto a beach, but can still keep food cool for days. cooler materials and price points vary wildly, so we put together this guide with our recommendations for your coastal vacation.








myrtle beach state park


myrtle beach fans may be surprised to learn that this shoreline has a quiet side, but visitors who want to soak up a natural coastal south carolina landscape will find plenty of pristine and undeveloped room to roam at the myrtle beach state park. located along the oceanfront, just south of the grand strand's famed ocean blvd, and just north of the town limits of surfside beach, this surprisingly large parcel of maritime forest and quiet ocean beaches is a rare treat and a gem of a find for outdoor lovers who simply want to relax and soak up myrtle beaches' definitely quieter natural scene.

myrtle beach boardwalk


before there was the infamous jersey shore crew, or the southern california surfing hang-outs, there was the myrtle beach boardwalk. a southern icon for beach vacationers of multiple generations, from biker gangs to young families, the boardwalk remains the pinnacle of the myrtle beach oceanfront scene, and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year for its bevy of shops, restaurants, arcades, bars, and of course, its wide stretches of endless ocean views.

myrtle beach skywheel


it's impossible for oceanfront beach-goers to miss myrtle beaches' literal top attraction, the myrtle beach skywheel. the nearly 190' tall ferris wheel is a relatively new beachside attraction, but is easily one of the grand strand's biggest and brightest sites, with an impressive façade that really dazzles at night, when the circular wheel and spokes are lit up in an array of splashing, flashing colors.

huntington beach state park


the huntington beach state park, located adjacent to the acclaimed brookgreen gardens, is a secluded paradise which combines miles of waterfront views with pristine beaches, towering palmettos and maritime forests, and the almost-spooky and unoccupied ancient retreat that once belonged to one of the grand strand's most famous citizens.

surfside beach fishing pier


the pier, which is the local hotspot for big-name catches and seasonal tasty trophies to take home and enjoy over a grill, has a long legacy of attracting neighboring myrtle beach visitors to this smaller, and less developed region, and is the home base for hours of vacation fun which includes great fishing, good eats, and incredible atlantic views. a fantastic spot for inspiring photos and memorable strolls, and an even better locale to reel in the big one, the surfside fishing pier is a town icon that brings vacationers bank to surfside beach after year.

the 10 best beach canopies & umbrellas for 2025


beach canopies and umbrellas create shade, lower ambient temperatures and block uv rays on hot, sunny summer days. sitting under the canopy of a quality beach umbrella can make the difference between comfort and sweltering. when choosing an umbrella, we look for durability, wind ratings, weight and size.








the 11 best beach toys for summer 2025


here is a list of some of our favorite beach toys for kiddos. we gravitate to unique, high-quality toys that inspire creativity. some of these toys are classics, and some add a twist.








surfside beach


visitors who want to be close to all the action of the grand strand, but stay in a relatively quieter community, will fall in love with surfside beach. this small beach town located just south of myrtle beach, and located only 8 miles from the myrtle beach international airport, is a great representative sample of all the grand attractions, lodging options, amenities and activities that its more populated neighbors have to offer, but with the relaxed atmosphere of a smaller beach getaway.







myrtle beach visitors certainly never have to worry about finding things to do. this southern vacation paradise has been hailed as one of the biggest vacation destinations on the eastern seaboard, and the collection of beachside towns that make up the "grand strand," specifically myrtle beach, north myrtle beach, murrells inlet, surfside beach, and garden city, welcome millions of visitors every year for the white sand beaches and the overwhelming atmosphere of endless fun.

of all of these communities, myrtle beach is certainly the largest and most recognized, and with hundreds of restaurants, shops and plazas, entertainment options, and well over 100 golf courses, it's no wonder that this beach town has such worldwide notoriety. a vacation destination that can accommodate all groups, from families to spring breakers, or bikers to golfers, this coastal town literally has something for everyone and is a paradise for visitors who want to stay busy, and enjoy endless avenues of things to do, both on and off the golden south carolina shoreline.

many visitors travelling along the main highway 17 bypass or the business 17 beach road, both of which are well stocked with bright colored shops, massive entertainment venues, and restaurants, may find it hard to believe that this always-busy beach town was ever unpopulated. 

surprisingly, however, while other coastal carolina communities like charleston, georgetown and wilmington, nc were already established by the civil war, myrtle beach was relatively deserted until the turn of the 20th century. early colonization efforts were half-heartedly attempted, but tragedies and the hardships of living so close to the atlantic ocean eventually shut all efforts down. for example, the withers family, a local family who received land grants to settle the area in the late 1700s, was all but wiped out when an 1822 hurricane ravaged the area, drowning 18 people in their home.

this all changed when the burroughs and collins company of conway, sc purchased most of the withers' coastal land in 1881, and established "new town" in the early 1900s. the name "new town" would later be changed to "withers" when the first us post office was established, and then finally "myrtle beach" when the railroad was extended to serve the area. the burroughs and collins' descendants recognized the potential of myrtle beach, and spend the first half of the 20th century building the town into a tourist destination to rival the more popular new jersey and florida seashore destinations. 

as now iconic businesses and landmarks slowly poured into the area, like the still standing gay dolphin gift shop or the "fun plaza," formerly sloppy joes in north myrtle beach, more and more visitors began to descend on the beaches. military soldiers stationed in the region or on leave began to visit the beaches with gusto in the 1940s, and by the 1950s, myrtle beach was welcoming thousands of young families, groups of adults and college kids, fishermen who flocked to the local piers like the longstanding cherry grove pier, and everyday curious vacationers who wanted to see what all the fuss is about. 

while this early era is, for the most part, long gone, visitors can still revisit the original myrtle beach at a number of dance halls that celebrate the original beach music and shag-dancing scene. in fact, a 1980s movie dedicated to this period of myrtle beach, named "shag" is still a cult favorite among long-time southern vacationers.

today, of course, myrtle beach is a vacationing mecca, with countless things to do around every beach block. the newly built boardwalk in the heart of the town is a great place for newcomers to get their feet wet in the shore side scene, as the 1+ mile wooden walkway borders both the beaches and the heart of the oceanside business district. bordering amusement parks, shops, restaurants, and arcades, a visitor could easily spend a full vacation just strolling along the boardwalk and soaking up the different things to do.

golf, arguably the state sport of south carolina, is another popular pastime and the region has over 100 golf courses and more than 40 mini golf courses to challenge players of all abilities and ages. with a number of courses ranked among the world's best, golfing vacations at local resorts or adjacent vacation rental communities are popular among myrtle beach's guests, and the scenic lowcountry courses are sure to challenge and delight any active vacationer.

shopping is another favorite local "sport," and myrtle beach is home to hundreds of boutiques, souvenir shops, and plazas that can cater to bargain hunters and elite treasure hunter alike. shopping centers like the market commons in myrtle beach, broadway at the beach, magnolia town center, and the coastal grand mall feature hundreds of upscale and nationally recognized name brand stores, while outlet centers and discount finds, like the tanger outlet mall or the waccamaw factory shoppes feature oodles of designer duds at a steep discount. like myrtle beach's other big beachside and golf attractions, it's not unusual for die-hard shopper to spend a full vacation scoping out the scene, and still be unable to check out every desirable coastal boutique or designer outlet in the area.

spring breakers and night owls recognize myrtle beach as a great place to forego the sleep and stay out late, and there are plenty of bars and clubs located along the main drag of the boardwalk, and along the oceanfront, to explore. with live music, djs, karaoke, and world famous drinks, (watch out for the "fish bowl"), vacationing patrons who like the party scene will find plenty of reasons to enjoy the nightlife. 

there are also hundreds of restaurants, ranging from classic beachside snack shops to elite fine dining establishments that are world-ranked, and everything in between. myrtle beach is arguably most famous for its large selection of buffets, and it's not unusual for visitors to spot dozens of marquis and hand painted signs boasting over 100 menu items at an expansive, all-you-can-eat establishment.

accommodation options are just as varied, ranging from high rise oceanfront hotels to secluded vacation homes, and visitors will find thousands of options for any sized party, or for any length of stay.

at first glance, myrtle beach clearly seems like the pinnacle of excess, but visitors who crave a quieter scene will find respites amidst the action as well. neighboring towns like murrells inlet, pawleys island and surfside beach are quieter versions of this big destination along the grand strand, while local natural attractions, like the brookgreen gardens, central park, inlet point plantation stables, and mclean park, give myrtle beach and north myrtle beach a serene break from the boisterous beachfront activity.
from waterparks to oceanfront ferris wheels, biker bars to boutiques, and fishing piers to fine dining, there is clearly no stone  or seashell uncovered when it comes to entertainment in myrtle beach. recognized as the south's mecca for a whirlwind of beach fun and activity, "america's favorite beach" is always open for longtime fans and curious newcomers alike. pick an adventure, or sample everything this town has to offer, and enjoy a beach week that's as active and entertaining as any destination along the east coast.
