welcome to island life
the leading community and
      portal site in the channel islands





launched in december 2000, we
                      were the leading community site and portal in the
                      channel islands at that time with visitors from all over the world, particularly those with
                      channel island connections.
use the navigation buttons on the
                      left to first choose the home page of each island and then move to the sub menus for
                      further pages covering all aspects of island life.
                      the navigation buttons at the top are more general subjects, not specific to any particular
                      island. the navigation line at the top of each
                      page shows where you are in the
                      website. 
the site brought together information
                      about all the channel islands for residents and tourists
                      alike. we used to receive
                      contributions from readers to help keep the content up to date, particularly in the
                      community sections.
as social media has since taken
                      over, we are not updating the site but hope that much of the history contained therein
                      will be useful.
