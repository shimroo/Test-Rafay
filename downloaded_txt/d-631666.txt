cleaning has always been a top priority at the nest but we kicked that into high gear in march 2020. every linen including all blankets and bed covers are washed in hot water with a hospital grade disinfectant (they have always been washed-now we are using hospital grade disinfectants also). all surfaces including all remotes, switches, light pulls, drawer, keys and door handles are wiped down with the same disinfectant.  please go to our facebook page to see pictures and videos of our cleaning.  we are regularly steam cleaning the carpet with a super heated disinfectant formula - cavicide.   we are also using vionex hospital grade disinfectant to use super heat and fog the entire nest after every visit.  lysol, clorox wipes and hand sanitizer are provided for use in the nest for your stay. (provided we can find it!)
