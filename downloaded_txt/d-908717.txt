in the early 1800's jake and sam hawken formed a family partnership as gun-makers in st. louis and began producing their soon to be famous
              "hawken rifle"...
                ...in 1990 a new and equally great period of the "hawken" story began. greg roberts and claudette greene purchased "the hawken shop®" to
              preserve this valued part of americana. once again the classic
              "hawken" has returned. the hawken shop® is also the retail outlet for all other dayton traister inc products including dayton traister triggers and safeties
              and varner tang sights.
