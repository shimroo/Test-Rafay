2nd annual jeepers rally for life a big success





last saturday, a large number of jeepers gathered at erwin's chrysler jeep in troy, ohio and paraded to the miami county fairgrounds to participate in the relay for life jeep rally. participants drove their jeeps through the "playground" in front of the grandstand. we had rocks to climb, obstacles, hills, mud and other fun jeep things to conquer. after the rally at the fairgrounds, the jeeps returned to erwin's for lunch, a presentation by the american cancer society on services available locally, jeep games, a dj and raffle items. this year many more jeepers showed up in part due to the support of erwin's, miami county fairgrounds, three jeep clubs (sidney's buckeye jeepers, dayton's muddy buddy's and indiana's fat boys) and many other sponsors and vendors . one of the jeep club members said, "jeepers get to help and to learn from people who are fighting the battle against cancer and to remember those that have lost the battle. when relayers watch a jeep do something seemingly impossible, in some small way it could help them face some of their seemingly impossible obstacles."please don't miss next years event if you were unable to attend! to learn more: http://www.jeeprallyforlife.com/i am looking for pictures from the event as i forgot my camera. send to: klkittel@hotmail.comthanks go out to sidney daily news for a large part of the content of this article.

motorized couch





 last year i was quite amazed by the mobile picnic table, so for gravelrama 37 we decided to build a motorized couch just to have some fun. it was a great success and proved very useful for fetching ice and other things thanks to the pickup bed attached to the rear. a coffee table on the front provides a nice place to rest your feet and favorite beverage.technical specs: built on a toro groundmaster zero turn lawnmower, 12hp kohler power, electric start, 2 hydros on the front, 1 cable activated crazy wheel in the rear. top speed is about 10 mph unless you are sitting on the outside seat during a zero tun manuver, then things get really hoppin!this couch can safley support 3 people 250 lbs ++ it has 2 gears forward and 1 reverse, running ligts were added during the event so that we would comply with the rules for golf carts and quads operating after dark. look for more pictures of it in sand times magazine, it should be on shelves soon.
