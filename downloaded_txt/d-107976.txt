introduction


      below is the complete list of andersenâs 168 tales,
      in the chronological order of their original publication. title
      variations and danish equivalents may be found in the cross reference.
    

      andersenâs tale âdanish popular legendsâ was
      first published in the riverside magazine for young people, vol.
      iv, pp. 470-474, new york, october 1870. it has never been published in
      denmark. the hypertext is based on an etext found in the andersen homepage of the
      danish national literary archive.
    

      it may be somewhat surprising to learn that a number of andersenâs tales
      were published in america even before being published in andersenâs
      native denmark. according to jean hersholtâs introduction to the
      andersen-scudder letters, university of california press, 1949, ten
      tales were published by horace elisha scudder, andersenâs american
      editor, publisher and translator, in the above mentioned magazine,
      in the years 1868-1870. after the magazine closed down, scudder
      published four other tales, in the years 1871-1873, in scribnerâs
      monthly, an illustrated magazine for the people: âlucky peerâ (in four installments), âthe great sea-serpentâ, âthe
      gardener and the manorâ, and âthe flea and the
      professorâ. the hypertext of these four tales is based on the images
      found in the making of
      america collection of cornell university library.
    

      127 more tales are given in a hypertext rendition of mrs. paullâs
      nineteenth century translation, now in the public
      domain. four more tales, contributed by mike w. perry and
      marked by a (*), are digitized from fairy tales and other stories by
      hans christian andersen, revised and partly re-translated by w.a. and
      j. k. craigie, oxford univ. press, london, 1914. mike also contributed
      the three tales marked by (**), from wonder stories told for
      children, houghton mifflin, boston, 1900. the remaining 29 tales are
      given in title only, using jean hersholtâs translation, published in
      three volumes in 1942-49 by the heritage press, and now
      collectorsâ items.
    

      the 30 most popular tales are marked by a . 30 more tales, which elias bredsdorff,
      in his book hans
      christian andersen: the story of his life and work: 1805-75,
      published in 1975 by phaidon press and republished in 1994 by
      noonday press, considers most characteristic and representative,

      complete hans christian andersen fairy tales, edited by lily

about the artwork


      andersenâs tales in this collection are illustrated by the âofficialâ
      andersen illustrators, i. e., the danish artists chosen by andersen to
      illustrate the collected danish editions of his tales: the naval officer
      lieutenant vilhelm pedersen (1820-59), who illustrated the 1849 edition
      (45 tales, 125 illustrations) and continued to illustrate andersenâs work
      for the next ten years, and lorenz frã¸lich (1820-1908), who illustrated
      andersenâs work between 1867 and 1874. see also the chapter âhans
      christian andersen and his illustratorsâ, in fairy
      tales from hans christian andersenâa classic illustrated edition,

      the background of these pages is reproduced
      from a paper cutting made by andersen himself. elias bredsdorff explains:
    

      âthe items on the pierrotâs tray... represent
      some of the stages in andersenâs life: his 
      birthplace in odense, the old grammar school in slagelse, the windmill man (a fairy-tale motif), saint canuteâs
      church in odense, and the ugly duckling
      transformed into a swan.â
    

      johan de mylius, in his book h.
      c. andersen paper cuts, aschehoug dansk forlag, 2000,
      elaborates:
    

      â...a frog-like gnome, dancer, or circus performer, his mouth open in a
      shriek. and like mythological atlas, he carries above him visible
      reality, the urban world and a segment of the world of poetry and nature.
      this could be the hidden and infernal side of the artist, whoâbrought to
      his knees by normalcyâpresents on a tray the side of realty that we know
      and wish and acknowledge. how long can he hold it? when will it tip
      over?â

      amazing paper cuttings of hans christian andersen by beth wagner brust, ticknor &

      in 2 march 2005, the same paper cutting appeared on a danish stamp issued
      for andersenâs bicentennial, to represent hans christian andersen the
      artist.

then her husband asked, âfrom whence hast thou all at once derived
      such strength and comforting faith?â
      and as she kissed him and her children, she said, âit came from god,
      through my child in the grave.â
