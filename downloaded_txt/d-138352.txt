 humphrys genealogy 



the genealogy site of mark humphrys.

genealogies  of   families 
connected to me or to my wife.

mostly  in ireland, england and scotland,
though with  some   branches around the world.

includes  
a number of famous families.
 





   over 2,600 public web pages.
   dense with images, text and links. containing over 113,000 links.
   over  34,000  public  images. 
   maybe over 10,000 a4 pages  if ever printed out.

my study in 2023.



  


 introduction 


i have been researching my family tree since 1983,
and my wife's family tree since 1995.


i have
   over  2,600 public web  pages
 of original research on 
 local and family history
in ireland, england and scotland.
 



this research is driven by personal criteria
- by who is related to me or to my wife
- so   it is hard to summarise exactly what is here.


the detail also varies.

some families i cover in enormous detail.

other families i merely sketch since they are covered by others elsewhere.
 

(some lines here  connect to     landed,      titled and royal families.)
 

  







i started a website in 1994,
but i think    i did not start putting genealogy onto it until 
1995.


there   are  surviving 
 archive.org copies
of my site  from 1999.
(there are no earlier archive.org copies
because  the    servers  it was on before this  
 blocked spiders.)



  i think my site is  
 
 
   the oldest continuously-running  genealogy site     in  ireland.
 

 

   (paddy waldron's    site
is older, 
but  took a break.)

 
 



  



   my family tree 





my  connection  with the world family tree.

blennerhassett cashel,
 descendant of edward iii. 










this all began in 1983, as research in motoring history,
when i began to research a series of 
  cars built by my grandfather and others
in ireland in the 1920s and 1930s: 
  the "thomond" motor car.
this led on to researching 
my family tree
in general.



there was a vast amount of family history material to start with
because so many of my family
 were involved in the irish revolution of 1916-23.

family members were arrested,
jailed,  on hunger-strike,
active in underground government,
shot,
and even killed.

it is a cliché in ireland that one's ancestors were in the gpo in
the rising in 1916,
but my grandfather
 dick humphreys  did fight in the gpo in 1916,
and his uncle  "the o'rahilly", one of the leaders of the rebellion,
was the only leader to be killed in action (the others were executed).


i could summarise my family as almost archetypal  catholics made good in the 19th century in ireland
- after the ending of the repressive laws against catholics,
when a vast body of irish catholics slowly began to work their way up from nothing
 through trade, farming and business,
 to form the middle class of the emerging state at the start of the 20th century.
the 
 o'maras,
 o'rahillys and
 flanagans
all rose like this over the course of the 19th century.
indeed, the writer  kate o'brien 
used the o'maras as the archetypal example of such a family.

 my great-great-grandfather stephen o'mara
was a parnellite mp.

 my great-grandfather james o'mara,
 home rule mp, sinn fein td,
was a member of the 1st dail   in 1919,

as was my grand-uncle w.t. cosgrave, who
 became the  first prime minister of an independent ireland in 1922.

his son 
liam cosgrave
(my mother's first cousin)
became prime minister of ireland  in  1973.

 my wife's family tree 



     

my wife's best
connection to the world family tree.

 augustus reebkomp,
descendant of edward iii.








i never planned to research
my wife's family tree
as well,
but it was too interesting to resist,
and again, a lot of source material has survived
which i could read.



her family descends from an impossibly romantic story:  
augustus "reebkomp",
the illegitimate son of 
  henry herbert, 10th earl of pembroke 
in england in the 18th century.
reebkomp was the product of an infamous
 elopement in 1762
 that is referred to in the movie
  the madness of king george.
he grew up with his legitimate half-brother (the future 11th earl),
and money came out of the earl's family for him and his descendants
for almost a full hundred years.
through him, my wife descends from most of the great 
 old anglo-irish families of the pale
of the last few hundred years,
which is of particular interest to me.


apart from the above,
her family history can be summarised as 
   merchants and traders in scotland in the 17th and 18th centuries,
who rose to the middle class there
centuries before that was possible in ireland.
indeed, through one line we see a 
slow descent from a great family,
 skene  of skene, aberdeenshire
(as opposed to the sudden and spectacular descent of the illegitimate son above).

 our common family tree 

as you head further back, your lines either peter out,
or else you link up with   millions of other people
in a vast "western family tree".



  

  my wife's  link to the western tree 

since i met my wife i saw she was on the western family tree.
 
 

through  some  gateway ancestors she    has a number of 
  royal descents.

the most recent english  monarch she descends from is
 edward iii.




this is not  that unusual.
my most popular web page  
is my collection of
 	royal descents of famous people,
which shows how much of the population of the west descends
provably from medieval european royalty.


  

 my  link to the western tree 


my story ends in the same place, but it took decades.
for 35 years  i tried to establish our link with the   blennerhassett family of co.kerry.
i was  aware that a gateway to the western family tree lay behind it.

for all  those  years  i was unable to prove our connection.
 
in 2020, this finally  changed.
  dna testing    proved    that   we  descend  from   the 
 blennerhassett baronets branch.





see
 proof of our descent from blennerhassett   
for the proof that we  descend  from   the blennerhassett  baronets  branch.



 i call it as proved  that my ancestor
  george   cashel  (born 1807)
descends   from
robert blennerhassett   (died 1765)
and his wife
frances yielding.
 nothing else explains the dna.
 

that we descend from this family  is proven, 
 but the exact descent is unproven.
 
 
 it remains to prove this from paper, to confirm from paper records 
  what the  dna says must exist.
 
 


this means that i too connect to the world family tree.
 i too   have a  royal descent.
 the most recent monarch i descend  from is
 edward iii.


  

 our common tree 


this means that my wife and i are related.
 
hence three sections: 

my family tree,

my wife's family tree,

and 
 
our common family tree
- the families  we both descend from.




much of this earlier part of my  site,
such as my  sketches of  medieval royalty
and other well-known families,
 is not original research, nor intended to be,
but is merely a kind of extended ancestors chart for  my wife and i.

 genealogy in general 

i have made some  more general contributions to genealogy.
 




 hypertext burke's peerage pedigree format 

i think i was the first to really argue for a hypertext version of the
burke's peerage format
as the ultimate way to draw family trees,
especially  complex interconnected trees.
i think i was the first to highlight the advantage of variable resolution:



 "hypertext indented narrative" pedigree format: adapting the burke's peerage format for the web,
computers in genealogy 7(1):26-46 (mar 2000).

this paper shows how with hypertext
it is  possible, really for the first time in history, to
  draw large family trees  by hand.

quite a strong claim - when people have been drawing family trees
for centuries.
but i  believe hypertext adds something genuinely new
to this ancient debate.



hypertext for 1-name studies v. hypertext for family histories:
a reply to john bending,
computers in genealogy 7(3):121-8 (sept 2000).

royal descents of famous people 



my most popular  page 
is my collection of
 	royal descents of famous people.




 most recent common ancestor of all humans  
 
my 
 	royal descents of famous people
 page  seems to suggest
that almost everyone in the west
descends from charlemagne.

there has been a lot of further recent evidence
 (notably computer simulations)

that this is true,
i.e. 
 that the
 most recent common ancestor of all of humanity
 (or at least all of the west)
may  be not in pre-history
but actually in historical times.


this new theory is explained at my popular
  common  ancestors of all humans
page.




see my article:
 ryan tubridy descends from brian boru. and so do you.

 prominent families 


my most useful original contributions
- families of universal interest, that are done in detail - are:

 
 the famous and eccentric 
flanagans of dublin
 the prominent
o'mara family of limerick city
 the revolutionary
o'rahillys of co.kerry and dublin

 blennerhassett of co.kerry

 the viscounts  fitzwilliam of dublin

 herbert, earls of pembroke, 
of wilton house, wiltshire

the holy grail of my genealogy research: 
35 years i spent 
  trying to
establish  the blennerhassett descent 
implied
in the notes of my grand-aunt above.


in 2020 i finally proved it. 




sometimes things are easier.
from this 
single sheet found in an old tin box
could be   reconstructed and corroborated
a   descent of one of my wife's ancestors
from the great scottish family of skene,
 leading ultimately to a royal descent. 







 "i spent the whole evening reading over a parcel of my own letters, addressed to my sisters
which they fancied worth preserving.
what a strange creature is man, more strange still  woman!
i am as different to what i was 15 years ago,
as i am now to an entire stranger.
my letters must have been amusing at the time they were written
but the subjects were so personal that now when time has shown me those persons in a different
point of view, and changed the whole face of things,
they appeared to me highly ridiculous,
and my own compositions not worth reading again.
i threw the whole bundle into the fire" 

-  diary of ann gibbon, sun 23rd jan 1820.



"one happy day in my life"

-  charles morris, 1891.

i have    spent   a great deal  of  time and money on this research.  
  research     involves   travel     and  many    expenses. 
  some research   "things to do"  
are not done  for years, because  i do not  have the money to do them.
