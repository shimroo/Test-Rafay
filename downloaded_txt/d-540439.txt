we are huguenot descendants














the huguenot society of south carolina was established in 1885 to preserve the memory of the huguenots who left france prior to the promulgation of the edict of toleration, november 28, 1787. today, the society has nearly 2,000 members who are descendants of those huguenots.



rather than forsake their faith, the huguenots left their homes, families and the life they knew in search of a place where they could worship and live freely.we celebrate their courage by preserving and sharing their story because we believe that to know who you are, you need to know who you were.
