lawrie 
    alexander opened british sportscar center in january, 1994, after being 
    in the british car repair and restoration business in southern california 
    since 1976. in the following 10 years, bsc restored dozens of cars for 
    people from all over the country, as well as establishing a large clientele 
    of very satisfied service and repair customers. after undergoing a double 
    coronary bypass in october, 2004, lawrie was unable to continue business at 
    its previous hectic pace so he now concentrates on the cars that were his 
    first passion: t-series and older mgs (though an occasional nice mga or 
    early mgb will surely cross the threshold from time to time!). bsc still sells new and used parts, and offers a bench 
    rebuilding service for engines, gearboxes and carburetors for all models of 
    mg. lawrie also maintains his contacts for buying and selling british sports 
    cars.
