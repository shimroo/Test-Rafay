make a donation.mission and ministry happens because of generous support from our congregation and community partners. when you make a donation to blair road united methodist church, you are helping to change lives. whether through book bags of love (food for elementary school children), servant's heart (aid for local residents who are in need), general missions (help locally and globally), special offerings (like christmas eve or united methodist committee on relief), our general fund (which covers every need the church has), and other offerings, we strive to honor god and love our world through our giving. thank you for partnering with us!
