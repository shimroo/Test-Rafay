	 2009 is here
	 
    


here we are, 16 days into 2009. we received very few scarves during the holiday season. though we did get a nice shipment from one person who sent some nice crocheted scarves, but before i get you totally confused, these were not one of our stitchers. i think one or two of our stitches sent scarves.i'm nearly done with the mini-mochi scarf. by the way, the yarn is now available through yarn market and jimmy beans wool one site was a few cents cheaper, but i didn't check shipping costs on either. this yarn is so very soft. the pattern is easy;using two balls of yarn, pull from the outside of one and the inside of the other. i used a cable cast on and cast on 46 stitches. slip the first stitch purlwise, then purl 1, knit one across. complete two rows with the first ball of yarn then use the second ball for the next two rows. when you switch colors, allow the color you're dropping to lay to the left, pull up the yarn you're picking up slip the first stitch then using the new yarn purl the second stitch. this is a picture when it was less than half done, but the colors just contine to make an amazing scarf. it's currently about 4' long, and i think i have enough yarn to do another 6 inches or so.may 2009 be kind to you all. i hope you're all busy knitting lots of wonderful projects.

	 here and there cables!
	 
    


hi all - here's my version on here and there cables in tatamy tweed worsted (40% cotton, 60% acrylic), oatmeal.  i removed 1 repeat to make it a bit skinnier, but otherwise, used the pattern as written.  it's a very easy pattern to memorize.  it's thick and cushy.  i made it for a very good friend for her birthday!labels: here and there cables

	 vintage velvet
	 
    


i've owned scarf style for a long time and i've been reading this blog for over a year now. i've admired the beautiful scarves i've seen here and finally got around to making the vintage velvet scarf for myself.i found the muench touch me at a lys going out of business sale and couldn't resist particularly since the color is one of my favorites. although i was really nervous about washing this scarf in hot water i couldn't be happier with the result. now for the misty garden i've been thinking about for a year plus.http://tealsworld.blogspot.com/labels: vintage velvet

still working on ene. from scarf style: innovative to traditional, 31 inspirational styles to knit and crochet . great patterns all around in that book.i'm through the second pass on chart 3. fortunately, this shawl gets smaller as she goes. the color in this picture is pretty true to the yarn color. it's a gift for helen. i'm a little late on it. though i do try to get thru at least two rows a night....most nights i make it.i am finally enjoying knitting ene. i was having a hard time with the center stitch, but finally got a handle on how it works on the row.i hope to have this done in the next few weeks and blocked. i'll post pics here and on ravelry when done.pattern: ene, "scarf style: innovative to traditional, 31 inspirational styles to knit and crochet"yarn: baruffa cashwool, doubledneedle size: too lazy to go lookcolor: same issue as abovelabels: ene's scarf
