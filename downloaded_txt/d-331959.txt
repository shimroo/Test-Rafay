the birthplace of american ranching® 
							









the king ranch legacyin 1853, captain richard king purchased a creek-fed oasis in the wild horse desert of south texas, sparking generations of integrity, preservation, and innovation.
king ranch now covers 825,000 acres—more land than the state of rhode island. over the course of over 160 years, king ranch led some of the first cattle drives, developed the santa gertrudis and santa cruz breeds of cattle, bred the finest quarter horses, and produced champion thoroughbreds—all under its iconic running w® brand.
today’s king ranch is a major agribusiness with interests in cattle ranching, farming (citrus, cotton, grain, sugar cane, and turfgrass), luxury retail goods, and recreational hunting.
king ranch continues to foster a culture of uncompromising quality, stewardship, and authenticity—a true testament to captain king’s integrity and commitment to the land.explore king ranch
