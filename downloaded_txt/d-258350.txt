about the children’s medical group
the children’s medical group has a long and distinguished history of caring for the region’s children and utilizes evidence-based care in the treatment of all of our patients. from birth through college age, we offer a comprehensive and well rounded medical service for children. we pride ourselves on a tradition of excellence, accessibility and caring and look forward to establishing a physician-parent partnership with you.
our physicians and pediatric nurse practitioners, having trained and in some cases taught at many of the country’s finest medical institutions, offer a broad and diverse pediatric experience which is enhanced by our individual subspecialty interests.




a lifetime of good health starts here!
from immunizations to emergencies, and tips and solutions for addressing today’s health issues, like childhood obesity, we’re here to take care of your kids. your children come first – that’s our mission.
with offices in dutchess, orange and ulster counties, we are able to offer well-care visits, same-day sick visits, evening, weekend and holiday availability, as well as complete in-office lab services.
our professional team of board certified pediatricians and highly experienced certified pediatric nurse practitioners provide superior care and a higher standard of excellence – with compassion. we aim to earn your trust every day. perhaps that’s why our group has been recognized by the national committee on quality assurance (ncqa).
