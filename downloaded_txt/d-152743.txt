plagiarism
ellen white's books/testimonies contain a large amount of material mrs. white and her group of college educated secretaries plagiarized from non-inspired authors. she had a library of 1200 books to copy from. ellen white did not give credit for her sources, while she led her followers to believe the material she wrote came from the throne of god. 


"in these letters which i write, in the testimonies i bear, i am presenting to you that which the lord has presented to me. i do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my own ideas. they are what god has opened before me in vision--the precious rays of light shining from the throne." testimonies for the church vol. 5 (1882-1889), page 67. see the white lie by walter rea under books.
