what we do









slate & quartzite




											slate is a metamorphic rock that is dense, strong, acid resistant and non-absorptive.



										







limestone

limestone is a common, chemical sedimentary rock formed primarily from calcium carbonate.



										







sandstone

sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) mineral particles or rock fragments. 
										







marble

marble is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone is subjected to the heat and pressure of metamorphism. 



										







stone veneer

it is a revolutionary new and most exciting surfacing product, created by chemically extracting raw material from actual quarried slate



										







garden ornaments & artifacts

our collection of garden ornaments can be used for garden, landscape, and park enhancement and decoration.
