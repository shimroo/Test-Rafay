have 
                                you recently lost your job?  find your unemployment office here



if 
                                so, you may be eligible to receive state unemployment 
                                compensation from your unemployment office. the purpose of unemployment 
                                insurance is to provide workers, who are unemployed 
                                through no fault of their own, with monetary payments 
                                for a specific period of time (usually 6 months) 
                                or until you find a new job. 


                                to be eligible for benefits, you must meet your 
                                state's requirements for wages earned and for 
                                a certain period of time. this is referred to 
                                as your base period. in other words, you must 
                                have been substantially employed, as required 
                                by your states laws. but even if you didn't work 
                                for consecutive weeks, for the same employer, 
                                or in the same state, you may still be eligible 
                                to collect benefits from your unemployment office. the state will determine 
                                your wages earned and asses what your weekly benefit 
                                amount will be. the amount you'll receive varies 
                                widely by state.
