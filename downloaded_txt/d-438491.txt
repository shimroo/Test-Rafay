if you appreciate surrounding yourself with fine things, consider acquiring your furniture as you would acquire your art . . . from a gallery.calderwood gallery is an international resource for original french art deco and art nouveau furniture and objects created from 1900-1950. this is furniture that was born in the mind’s eye of the leading artists, designers, and architects expressing their ideas in furniture and decoration.like fine art, these works were produced either on commission or in small editions through the combined talents of the designers and their master craftsmen - exact in their making and sensitive to the fine materials from which they were made.rare and exotic tropical hardwoods such as amboyna, african mahogany, and macassar ebony were often hallmarks of french art deco. and equally precious as these exotic woods were the decorative techniques used in creating the pieces. marquetry designs, materials such as parchment, shagreen, mother-of-pearl, silver, and hand chiseled gilt bronze add to the luxury and value.and at calderwood gallery each piece is carefully and correctly restored to its original state, in the refinishing studio, using the 300-year french tradition. for home or office, the classic originals from calderwood gallery are statement pieces. as works of art they are sublime. each original period piece is scholarly-curated, signed, documented, or just  beautiful design.
