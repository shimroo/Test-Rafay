and yes, i believe our republic and liberty is in danger. not in a "doomsday tomorrow! run for your lives!" sort of way. the danger lies, rather, in giving up our birthright for a pot of stew and some bread.

the delcaration of independence





"prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed."

memorial day... we remember





we are all here today because of the soldiers who went where no one should have had to go. "thank you" is a small quiet word and seems inadequate; but we offer it humbly and honestly. we promise to do everything we can to protect the blessings you've secured for us. rest in peace now, and let us keep watch over you.trace adkins | myspace music videos

let me make this clear as a bell...





to my family, friends, physicians, lawyer & others whom it may concern:death is as much a reality as birth, growth, maturity, and old age. death is the one certainty of life. if the time comes when i can no longer take part in decisions for my own future, let this statement stand as an expression of my wishes and directions, while i am still of sound mind.if at such a time the situation should arise in which there is no reasonable expectation of my recovery from extreme physical or mental disability, i direct that i be allowed to die and not be kept alive by medications, artificial means or "heroic measures." i do, however, ask that medication be mercifully administered to me to alleviate suffering even though this may shorten my remaining life.this statement is made after careful consideration and is in accordance with my strong convictions and beliefs. i want the wishes and directions here expressed carried out to the extent permitted by law. insofar as they are not legally enforceable, i hope that those to whom this will is addressed will regard themselves as morally bound by these provisions.kevin palmerthis is merely a statement of my beliefs and wishes. it is not a legal document nor shall it replace or supersede the actual legal documents i have legally executed including a living will and a health care power of attorney.

and the heads start rolling





one incumbent down... sen. bob bennett (r-ut)...bennett was a distant third in the second round of voting among nearly 3,500 delegates, netting about 27 percent of the vote.wiping away tears, bennett called the political atmosphere "toxic" and said it's, "clear some of the votes i've cast have added to that toxic environment, looking back with one or two minor exceptions, i wouldn't cast any any differently, even if i knew it would cost me my career."the three-term senator was targeted by tea party activists and other groups for supporting the first traunch of tarp, or troubled assets relief program.bennett, 76, is the first incumbent to lose his seat in washington this year.fyi: "toxic" is career politicalese for "sour grapes". enjoy your retirement bob. like i've said, republicans have as much to fear this year as democrats.

excuse me? what did you say achmed?





excerpt: sweden - muslim community fears violence after attack on elderly couple.an elderly couple was attacked last monday when trying to park their car in the swedish town of landskrona.the couple were trying to park, but another car was in their way. they honked and parked. but the young man (23) in the other car rolled down his window and asked why they honked. an altercation started. the young man became so upset, he threw the car door on the 71 year old man, sven, who fell down. the young man then started beating the 71 year old.the older man's 78 year old wife, inger, tried to intervene, but was punched in the face and fainted.the younger man fled in his car. the elderly couple were brought to the hospital. the 71 year was in shock and had injuries to his face and back. the 78 year old was brought to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. she died of her injuries wednesday.i'm sorry? i don't think i heard that correctly? they fear violence? can someone name me the last attack on an elderly muslim couple parking their car? what about a muslim cartoonist having his home invaded by an angry christian or jew wielding an axe because he was upset at a political cartoon? when was the last muslim filmmaker stabbed to death in the street for making a movie critical of the amish or lutherans? muslims constantly wail about their fear of backlash (over their own acts mind you) yet seem to be the only ones actually perpetrating the sort of violence they claim they're afraid of experiencing. assholes.

the day between is significant because it exists..."not its number in the series, but its place, bears its significance as that day between the days which speaks solely neither of the cross nor of the resurrection, but simultaneously remembers the one and awaits the other, and guarantees that neither will be heard, or thought about, or lived, without the other." ~ alan e. lewis

misguided sense of loyalty?





after rising to fame on mccain's coattails, palin tries to save his political lifetwo years ago, john mccain transformed sarah palin overnight from an obscure first-term alaska governor into a national celebrity when he picked her as his vice presidential running mate.now palin is repaying the favor, putting her prestige on the line in an effort to help the four-term arizona senator overcome his toughest re-election challenge ever.the two will campaign together friday for the first time since they lost the presidential race in 2008.unfortunately she probably will be able to help mccain't get back to the senate. sarah, sarah, sarah... wrong, wrong, wrong... i don't care if he's acting like a new pentecostal convert to conservatism post health care reform. mccain (of campaign finance reform, amnesty, and the gang of 14) needs to go, go, go...

in peace or in sorrow





"it is well with my soul" is a very influential hymn penned by hymnist horatio spafford and composed by philip bliss.this hymn was written after several traumatic events in spafford's life. the first was the death of his only son in 1871, shortly followed by the great chicago fire which ruined him financially (he had been a successful lawyer). then in 1873, he had planned to travel to europe with his family on the s.s. ville du havre, but sent the family ahead while he was delayed on business concerning zoning problems following the great chicago fire. while crossing the atlantic, the ship sank rapidly after a collision with a sailing ship, the loch earn, and all four of spafford's daughters died. his wife anna survived and sent him the now famous telegram, "saved alone." shortly afterwards, as spafford traveled to meet his grieving wife, he was inspired to write these words as his ship passed near where his daughters had died.bliss called his tune ville du havre, from the name of the stricken vessel.the spaffords later had three more children, one of whom (a son) died in infancy. in 1881 the spaffords, including baby bertha and newborn grace, set sail for israel. the spaffords moved to jerusalem and helped found a group called the american colony; its mission was to serve the poor. the colony later became the subject of the nobel prize winning jerusalem, by swedish novelist selma lagerlöf.

barry: you might want to screen your people props a little better...





first, i offer my prayers for a complete and full recovery for natoma canfield. but it would be remiss not to mention (as the president opted not too) that she is in the hospital getting the treatment she needs and is all but certain to get financial assistance through the hospital or charity group and/or medicaid. and the cleveland clinic is not going to force her to pay or die, nor choose between her home or medical treatment.natoma canfield, the cancer-stricken woman who has become a centerpiece of president obama's push for health care reform, will not lose her home over her medical bills and will probably qualify for financial aid, a top official at the cleveland medical center treating her told foxnews.com.  [note: i made a quick search of the other major news outlets and it doesn't appear any of them are eager to knock off obama's halo on this story ~ kevin]though canfield's sister connie anderson said her sibling is afraid she’ll lose her house and obama warned at an ohio rally monday that the patient is “racked with worry” about the cost of tests and treatment, she is already being screened for financial help.lyman sornberger, executive director of patient financial services at the cleveland clinic, said “all indications” at the outset are that she will be considered for assistance.“she may be eligible for state medicaid … and/or she will be eligible for charity (care) of some form or type. … in my personal opinion, she will be eligible for something,” he said, adding that canfield should not be worried about losing her home.“cleveland clinic will not put a lien on her home,” he said. [note: cleveland clinic is a not for profit hospital, but no hospital will turn you away for inability to pay in an emergency situation and in a case like natoma's every hospital will work with you to find financial aid or charity or get you on medicade. ~ kevin]mr. president, you might want to ask your staff (such as it is) to screen these people a little better before you stir the pot at these rallies. i know, i know the only thing that matters is that the story sounds good. alright then... go for it.via ace of spades hq

nobody panics when things go "according to plan." even if the plan is horrifying! ~ the joker





conservative values

conservative: kept within sensible limits, not excessive, discreet, heedful of consequences, reasonable, and restrained.american exceptionalism: the united states is an exceptional nation. no other country in the history of the world has done more to secure liberty and honor god-given rights of individuals. our government is uniquely of, by, and for the people, not the other way around.we are one people: all of america's citizens can enjoy the rights and freedoms of our country without diminishing the rights of others. there can be honest differences of opinion and such differences result in opponents, not enemies.limited government and personal freedom: thomas jefferson was correct when he wrote: "that government is best which governs least." public servants must be held accountable to the highest standards of ethical conduct. government should be limited to the powers delegated it by the constitution. beyond these powers, as government grows, individual freedom shrinks and the economy suffers. high taxes, runaway government spending, and over-regulation of business and farming punish initiative and stifle economic growth. your property is yours and you have the basic right to make use of it without unreasonable government restrictions.reassertion of 10th amendment sovereignty: the 10th amendment to the united states constitution guarantees to the states and their people all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the constitution of the united states.  the united states constitution defines the total scope of federal power as being that specifically granted by the united states constitution and no more. the federal government was created by the states and their people specifically to be an agent of the states and their people. the federal government, as our agent, should be discouraged from imposing certain restrictive mandates or exercising powers that are beyond the scope of those constitutionally delegated.family is the foundation of the republic: family and the values it fosters are the foundation of american society and their preservation is essential to our nation's continued success.the supreme court: the purpose of the supreme court is to determine whether laws are in keeping with the constitutionally limited powers delegated the government. the supreme court is not to rule based on any other standard than that of a strict interpretation of the united states constitution.individual rights: the united states were founded on the fundamental principle that individuals have certain rights and freedoms which cannot be infringed upon and may be restricted only to the degree necessary to preserve the rights of others. the subjugation of individual rights in favor of groups rights is unconstitutional and has always lead to the trampling of individual freedom.individual responsibility: individuals are responsible for their actions and the consequences. it is not government's place to save individuals from their mistakes. this kind of government intervention only encourages irresponsible behavior and impinges on others' rights. with freedom comes responsibility and that individuals must take personal responsibility for their own actions and our criminal justice system must be based on this idea.religious freedom: americans should be free to practice religion how they please. christianity has been a positive force in our society. government should not overreach its powers to discriminate against any religious group. government has no right to suppress prayers nor expressions of faith in public schools.respect for life: life is sacred and is to be defended. this includes the most vulnerable among us, the unborn. ronald reagan was correct when he wrote: "make no mistake, abortion-on-demand is not a right granted by the constitution. we cannot diminish the value of one category of human life -- the unborn -- without diminishing the value of all human life."right to bear arms: the right to own a gun is recognized specifically in the constitution, yet it is constantly under attack legislatively and legally. the right to own firearms is important to the safety and security of individuals and a nation.strong military and national defense: a strong military is a necessary deterrent in dangerous world. the u.s. must maintain military superiority to ensure our security. the american military is made up of dedicated and patriotic individuals who deserve this nation's full support. the preservation of our rights and freedoms necessitates a strong national defense and the ability of the united states to negotiate with other nations from a position of strength.secure borders: legal immigrants have enriched this country. illegal immigration undermines american sovereignty and weakens national security. the u.s. has a right and obligation to secure it's borders.energy independence: for national security and economic reasons it is time that we as a nation become energy independent by exploiting all our natural resources responsibly while at the same time encouraging energy innovation.educational choice: parents have the right to determine the values with which their children will be raised and to have the widest possible choice among public, private and religious schools and that competition will improve public education.low taxes, free markets, and fiscal constraint: the the money you earn is yours and government in a free society should be given only as much as is needed to perform those limited duties which are delegated to it. government redistribution of income through taxation is not constitutional. individuals have a right to their income and are far better managers of their money than is the government. the free enterprise system is the most effective engine of economic progress and free market solutions improve the economy while upholding individual freedoms.this is written partly by me and compiled partly from here and here.



keep the faith

this is the lesson: never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. ~ winston churchillonly in the western world can a gay man live a free life as himself. hence, the health and strength of the west is fundamental to my survival. ~ usmalewhen my country, into which i had just set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir. it was time for every man to stir. ~ thomas paineit does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men. ~ samuel adamsthere are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong, but the middle is always evil. ~ ayn rand



the american's creed

i believe in the united states of america as a government of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed, a democracy in a republic, a sovereign nation of many sovereign states; a perfect union, one and inseparable; established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which american patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.i therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its constitution, to obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies.~ by william tyler page



quotes i like

a common mistake people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. ~ douglas adamsleftists see everything in terms of black and white - if it has to do with race. when it's good and evil, then everything in their view turns gray....hell is simply one’s freely chosen identity apart from god on a trajectory into infinity. ~ timothy kellerthe allies tried the nazi doctors as war criminals for crimes against humanity for their concentration camp "experiments". obama and eric holder would simply take them to court for malpractice. ~ kevinqcthe liberal paradigm of regulation and license has led to a society where an 18-year-old girl has the right to public fornication in a pornographic movie – but only if she is paid the minimum wage.  ~ irving kristoli didn't attend the funeral, but i sent a nice letter saying i approved of it. ~ mark twaini can say — not as a patriotic bromide, but with the full knowledge of the necessary metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, political and esthetic roots — that the united states of america are the greatest, the noblest and, in their original founding principles, the only moral country in the history of the world. ~ ayn randi care not much for a man's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it. ~ abraham lincolnthe problem with being “socially liberal, fiscally conservative” is that most of the social liberalism comes with quite a price tag...  ~ mark steynsome people are best loved at a distance. ~ unknownjoan: i wish it didn't hurt so much.god: it hurts because you feel it, joan, because you're alive. you love people. that generates a lot of power, a lot of energy, same kind of energy that binds atoms together. and we've all seen what happens when you try to pry them apart.joan: so if i don't get attached to people, then it won't hurt so much?god: no, it's in your nature to get attached to people. i put that in the recipe. it's when you guys try to ignore that, when you try to go it alone, that's when it gets ugly. its hell. ~ from joan of arcadiasocialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy. ~ winston churchillimagine a labour canvasser talking on the doorstep to those east german families when they settle in on freedom’s side of the wall. “you want to keep more of the money you earn? i’m afraid that’s very selfish. we shall want to tax that away. you want to own shares in your firm? we can’t have that. the state has to own your firm. you want to choose where to send your children to school? that’s very divisive. you’ll send your child where we tell you.” ~ margaret thatcheri always keep a supply of stimulant handy in case i see a snake, which i also keep handy. ~ w. c. fieldsi am extraordinarily patient, provided i get my own way in the end. ~ margaret thatcherby nature all men are equal in liberty, but not in other endowments.  ~ thomas aquinassome see private enterprise as a predatory target to be shot, others as a cow to be milked, but few are those who see it as a sturdy horse pulling the wagon. ~ winston churchilla terrorist is an opportunistic warrior. if he can kill the president, he will. but if he can't, he'll kill you. imagine that. ~ mark steynbeing in politics is like being a football coach. you have to be smart enough to understand the game, and dumb enough to think it’s important. ~ eugene mccarthythe greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding. ~ justice louis brandeisdissent is patriotic only if the dissenter is a patriot. otherwise it's plain old treason. ~ the people's cubenobody has to, i repeat, live in france. but when you live in france, you respect its rules. that is to say that you are not a polygamist. ... one doesn't practice female genital mutilation on one's daughters, one doesn't slit the throat of the sheep, and one respects the republican rules. ~ nicolas sarkozynever be separated from the americans. ~ winston churchillour [conservative] gays are more macho than their [liberal] straights. ~ ann coulterit is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. gentlemen may cry, peace, peace — but there is no peace. the war is actually begun! the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! our brethren are already in the field! why stand we here idle? what is it that gentlemen wish? what would they have? is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? forbid it, almighty god! i know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! ~ patrick henrythe only colors that matter are red, white, and blue. ~ bobby jindalif iraq is another vietnam, 9/11 is another kennedy assassination. were bali, madrid and london also inside jobs by the bush gang? if so, it's no wonder federal spending's out of control. ~ mark steynno people in history have ever survived, who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies. ~ dean achesonif i didn't, i should have. ~ william f. buckley (when asked if he referred to jesse jackson as an ignoramus)always vote for principle, though you may vote alone, and you may cherish the sweetest reflection that your vote is never lost. ~ john quincy adamsin my opinion, powder and artillery are the most efficacious, sure, and infallible conciliatory measures we can adopt. ~ john adamsthe winner of the democratic primary is always the candidate who does the best impersonation of an american. ~ ann coulterthe urge to save humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it. ~ h. l. menckenthinking about what you can't control only wastes energy, and creates its own enemy. ~ worf (star trek - the next generation)but we should at least stop fooling ourselves. jihadists are not going to be wished away, rule-of-lawed into submission, or democratized out of existence. if you really want democracy and the rule of law in places like pakistan, you need to kill the jihadists first. or they’ll kill you, just like, today, they killed benazir bhutto. ~ andrew c. mccarthysatan laughs at our toiling, mocks at our wisdom, but trembles when we pray. ~ the kneeling christianto regret religion is to regret western civilization. ~ theodore dalrympleconservative speakers are constantly being physically attacked on college campuses -- including bill kristol, pat buchanan, david horowitz and me, among others. fortunately the attackers are democrats, so they throw like girls and generally end up with their noses bloodied by pretty college coeds. but that doesn't make it right. ~ ann coulterdon't tase me bro! ~ andrew meyerthere is sobbing of the strong,and a pall upon the land,but the people in their weeping,bare the iron hand,beware the people weeping,when they bare the iron hand. ~ herman melvillegay diversity is like the village people. you can all wear different stupid outfits as long as you sing the same stupid song. ~ jack donovanthe dark night of fascism is always descending in the united states and yet lands only in europe. ~ tom wolfeusually the nonsense liberals spout is kind of cute, but in wartime their instinctive idiocy is life-threatening. ~ ann coulterthese days, the left advances its causes more effectively through the courts than through elections, for the fairly obvious reason that very few people are dumb enough to vote for this stuff. ~ mark steynfor the gay establishment, the death of right and wrong began when gaining civil rights ceased to be enough. ~ tammy brucefirearms are second only to the constitution in importance; they are the peoples' liberty's teeth. ~ george washington (attributed)a free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies. ~ george washington (first state of the union address)government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. ~ thomas painewe don't thrive on military acts. we do them because we have to, and thank god we are efficient. ~ golda meirlet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we will pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty. ~ john f. kennedywe've finally given liberals a war against fundamentalism, and they don't want to fight it. they would, except it would put them on the same side as the united states. ~ ann coulterwe doubt emma lazarus ever thought of: give me your tired, your poor, your indonesians yearning to be sex slaves for muslims in denver. it is called the 'statue of liberty', isn't it? ~ debbie schlusselwar is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. ~ john stuart milli think a baseball bat is the most effective way these days (to talk to liberals). ~ ann coulteramericans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. ~ james madisonfear not your enemies for they can only kill youfear not your friends for they can only betray youfear only the indifferent who permit the killers and betrayers to walk safely on earth. ~ edmund yashinskiwe are a nation that has a government — not the other way around. and this makes us special among the nations of the earth. our government has no power except that granted it by the people. it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed. ~ ronald reaganhow much longer should we allow people from certain lands, with certain beliefs to come to britain and america and build their mosques, teach hate, and plot to kill us? okay, let’s have the required disclaimer: not all muslims from the middle east and southeast asia want to kill us, but those who do blend in with those who don’t. would anyone tolerate a slow spreading cancer because it wasn’t fast spreading? probably not. you’d want it removed. ~ cal thomasi am convinced, if i kill every reporter, that there'll be news from hell before breakfast. ~ general william tecumseh shermandon't hit at all if it is honorably possible to avoid hitting; but never hit softly. ~ theodore rooseveltremember, remember - and realise that america has never retaliated for 9/11 in anything like the way it could have. ~ tony parsons, british journalist...the aim of a large swathe of the left is not to win the debate but to get it cancelled before it starts. ~ mark steyni do not look upon these united states as a finished product. we are still in the making. ~ franklin d. rooseveltto liberals, building a wall across the mexican border is a violation of the voting rights act. ~ ann coultertwo years after 'the day america changed forever,' the culture is in thrall to the same dopey self-delusion it held on sept. 10, 2001: there are no enemies, just friends we haven't yet apologized to. ~ mark steyn...the natural state of the world is darfur. the freakish aberration is america and the rest of the anglo-saxon world. ~ ann coulterand yes, i believe our republic and liberty is in danger. not in a "doomsday tomorrow! run for your lives!" sort of way. the danger lies, rather, in giving up our birthright for a pot of stew and some bread. ~ kevinqcremember, the government apparatchiks have to go through the rest of the house to get to your bedroom. it's best to stop them at the bottom of the driveway. ~ kevinqc






25 things about me

 1) i don't like cooked onions. raw onions... great. cooked onions... blech.2) i'm shy. really, i am. and the peanut gallery can just shut up... but seriously - this tendency makes me seem snobbish at times even though i'm not.3) i don't consider third world countries to be "vacation" destinations.4) i can't drive a stick shift.5) i'm a republican.6) i love algebra but hate geometry.7) my mother died when i was 3.8)  i still use the words "whom" and "whomever" when speaking and writing, and i get aggravated when others do not.9) in fourth grade i was nominated to represent my class on the student council but i was so shy and insecure i wouldn't do it. i still regret that decision.10) i hate snakes, but once - while holding one - i threatened to throw it at someone.11) there are a few friends i have not seen in years that if we met today we could pick up in mid conversation as if no time has passed.12)  i never really knew my father. he reached out to me shortly before he died but i chose to ignore him. i don't regret that.13) there have been two people in my life that i have truly been in love with.14) i've owned six dogs over the years - 1. a pekingese named tuffy, 2. a lab mix named buster, 3. a chow named chanté, 4. a mutt named kroger, 5. a chow/shepherd mix named virginia, and currently 6. a mix of canine and god knows what else named matilda.15) in mrs. leighton's third grade class, desi g. used to always borrow my new crayons and without fail break at least one.16) i like bad scifi movies. really, really bad ones. like lorenzo lamas fighting velociraptors bad.17) i can't ice skate or roller blade. weak ankles.18) i always remember my dreams after i wake up, and they're always in full color.19) i'm clumsy. (that's also a big factor in #17)20) i was never a dallas or dynasty person. i was all falcon crest, baby!21) my favorite color is green.22) i worked in the hotel and tradeshow biz for eight years and as a result i've seen las vegas more than any person should. as a side note, you might think the gay bars there would be hoppin' - but in reality they are bleak and sad.23) my favorite season is autumn. second favorite is winter. spring is okay. summer sucks.24) i love vodka. passionately.25) i will not swim in anything other than a crystal clear swimming pool. the ocean has sharks and ponds and rivers have snakes and alligators. i regard swimming in them as akin to walking unarmed across the serengeti. (as for the serengeti, see #3)-obligatory 26th thing-26) the first person i came out to in college ended up being totally unable to deal with it and our friendship ended. i still miss him.
