“i suddenly realise that just knowing there are people like dr venn around to look after us, will help me sleep a little easier at night.”— mark king - the guardian














take a look at our google reviews!mr jd***** april 2022my experience with sussex sleep services has been nothing short of excellent. karen and dr venn were excellent at communicating with me and the whole process from original contact to having my consultation was extremely quick. i highly recommend sussex sleep services to anyone who has troubles with sleeping, there was genuine care and options to go down, and i am very grateful to dr venn for the help and support i have receivedmr sb***** march 2022very good service. very clear and helpful. straight to the point and no confusing dialogue. makes everything comfortable and helps you to understand what is wrong. results were fast and support was there when needed. also karen is very fast to respond with emails and queries. mr ww***** january 2022dr. venn and team were very helpful in providing objective information about my sleep condition. he has left me with several options to pursue without a sense of being pushed into any particular course of treatment. it has been very helpful experience mrs jb***** january 2022i have nothing but praise for the sussex sleep services. i needed an urgent update on my sleep apnoea diagnosis, so that an operation could go ahead. dr venn's secretary, karen, was extremely helpful and a video consultation was booked with dr venn for the next day. dr venn was very reassuring and carefully went through all my medical history. he answered all my questions and was very supportive. a sleep assessment was set up and took place within 48 hours. finally, dr venn rang to discuss the results with me, which thankfully were very positive. so thank you all for your support and reassurance throughout a very stressful few days. mr d le g***** january 2022i was diagnosed with sleep apnea four years ago and have struggled with using the cpap treatment since then. cpap treatment is essential for some patients to treat their condition, but the advantages were more nuanced for me. i decided to take control of my treatment and seek expert advice. for the first time since my original diagnosis, i had the opportunity to discuss my treatment thoroughly. although the pandemic restricted the meeting to zoom with dr venn, we went through my medical history and my experience of cpap for a whole hour. i finally got answers to questions and discussed all my options in an open and relaxed consultation. for anyone struggling with their cpap treatment or considering treatment for snoring or poor sleep quality, i can highly recommend a consultation with sussex sleep services. over the last few years, i have spent many hours reading about sleep apnea and learning about the treatment options. dr venn offers some of the best expertise you can access in the uk, in my opinion.
