  who we are



created in 1979, the illinois guardianship and advocacy commission protects the rights and promotes the welfare of persons with disabilities.

a board of eleven commissioners, who serve without compensation, govern the agency. the commission is an executive state agency created to safeguard the rights of persons with disabilities.
by providing legal representation, investigating complaints of rights violations and providing state guardianship for illinois' population with disabilities, the commission has given voice to those who have previously gone unheard.
