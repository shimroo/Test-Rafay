                                        i had a good experience because sending flowers to a funeral/viewing that i was not able to attend. got a call from the florist to make sure what i wanted on the custom ribbon. that is very good customer service and even had a good suggestion. so i will definitely use again in the future if needed.

                                        over the years, i have come to trust dolly's to exceed my expectations whenever i use the company to deliver flowers on my behalf. it never disappoints. i will continue to buy from dolly's for all the occasions that i need flowers for. great service, guys!

                                        hospitality was key with this purchase. i initially purchased a small dish plant, however the dolly florist representative offered me an upgrade to a peace lily. the plant was beautiful and the family loved it. thank you very much
