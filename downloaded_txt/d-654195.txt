observe the sky






with a telescope or a telescope, the moon offers really spectacular visions, especially when it is in crescent and when we observe the border between the illuminated part and the non illuminated part, where the reliefs are accentuated
                      by the grazing light of the sun.
the main planets are also very interesting: even if the image remains very small, we immediately perceive their spherical shape and we can see some details like the rings of saturn, the gas bands and satellites of jupiter, the phases
                      of venus, etc.
