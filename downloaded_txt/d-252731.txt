127.

            if someone experiences trust and consciousness in the heart of the embrace,
            they become a child of light.
            if someone does not receive these,
            it is because they remain attached to what they know;
            when they cease to be attached, they will be able to receive them.
            whoever receives this light in nakedness will no longer be recognizable;
            none will be able to grasp them, none will be able to make them sad or miserable,
            whether they are in this world, or have left it.
            they already know the truth in images.
            for them, this world has become another world,
            and this temple space [aeon] is fullness [pleroma],
            they are who they are. they are one.
            neither shadow nor night can hide them.
