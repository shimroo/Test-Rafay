doge will only work when government agencies compete

                the sluggishness and dysfunction across our government is unmistakable. one proposed solution is to eliminate the duplication of functions. we have a better idea. make agencies compete for customers, just like private firms do.

democrats loved ‘unelected power’ until trump turned their own weapons against them

                trump and his team can only act so aggressively, across so much of american government and american life, because they have grasped the tools created by democrats and progressive advocates over the past century. of course, trump is using those tools in ways their architects never anticipated, branding them with irony.

the deeper meaning behind trump’s blizzard of actions

                here is a summary in case you are keeping score. trump has done more in a few weeks than any president in history. he is acting swiftly before his political capital dissipates. he has two overriding goals: to build a lasting maga movement and to roll back the bureaucratic state.

trump’s first 10 days have overwhelmed the democrats – and the liberal media

                trump is moving so fast on so many issues at once, it’s hard to single out what matters most. here are four of the new administration’s most important initiatives, and why trump is able to move on them so swiftly.

when government officials are threatened, they deserve protection

                if public officials (today's or yesterday's) are threatened because of what they did in office, they deserve protection. they may not deserve our gratitude. they may not deserve our thanks and appreciation. that depends on…when us officials and former officials face lethal dangers for the work they did in office, they deserve protection from the country they served. that’s true whether they served the country well or poorly, whether they can pay fo...

president trump’s ‘first hundred hours’

                the media has focused on the substance of trump's exeecutive orders, and understandably so. but their substantive content is only half the story. the other half is the swift, decisive process.

biden opens the jailhouse door

                joe biden is not going gently into that dark night, politically or cognitively. he is going down with large, bold actions. the latest is a mass commutation for some 2,500 “nonviolent drug offenders.” biden’s justification is that they were sentenced under laws that have now been overturned as the country has moved to more lenient treatment of all drug of...

joe biden’s reputation is already in tatters. history’s judgment will be even harsher

                as memories of american presidents fade, only a few salient thoughts linger about each one. voters are too busy complaining about the next president to remember much more.richard nixon is remembered for watergate, and gerald ford for pardoning him. lyndon johnson is remembered for the civil rights laws of the mid-1960s, the vietnam war, and the “great society” welfare programmes.jimmy carter will be remembered, after the encomiums for his recent death fade away, for the gas crisis, iranian hosta...

when is a fire an earthquake?

                the fire now engulfing l.a. will soon engulf the politicians who failed to protect them. voters will hold newsom and bass responsible for failed leadership, misplaced priorities, the misuse of high tax revenues (no one can say californians are undertaxed), and policy choices that failed.

what is doge’s hardest task?

                doge’s hardest task is not cutting the excess federal payroll but cutting excess federal regulations. to succeed, doge needs to focus on four overriding goals:(1) reducing the dead-weight drag of regulations on the economy without removing essential safeguards; (2) making significant changes, not minor ones; (3) ensuring those changes have an enduring impact by making them difficult to reverse; and (4) increasing democratic oversight of future rule-making, a legislative responsibility that congress has wrongfully (and perhaps unconstitutionally) abdicated.

the legacy of jimmy carter

                his president was a corrective from the nixon years but failure in its own right. he was remarkable in forging a productive life after leaving office. instead of grifting and selling access to policymakers, like so many former politicians do today, he had a distinguished second career promoting and monitoring democratic elections around the world.

the winners and losers in the fight to keep the government open

                the first two continuing resolutions failed because they contained a trainload of pork, a steaming pile of non-essential provisions that rank-and-file republicans refused to support. they learned about the bill’s hidden provisions thanks to a new media landscape, which featured blogs and podcasts with huge audiences, free speech on “x,” and the use of ai (specifically elon musk’s grok) to undercover what was in the bill. the problems will come in a couple of months when the short-term measure ends.

joe biden has vanished, leaving behind an almighty mess

                america’s slow transfer of power leaves a long gap between voting and inauguration. that gap has been especially strange this year for two reasons. first, pres. biden has virtually disappeared from the public scene. second, donald trump has come to dominate it, moving swiftly to assemble his incoming team and receiving bended knees from supplicants, at home and abroad.

what’s flying over new jersey?

                the public is frightened, and bland reassurances from washington aren’t helping. neither is a wagging finger from the government’s pr flaks, who don’t give citizens any real information but tell them to calm down. when you unpack the obfuscation, white house officials are making two basic points. 1. we don’t know what the objects are or where they came from.2. don't worry about it.the two statements are inconsistent, and the public knows it. they want real answers, not false assurances. the government’s communication problems are compounded by a simple fact: they have lied so often about so much that nobody believes their statements without proof.

the death rattle of dei

                the democrats may have lost because of a bad economy and bad candidate, but they compounded their troubles with unpopular stances on key social issues. one of the most prominent was “dei”, compulsory programs for hiring, admission, and training in many universities and corporations. the public and the courts have finally had enough.

a solution to football’s fake-injury problem

                fake injuries have become an increasing problem in college football, slowing the game and threatening its integrity. here’s a simple rule change to stop the fakery. keep injured players out longer after they stop play. that won’t hurt teams with real injuries. their players have to stay out longer anyway. but it would deter a lot of fake injuries, designed to slow down an opponent and gain an uncredited time out.

the democrats after the deluge

                losing parties always search for explanations. when they lose big – when they lose the white house and both houses of congress – that search becomes a full-scale reckoning. what went wrong for democrats? how can they correct it?those questions aren’t lacking for answers. the problem is sorting out the ones that really matter.the easiest answer – and surely part of the explanation – is “we need a better candidate”. kamala harris was truly dreadful. but that only raises another question: how did t...

the rise and fall of jews on campus | sapir journal

                the open, virulent, and sometimes violent eruption of antisemitism at elite universities may be the most daunting social challenge faced by american jews since the ku klux klan’s antisemitic campaign in the 1960s. in the 1960s, elite universities were pressured to do away with long-standing discrimination in admissions and hiring. to diversify their student bodies and faculties, they opened their gates widely to those from different backgrounds. this transformation, which stressed merit and equal standards, without invidious discrimination, helped make american universities the best in the world and our nation a more perfect union. but on its coattails came pockets of far-left radicalism. the strength of this movement of campus radicals grew over decades as it infiltrated and overhauled university administrations and power centers, emerging as the dominant social force on elite campuses. today, many universities have morphed into hotbeds of illiberalism and antisemitism.

what disputes about trans athletes say about democratic politics

                strong ideological views may win primaries but lose general elections, at least in purple states. that is the coming battle between “coastal progressives” and center-left democrats from the midwest and south. social issues, such as transgenders in sports and locker rooms, will divide them.

what comes after trump’s decisive victory?

                the overriding questions for democrats whether they can move beyond blaming personalities (biden and harris), consider fundamental issues and reshape the party to address them. for the republicans, the question is whether it can accomplish most of the ambitious agenda donald trump has promised. he has pulled off the most astounding political comeback in american political history. now, can he pull off a successful administration?

a consequential, divisive, troubling election about big issues

                this election is the most consequential since franklin d. roosevelt defeated herbert hoover amid the great depression. the 2024 vote is consequential, too. it is about big issues, on which the two parties are deeply divided. the parties differ dramatically on border control, tax cuts, school choice, gun rights, reproductive freedom, stronger law enforcement, and many more. taken together, those differences define a deep fault line in american politics. that chasm and repeated attacks (from all sides) on our constitutional framework make our public life perilous. america is resilient, but we are recklessly testing the limits of “e pluribus unum,” one out of many.

biden scores another ‘own goal’ over trump’s ‘garbage’ supporters

                while pres. biden called trump supporters “garbage,” he vilified half the country he governs. his communications team compounded the problem by falsely claiming he didn’t say what everyone could hear for themselves on tape. their clumsy efforts kept the story alive for 2-3 more days. dumb. the “garbage” comments are actually three overlapping stories. one is the damage he did to harris. (probably minimal.) the second is how the tape clearly shows biden’s failing health. the third is the white house’s desperate efforts to conceal the president’s condition from the public, a subject kamala harris won’t touch.

                american politics is sinking deeper and deeper in the muck during the final week of an increasingly negative and vitriolic campaign. the latest foul addition to the augean stables is to call whole groups “garbage”.bad as that language is, the problem is even greater. it’s also the lame excuses for it, the failure to condemn it immediately when someone on “our side” uses it. that failure suggests the language is either tolerable or trivial. it’s neither.this vile language needs to be condemned –...
