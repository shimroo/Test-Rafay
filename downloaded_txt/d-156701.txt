            innovation strategy
          










studies have proven that companies that approach innovation methodically delivered 2x revenue growth, compared to those following a haphazard approach.an innovation strategy is a 3-year roadmap that sets out: 1) the innovation objectives; 2) what innovation model is appropriate to deploy; 3) what effort and resources are required, and 4) how innovation will deliver tangible value to the business and contribute to the overall corporate strategy.








            innovation programming & labs
          










the streets of startupland are paved with ill fated corporate innovation labs. the nature and model of any innovation program deployed should be dictated by the objectives set out in an innovation strategy. different models of formal innovation programs and labs that can be deployed fall into one of two categories. buy: such as collaborating with startups through pocs and pilotsbuild: such as developing new technology, business models, and products. no matter the chosen model, it is universally important to: adopt a portfolio approach; thoroughly test assumptions about the core business; conduct experiments; acquire knowledge that can shape future business decisions, and focus on solving problems for the business or customers.








            pilots with startups
          










multiplicity focuses on unlocking the win-win opportunities when enterprise and startups successfully complete projects together and deliver tangible results. unfortunately, enterprise and startups still struggle to successfully collaborate, therefore we believe the magnitude of these opportunities has yet to be fully realized. multiplicity often acts as the "ceo of the project", being responsible for designing, launching, and managing pilot projects with startups to ensure successful completion on behalf of our clients. our approach is based on our proprietary collaborative scoping framework, which we have developed over six years of experience in running corporate innovation pilot projects.








            capability building & cultural change
          










an organization's culture must be conducive to experimentation, calculated risk taking, ownership, customer empathy, adaptability and continuous evolution for sustained innovation to be possible. more specifically, if these cultural characteristics are underdeveloped, an innovation team will struggle to find support from leadership and alignment with business units.at multiplicity, we naturally infuse our entrepreneurial dna into every client strategy and project, while also incorporating elements of capability building by transferring the principles of innovation and entrepreneurial methodologies that we use.








            proprietary projects
          










multiplicity is built on a foundation of entrepreneurial dna. entrepreneurs envision a future, then work to make that reality come true. our proprietary projects are not driven by clients' mandates, but are our own speculative passion projects that we feel interesting, are beneficial to society, or provide some public good.
