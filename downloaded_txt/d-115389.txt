the hub of local business since 1945
the grand prairie chamber of commerce represents a unique partnership with business, civic and educational leaders. it is our goal to become the foremost resource for goods and services for both businesses and citizens of grand prairie.  shopping and doing business locally is key to helping chamber businesses grow, attracting new businesses and giving citizens and businesses everything they need locally, from someone they know and trust. 
the grand prairie chamber of commerce includes and supports all entrepreneurs, offers programs, networking and opportunities to members, with no tolerance for discrimination. we value and encourage the sharing of ideas and experiences across cultures, for the progress and growth of all.  the grand prairie chamber of commerce was founded in 1945 and continues to achieve our mission, “to promote, strengthen and expand the business community” of grand prairie.  

the city of grand prairie is ideally located in the heart of the dallas/fort worth metroplex. just minutes south of the dallas/fort worth airport, the city is home to more than 200,000 people, including families that have lived here for generations and others who have moved here for the quality of life. our ideal location, excellent access, forward-focused local leaders, hometown feeling, established and new neighborhoods – these are just some of the qualities that make grand prairie highly desirable, attracting new businesses and residents.
our chamber is the first step in building business relationships in grand prairie. stop in our office at 900 conover drive, grand prairie or call us at 972-264-1558; we are ready to help your business grow!
