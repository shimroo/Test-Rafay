the mini golf app
we are very excited to introduce the mini golf app to our customers.

 we think this app will be of serious interest to owners of mini golf courses. 



the app becomes your app and is tailored to your courses, your branding and your holes. we can even provide the castle golf designs of your holes to personalise your app with hole graphics and bring these to life, enhancing the player experience with animations. 



your players will enjoy the simple to use swipe based score card with beautiful hole animations to help guide them around your course. 



you (the course operator) will enjoy the benefit of a powerful business tool including customer loyalty points, selfies and push notifications.
