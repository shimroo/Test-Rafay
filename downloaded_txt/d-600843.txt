              online dating tips
            


and now, a guest post for your enjoyment!have you or someone you know ever tried dating online? many people have and have been successful, yet just as many come away from the experience unsatisfied and vowing they would never try dating online again.gay dating online is difficult, especially if the site is expensive or doesn’t have updated information. it’s frustrating to find someone online and then realize that your gay or lesbian match isn’t even a member of the site anymore.there are lots of online dating sites out there, but finding the right one can take a lot of trial and error. when looking for a gay dating site, there are some things you can do first to help narrow down your choices.to start with, be sure to check out the site and see if it offers everything you’re looking for – make a checklist of the membership benefits you want and then eliminate the sites that don’t offer them.if possible, sign up for a free trial membership to the sites you like. this can give you access to bios, personals, and pics of other members. if you see someone interesting make a note of where you found them and use the data to help make your choice.last but not least, when you’re trying gay dating online, make sure you are honest in your profile. finding the right homosexual partner will only happen if you are truthful about your own likes, dislikes, and personality.for example, if you love dance music or you’re into pop culture make sure you put that in your profile. being completely honest when using a gay dating site like pridedating.com for instance, will help you find the right gay or lesbian match. whenever you choose online gay dating sites, use these tips and avoid the disappointment.   labels: the gays

              hope
            


i know a lot of people are still troubled by prop 8 but sometimes you have to look past the big things to see the real progress.  when you have a bunch of straight frat boys who are standing up to the bigots, you can see that the change we've all been hoping for is in the works.  it's not going to be by a court ruling, it's going to be because the younger generations are leading the way, they know that everyone deserves to be treated with respect.  that's what real change looks like, it doesn't come through lobbying groups and celebrity fundraisers, it's real people who recognize our common humanity.oh, and frat boys are hot.labels: conservatives, crazy breeders, hope, video
