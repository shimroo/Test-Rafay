doug kelley's work
doug kelley is an eclectic individual with many interests. his work primarily consists of researching and understanding the human 
          condition as well as empowering the human spirit. he conducts his work in several areas summarized below. visit the respective websites for more information.



metaphysical ministry 


 

dr. kelley's ministerial career began decades ago at the age of 21 when he was 
            appointed as an associate minister. a few years later, he was 
            appointed to the position  of full pastor. since that time,
            doug's mission has been to empower the human spirit through education and by helping 
            people get past the things that hold them back. to this end, he founded the
              

              international church of metaphysical humanism (icmh church) 
              to provide an alternative approach to viewing and understanding human consciousness and existence. over the years, he has developed and honed several proprietary metaphysical concepts including the
               life leadership 
            paragontm upon which his ministry's
              
9 principles of belief 
              as well as all of his courses are built (see the next item).  







metaphysical teaching 


 


dr. kelley also founded the
               institute of 
              metaphysical humanistic science (imhs) as one of the primary methods for providing education in metaphysical topics and practical life skills. imhs is a part of 
              icmh church's 
              ministry program and offers non-academic phd degrees in a variety of metaphysical topics such as metaphysical science, spiritual counseling, life coaching, hypnosis, holistic healing 
              (reiki), paranormal science / parapsychology, and ufology. students must apply themselves and study diligently to graduate. the
               international metaphysical practitioners association (impa) was also founded to 
              serve as a reputable association for imhs graduates and other metaphysical practitioners. impa also accredits imhs courses and offers accreditation to other metaphysical schools. 
              in october 2015, thomas francis university was launched to offer 
              standalone and certification courses.







anomalous research 


 


dr. kelley is the founder, president, and chairman of
              paranexus 
              anomalous research association paranexus is a professional trade association of dedicated and progressive ufologists, 
              parapsychologists, and enthusiasts focused on researching and 
              understanding the human condition through the scientific study of 
              aerial, psychical, and anomalous phenomena, its reality, its 
              reach, and its impact on humanity. dougs greatest area of 
              interest and research in the field of anomalous research is the 
              impact of such phenomena on the human condition including the role 
              that a person's unique socio-religious and cultural beliefs have 
              on the type and extent of any paranormal activity experienced. he 
              blends this anthropological approach with an open mind, a 
              make-it-happen attitude, and a deep belief in the indomitable 
              power of the human spirit. he is an outspoken advocate for the 
              need of education in the paranormal field as well as remaining 
              objective and grounded regarding evidence of anomalous phenomena. 
              doug also hosted  paranexus universe, 
              a weekly radio program aimed at helping anomalous researchers. 
              while this show is no longer active, archives of over 150 shows 
              are available on the paranexus website.

              no charge on the er website. the site also offers a free forum for people to get help and support.

              skills to thousands of managers in seminars across the u.s. and puerto rico. he has also presented corporate in-house training to a number of companies. this experience allowed him to 
              develop many personal and professional leadership concepts and models, such as the aforementioned  life leadership 
            paragontm as well as a behavioral profile and an assertiveness profile. doug's style of speaking is 
              down-to-earth and conversational; but he doesn't hold back from asking direct questions that make people think. dr. kelley is available for in-house training on a variety of business and

about dr. kelley's coaching/counseling


 



"if you want the truth presented in a no-holds barred, objective, in-your-face manner for grown-ups-only (when you need 
                it), then you want to talk to doug. his style of honesty laced with the compassion of 'having been there' helped turn my life aroundquickly and permanently. many thanks!" diana c., 
                director of marketing 

"doug . . . your impact has been tremendous on my life. you helped me get through a difficult time in my life by bringing 
                insight into an alcoholic relationship i was unable to remove myself from. previously i had felt that i had very little control over the things that were happening to me and around me. 
                you provided me with the necessary tools and honest, even sometimes tough advice to help me realize that i already had the strength and resources to deal with things and move forward 
                with my life! thank you from the bottom of my heart!" linda w., quality assurance engineer 

"when i first started coaching sessions with doug my life was in chaos. i was confused, depressed and did not know where to 
                turn any longer. i had sought help from other professionals and although they listened to me, i never felt that anyone truly understood how i was feeling or would be able to help me. 
                it was discouraging. doug was different because he asked the tough questions that made me look further into myself, questions that no one else had ever asked me before. although he 
                spoke to me honestly, directly, to the core and with no sugar coating, it was never without empathy and kindness to me as a person. he did not give me the answers but patiently and 
                relentlessly guided me until i figured them out for myself. he taught me how to like myself again and how to be responsible for my own happiness. my life has turned in a completely new 
                and positive direction since i have been coached by doug. i have grown and changed in ways unimaginable to me before. i am happy and excited to begin each new day. i would highly 
                recommend dougs coaching to anyone in need of support or advice of any kind. i can assure you it will be a life-changing decision you will not regret." joelle r., legal and business 
                affairs coordinator, imax corporation, ontario, canada

"doug kelley and his empowered recovery program saved my life. while searching for answers to why loved ones can put their 
                addictions above all else, doug showed me that the answers lie within ones self. his gentle coaching style belies the wisdom he possesses in helping to understand that alcoholics and 
                drug addicts make their own choices and their loved ones are not responsible for those choices. he challenges you in a no holds barred yet empathetic way to look inward and find the 
                strength to accept your pain, grieve your losses, rediscover yourself and find the strength to not only move on, but become a better, well rounded individual who recognizes that you 
                have control over no one but yourself. he has taught me that i have the choice to wallow in self-pity or to take control of my future. his coaching style is one of compassion and not 
                trickery. he will not box you into a corner and leave you to ponder in obscurity. his experiences have taught him that though the answers lie within, not everyone knows where to look 
                and he points you in the right direction allowing you to discover, at your own pace, the answers you seek. recovery from loss of any kind is an individual journey and doug recognizes 
                this. he has not forgotten the unbearable pain and will not tell you to deny it, but help you find a way to cope until you discover the inner strength that he knows you hold within 
                yourself, and to move forward. to speak to doug kelley is to learn what a friend really is. he is accepting and non-judgmental. while so many others tell you what you ought to be, doug 
                will help you rediscover who you really are and how to be comfortable with that. not only has my life been saved, but it has been enriched by the privilege of having doug as my 
                friend." lawrence y., kittery, maine
