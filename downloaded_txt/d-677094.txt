"martha’s vineyard in the mountains…understated, quiet elegance, far removed from the sturm & drang of it’s colossal neighbor, the homestead. everything about gristmill square screams charm, and delivers. highly recommend for the discriminating traveler, a must."

"i don’t normally leave a review, of any kind, but this place is too good not to! such a hidden gem. crazy close to the jefferson pools and the homestead. adorable rooms, and breakfast is included and brought to your door! the waterwheel restaurant is on site and has a surprisingly incredible menu, but also an ambiance that can’t be beat. we love everything about this adorable place and cannot wait to come back!"
