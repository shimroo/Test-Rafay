welcome tofishers of menat fishers of men, we hold onto god and his word, and strive to live out our faith here in fort bend county.  god demonstrated that he is "for us" by sending his perfect son, jesus, to die and rise again to raise us to a new life with him."what, then, shall we say in response to this? if god is for us, who can be against us?" romans 8:31we believe our calling is to demonstrate that god is "for" you!  we strive to do that through worship, teaching, and other events to help you experience his love and life.
