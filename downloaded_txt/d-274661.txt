pat 
              mestern's fifth work of historical fiction no 
              choice but freedom isbn 1932158766 is a tale 
              of treachery and triumph in c1750 colonial virginia 
              and the carolinas. like pat’s previous novels, no choice but freedom will be known for its 
              meticulous attention to detail, gripping storyline 
              and unforgettable characters.  to quote j. marshall craig, 
    author and playwright: pat mestern's meteoric 
    imagination has never been more impressive than 
    in this empowering, almost epic, colonial american 
    period piece about a woman whose destiny was bartered 
    most unexpectedly and whose fierce resistance against 
    injustice to not only herself but those in her sphere 
    of influence is so thoroughly convincing one can 
    easily imagine it to be an historical account rather 
    than the clever weave of fiction that, in reality, 
    it is. a canadian author clearly inspired by her 
    real-life travels through the cradle of the american 
    revolution, it would not be an overstatement to 
    suggest that mestern is canada's answer to pulitzer 
    prize-winning american author anne proulx and that 
    mestern's border-hopping accomplishment might be 
    distantly - but not inaccurately - compared to proulx's 
    elaborate creations inspired by similar travels 
    in foreign lands, such as her acclaimed newfoundland-based 
    the shipping news. no choice but freedom 
    is as accomplished and appealing and deserves the 
    same notice.


if you would like an author-signed copy of no choice 
    but freedom please use the handy order form

the 
      book in question is entitled "magdalena's song". 
      this is pat's fourth work of fiction and receiving 
      great reviews across north america. "magdalena's 
      song" is written with humour and compassion "magdalena's 
      song" is the story of a village suddenly 
      wakened from years of apathy and restraint. 1947 
      is a year of transition. the war is over. the world 
      has changed. people are restless. relationships 
      are strained. men have returned from the war physically 
      and psychologically exhausted. during thirteen days 
      in the autumn of 1947, the mysterious count daniel 
      cudzinki proves there is common sense, integrity 
      and harmony in the midst of chaos. this timely work 
      of fiction will appeal to a wide audience, male 
      and female, young and old.
"magdalena's song" is available under isbn 0-9713045-8-0 at bookstores 
    across north america including www.amazon.com,
