about our company
ed hume seeds is a family owned and operated business located in the pacific nw. we’ve been selling the highest quality seeds and garden products since 1977.  our seed line is specially selected for short season and cool climate areas. this makes our varieties perfect for high altitudes and early or late planting in warm climates. our main goal through the years has been, and continues to be, providing the best quality products to our customers. for this reason we use only seeds from the current crop. 
100% of our unsold seeds are donated to charities worldwide the end of the year instead of being held over for resale the following year. as a small business we strongly support recycling efforts and believe that gardening is one of the better things you can do to improve the environment, and your own health. we are constantly striving to make this website an informative, enjoyable resource for all your gardening needs.  check back, we update often!
