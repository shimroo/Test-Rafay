        many people contact us about buying one of our many domain names we registered back in the
        1990's and are told we seldom sell our names but we are happy to rent them. i hope this
        page will help answer some questions and explain what we do. if you have other questions
        or would like to discuss the rental of one of our names feel free to e-mail 
		us at 
		info @ domainnamerentals.com. 
renting a domain name may seem unusual but the same laws
        apply to the rental of a domain name that do for the rental of an office or storefront.
we have been renting our domains since 2004 and we are one
        of the first companies to offer rentals of domain names.  with years of experience,
        we are leaders in the rental field. renting domain names has been our vision since 1998
        when we acquired the domain name domainnamerentals.com.

        our lessee that prevent us from selling or renting the domain for a year after your lease expires.
q. can i get an option to buy the domain name?

        them at reasonable prices but if we can agree on a price that the domain name will be worth at a future date then yes.
q. how long do your leases run?
a. up to 10 years with a 5 year option.

        the average is around $1,000 a year.
q. who is responsible for renewing the domain name?
a. we are, all our domains are automatically renewed
        so they will never expire.

        get out of the lease?

        name.

        domain  names does the lease go with it?
