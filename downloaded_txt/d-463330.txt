wolgemut: historically inspired entertainment

12th c. latin songs of the goliards, 13th c. spanish "cantigas", 14th c. italian court dances, german "minnelied", 16th c. french dances and rollicking english country dances of the 17th c.  damn, there's alot here to work with, for both costuming and dancing!

dancing at the md renn fest


what an experience! ruta, nan and i danced with wolgemut on saturday, then ruta and i danced with them on sunday. i really wish that nan was there for sunday, but the whole weekend was unspeakably incredible. between wolgemut and gypsophilia and even "o", the music was amazing, and would have been, even if i had not the priviledge of dancing with them. they have definitely always been two of my favorite groups there.if things go as planned (knock on wood), the four of us, ruta, nan, stacy and i, will be dancing there next year as well. craig already said that he supports me on this, and that means alot to me, especially since i know very well that he doesn't understand my drive to do this.some of my research will include costuming ideas in cultures in the same time period as wolgemut and traditional dance steps for their songs. we're thinking that persian dress might be the way to go, but we'll see. wolgemutgypsophilia
