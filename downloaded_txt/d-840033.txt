the betaseed story


find out how betaseed became the number one sugarbeet seed brand for growers in north america.










our story
in 1970 a pickup truck offering sugarbeet seed for sale hit the dusty roads in rural minnesota in hopes of selling seed to sugarbeet growers. the germplasm within the seed was obtained from a combination of sources: the usda, proprietary genetics from overseas, and refined genetics that offered a new tool to sugarbeet growers across north america. this new tool was the basis for betaseed: a company completely devoted to independent breeding, development and distribution of ever-improving sugarbeet performance. since its inception, betaseed has been offering productivity and revenue to north american sugarbeet growers. through our âfarm firstâ approach, betaseed sugarbeet seed is planted on more farms than any other seed brand.
