  president's message
  robb gonda

it’s an honor to serve as the president of the ohio middle level association. our organization is committed to supporting young adolescents and the educators, administrators, and mentors who work with this remarkable age group. omla’s vision is to “educate, advocate, and celebrate the uniqueness of all that is middle-level education.” middle school is a time of profound growth and change, making it essential to create meaningful moments that resonate with students and help them recognize their unique potential. as maya angelou once said, “people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” it’s in these moments of connection and support that young people discover confidence, curiosity, and resilience. through teamwork, advisory programs, interdisciplinary learning, and partnerships among schools, families, and communities, we can build environments where every young adolescent feels seen, supported, and ready to thrive. as president, i invite you to join us as an omla member. by doing so, you’ll gain access to engaging professional development opportunities, avenues to recognize and celebrate the achievements of colleagues, and ways to connect locally as an affiliate. together, let’s continue to inspire and empower one another, creating meaningful moments that shape young lives. our organization’s strength comes from each of you who are passionate about middle-level education and dedicated to your students’ success.
