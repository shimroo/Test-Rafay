fred greenlee's 1989 fj1300

rpm suspension components continue to set the new standard for the yamaha fj1100/1200. these patented components offer the best of both worlds in shock/fork performance. the patented bypass valve allows for what has been decribed as "a magic carpet ride" when absorbing the bumps and the "most stable my bike has ever felt" when diving off into the corner. look for rpm shocks and fork valves in the featured items section.

there was a recent ride of a rpm suspension fitted motorcycle by a fully outfitting usd & penske fj owner. the response to that ride was...
"that is the smoothest fj i have ever ridden"
