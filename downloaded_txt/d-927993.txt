kendrick lamar, the first rapper to win a pulitzer prize for music and native of compton, california, performed at the 59th super bowl in new orleans on sunday. the show featured serena williams, samuel l. jackson as uncle sam, and even in the midst of a legal battle with drake, lamar went through with playing “not like us” — a diss track in his long-time feud with drake. analysts of the performance said it was full of symbolism, both politically and regarding the history of black people in america. halftime show watchers had opinions — they either loved it or hated it. did you like the super bowl halftime show?
