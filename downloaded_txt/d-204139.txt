she is the golden bridge, the wonderful fire.
the luminous heart of the unknown is she,
a power of silence in the depths of god;
she is the force, the inevitable word,.....

 the mother on sri aurobindo 
 
two things you must never forget: sri aurobindo's compassion and the mother's love, and it is with these two things that you will go on fighting steadily, patiently, until the enemies are definitively routed and the victory is won for ever. courage outside, peace inside and a quiet unshakable trust in the divine's grace. -the mother19 may 1933    
***
the mother
it is always better to try to concentrate in a centre, the centre of aspiration, one might say, the place where the flame of aspiration burns, to gather in all the energies there, at the solar plexus centre and, if possible, to obtain an attentive silence as though one wanted to listen to something extremely subtle, something that demands a complete attention, a complete concentration and total silence. and then not to move at all. not to think, not to stir, and make that movement of opening so as to receive all that can be received, but taking good care not to try to know what is happening while it is happening, for if one wants to understand or even to observe actively, it keeps up a sort of cerebral activity which is unfavourable to the fullness of the receptivity -to be silent, as totally silent as possible, in an attentive concentration, and then be still.
      if one succeeds in this, then, when everything is over, when one comes out of meditation, some time later -usually not immediately -from within the being something new emerges in the consciousness: a new understanding, a new appreciation of things, a new attitude in life- in short, a new way of being.

sri aurobindo is constantly in the subtle physical, very active there. i see him almost daily, and last night i spent many hours with him.
if you become conscious in the subtle physical you will surely meet him......    
the words of the mother 
when in your heart and thought you make no difference between sri aurobindo and me, when to think of sri aurobindo will be to think of me and to think of me will mean to think of sri aurobindo inevitably, when to see one will mean inevitably to see the other, like one and the same person, -- then you will know that you begin to be open to the supramental force and consciousness. - volume 13, pp.1-35


the surest way towards this integral fulfilment is to find the
      master of the secret who dwells within us, open ourselves constantly
      to the divine power which is also the divine wisdom and
      love and trust to it to effect the conversion.
