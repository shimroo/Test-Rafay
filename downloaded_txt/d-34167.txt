                          belmanage

                          belmanage allows users to reduce their software license and
                          maintenance costs, monitor their cybersecurity status and
                          configuration details. belmanage is based on belarc's
                          cloud architecture, uses a single intranet server and
                          database, and automatically creates an accurate and up-to-date
                          central repository (cmdb) of software, hardware and security
                          configuration details.

autodesk



















                  autodesk uses belarc's system on over 16,000 laptops, desktops
                  and servers located throughout the world to manage their software
                  licenses, optimize their saas licenses, and to monitor important
                  cybersecurity controls. belarc hosts autodesk's belmanage and
                  belanalytics systems via saas. autodesk uses numerous saas products
                  such as adobe, microsoft o365 and many others. many of these saas
                  vendors do not offer accurate or any usage information on their
                  products that will allow the end-user to optimize their saas license
                  spending. belarc, via our patented usage discovery capability,
                  automatically discovers the usage of these saas and other subscription
                  applications such as usage on all adobe products. this information is
                  critical to optimizing the spend on these saas products.

                  systems.

                  automation
                  




                  belarc's system is based on a cloud architecture using secure web
                  protocols. this allows for a single server and central database for

                  manage and maintain multiple scanners, servers and databases. click
