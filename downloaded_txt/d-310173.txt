welcome to


white hat



                    information about melbourne, australia and the planet which is 
					informed, intelligent, 
					independent and (occasionally) irreverent.
                    






during covid-19 precautions, many events and attractions are cancelled at short notice. 
white hat attempts to monitor these changes but with thousands of listsings on our site this is not always possible.
we recommend checking with the organisers before making a special trip.
