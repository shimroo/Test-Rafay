testimonials 


















delta kits with brent, korey and their whole team are doing things at a high level. delta kits' classes, products, and
            support is bar none from any industry standard. they are the ``disney and ritz carlton`` of their industry. from the
            bottom of my heart thank you, delta, for displaying the character and heart.
every business should take a page from your example. kudos to the whole team especially korey goblin always is available
            and goes the extra mile. you all are top-notch!

i've done business with delta kits for many years and can not recall a time when there was ever an issue.
recently i ordered a couple of items and didn't receive what i ordered correctly. i called the company and they made it
                correct! i may have come across as frustrated or irritated when i called, i'm sorry for that. they were very quick to
                make it correct and sent me the other item. thank you very much!

andrew strouth













i was skeptical about windshield repair when i first did my research, but after contacting korey gobin
                    at delta kits he made a complicated industry make sense to me. a couple of weeks later we met in person, he help me
                    get set up with the networks, and he helped create a customize windshield repair
                        system that fit my company needs.
9 years later and korey is still catering to my needs and helping company grow and become more efficient in every aspect
                of the windshield repair business.
