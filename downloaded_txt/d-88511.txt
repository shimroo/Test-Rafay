introduction 
welcome to are.com.au, this 
		website was designed completely in house.  we have tried our best 
		but fortunately we rely on our sheet metal engineering skills not our 
		i.t. knowledge...
 
aluminium radiators & 
		engineering p/l (trading as are cooling) was established in 1998 to 
		cater for the ever expanding aluminium radiator market.  directors 
		richard and val anderson have over 60 years combined experience in the 
		automotive industry with 40 years of that devoted to engine cooling.
		in 2000 dru garson came on board straight out of his sheet metal work 
		apprenticeship & has stayed with us since, that's 16 years of honing his 
		craft & knowledge.
 
a.r.e. has was established 
		with the aim of providing a high quality product, that although not the 
		cheapest, is designed  and performs to a high standard.  this 
		has been achieved by purchasing high quality fabricating tools and 
		devoting hundreds of hours into r&d.  a.r.e. is a true high 
		performance cooling specialist, all we do is aluminium cooling 
 
repairs
our equipment allow us to do repairs on products that would 
		otherwise have to be replaced.  we can repair (weld/braze) material 
		as thin as the wall of an intercooler/radiator tube. if you have an 
		aluminium radiator or intercooler, that conventional radiator shops 
		can't repair come and see us.
 
 
products
a.r.e. has since broadened it's product range and now produces 
		aluminium radiators, intercoolers, oil coolers and custom fabrications. 
		a.r.e. can fabricate a custom radiator, intercooler or oil cooler to 
		your specifications, with hand crafted sheet metal tanks, which are the 
		result of our substantial r&d program.
 
 hot chilli
        intercoolers
by far however the most popular product in the a.r.e. catalogue is 
		our hot chilli range of 'off the shelf' intercoolers.  
		this range has been continually developed and improved since its 
		introduction in '99.  the cast tank design is the result of hours 
		of r&d, especially  flow bench testing, and now has superior flow,  
		performance and looks.  our hot chilli intercooler range has 
		just been expanded, and now hot chilli's come in both tube and 
		fin and bar and plate cores.
 
trade enquiries welcome
for the first time, with the introduction of our new range a.r.e. 
		can now offer interested companies the ability of becoming a a.r.e. 
		dealer.
