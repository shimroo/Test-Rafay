for over forty years, gary rosenthal led his team of talented craftspeople to produce one of the most popular and unique lines of judaic art in the country, combining copper, brass, and steel with brilliant fused glass. gary created a contemporary style rooted in tradition, inspired by the rich history of the jewish people which tells us it’s a blessing – a mitzvah – to make beautiful, functional, art. in may of 2023, we lost gary, after a valiant four-year battle with pancreatic cancer. throughout his illness he continued to inspire his team and many others with his optimism, energy, and passion for using art to improve lives.today, the gary rosenthal collection continues. led by his son, reuben – who has put his own mark on the collection by adding fine quality wood pieces – and hamilton whitney – grc’s long-time company director – we continue to produce many grc favorites, as well as exciting new creations, which can be found on fine judaica websites and in stores across the country. gary’s mission to use art as a catalyst for good and community building continues as well through the hiddur mitzvah project. the gary rosenthal collection does not sell direct.wholesale accounts may register for an approved login under my account. if you are retail customer you may find many local and online stores that carry our work under store locator. for special commissions, requests, or other questions please feel free to contact us! contact usproduct repair form
