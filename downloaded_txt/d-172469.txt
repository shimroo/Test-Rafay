permalink | comment 3  | share | flagtwo things, for the recordoct. 11th, 2007 | 11:30 pm1) if you want to order a really mean shot for someone's power hour, i recommend the wmd: 1/2 shot wild turkey 101 (but 80 is okay, i guess), 1/2 shot maker's mark, and 1/2 shot dewar's white label, lined up in 3 side-by-side shot glasses, 3 kings-style. "why do you recommend this?" you ask? 1) it will mass destruct your ass; and 2) i fucking invented it. for the record.2) i just painted my room orange. like, home depot orange, except a little redder and warmer. every bit as intense though, especially in the early morning when the sun is directly hitting it. you should come by and check it out. just in case orange suddenly gets trendy (and lord knows it's fucking due to) you heard it here first. i will post pictures as soon as i borrow a digital camera from someone because iphone photos don't do it justice.
permalink | comment 5  | share | flagwiiaug. 14th, 2007 | 12:48 ami bought a wii! it was kind of weird, i was in wal-mart - where i never go unless nothing else is open - to buy some new skin because i cut myself pretty badly bartending tonight, and i thought to myself, "heck, why not go see if they have any wii's."so i did, and they did; 3, the other two of which also sold while i was waiting in line to pay for mine. i haven't even taken it out of the box yet because i have to work really early tomorrow morning, but what a fine end of an otherwise pretty ho-hum day.that is all.
