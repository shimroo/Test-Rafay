the week i spent at camp was a transformative experience. i met and made connections with so many incredible people, and learned about myself as a rower and as a person. in being able to let go of my stress or worries and focus solely on being present in the moment, i made memories and experienced growth that i will hold onto for the rest of my life. ~recent camper

after northeast rowing camp, i feel so much more confident as a coxswain returning to my team for my second year. thanks to the inspiring rowing coaches, wonderful friends i made this week, and especially to our coxswain coach kayleigh, i've gained so much both as a coxswain and as a person! ~ recent coxswain

"i'd first like to say how impressed i was with my overall experience. the camp is extremely well-run and, as an interesting aside, was one of the most relaxing weeks i had all summer! our program consistently recommends northeast but now having experienced it myself, rest assured i will be your biggest cheerleader." -coaching education mentee

“the quality and dedication of the coaching staff, their commitment to the sport, the mentoring they provided and life skills they taught (tenacity, in particular) set the experience apart for my son. great location too!” -parent

"in short, northeast rowing camp has helped me improve all parts of my rowing career from my grip to my posture to my nutrition to my 2k time (i achieved a personal best at camp). there are always things to learn while rowing and the one-on-one attention with the prestigious coaches is a huge step up from being just a single rower in one of five boats my one coach has to train. i attended the camp after my third season of rowing and learned a great deal and refined my stroke. even my younger brother, a complete novice, learned to row and became a decent rower by the end of the week. also, the facility and location are pristine and the food is great! i would recommend northeast rowing camp to any rower, beginner or experienced, looking to become a better oarsman and have fun doing it.”-former camper
