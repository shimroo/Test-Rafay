																	how to maximize the use of old jewelry 															

you now possess a worn-out piece of jewelry you are unsure what to do with. you might seek to improve an old ring you’ve had forever, or you might want to design a unique piece of jewelry and need a small kickstarter budget to get started. how can you get the most money from selling your old jewelry? selling your old estate jewelers might be a terrific way to generate more money. 
 
change it up 
trading in the jewelry you no longer adore will help you get started on the process of buying new jewelry. when you bring your used jewelry to a jeweler, they will frequently evaluate it and give you a purchasing price after determining its condition. the trade-in value that you accept and sell to your jeweler will often be applied toward a new purchase with that jeweler. since jewelers know this would result in a more fabulous buy at their store, you can obtain more out of this strategy than just selling for cash. 
to choose a jeweler you can trust for this process, make sure you conduct thorough research. remember that you’ll probably use this value to obtain something new from the same jeweler, so make sure you like the style they came up with! 
sell straight 
most likely, the most straightforward option to get rid of your outdated jewelry and earn some extra cash is to resell it for money. start by getting an appraisal from a respectable company, but be aware that this will usually cost money. you definitely won’t want to skip it if you’re trying to sell a pricey item, like jewelry or a diamond. 
look for a reputable company to buy. make sure to study the buyer you’re selling to; look up their ratings on google and the bbb, confirm that they have all necessary permits, and get in touch to learn about their company’s appraisal and buying/selling procedure. you ought to have no trouble answering your inquiries with a respectable dealer. 
be aware of what you’re selling 
get a sense of how much gold you have (typically through an evaluation) if you’re selling gold jewelry, for example, so that you can judge how reasonable the offer is for your item. remember to keep your jewelry insured, take pictures, and record the specifications of your piece before selling; doing so may be helpful to you if your piece is misplaced. 
determine the best places to sell your jewelry 
investigate your options to find the approach that works best for you! every method has advantages, disadvantages, and hazards of its own. you may avoid future hassles by doing your homework upfront and understanding where you’ll sell your jewelry and how the process will work. 
establish your timeline 
it’s critical to comprehend your timeline as well. you will probably have fewer options for who will buy your jewels and how much they will pay you if you want to deliver them on the same day. you might be able to negotiate a better bargain for yourself if you had more time. always read the small print and understand how long the procedure will take, how they intend to pay you, and when you may expect to get cash or money in the bank.
