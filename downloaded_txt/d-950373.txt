peabody's wine & beer merchantspeabody's wine & beer merchantspeabody’s wine & beer merchants was established in 1978 and is the region’s—and one of the state's—oldest and most comprehensive bottle shoppes. in addition to the thousands of wine and beer options in stock, we are glad to order from our vast catalog any item we do not have in stock. we are proud to be an inviting, inclusive, and comfortable place to shop, sample or drink wine and cider, taste beer, grab a bite from one of the food trucks, and socialize with friends.
as part of the high country community, peabody’s strives to give back through regular civic engagement, sponsorships, and donations across a broad variety of charities, organizations, and benefits. regular free tastings and events in the store as well as collaborations and partnerships with local organizations and businesses also help strengthen our community. we are very grateful for the support that has allowed peabody's to celebrate its 44th year in business.come see us!address1104 highway 105 southboone, nc, 28607phone828-264-9476call ahead and curbside pickup are available.emailkevin@peabodyswineandbeer.comsend us an email!hoursmonday9am - 9pm tuesday9am - 9pmwednesday9am - 9pmthursday9am - 9pmfriday9am - 10pmsaturday9am - 10pmsunday12pm - 9pm
