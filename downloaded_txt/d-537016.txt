jewish people are picking hybrid long term care insurance over traditional 


updated march 29, 2022 with new information. 
when you get to a place in your life when you need to start planning your finances for post-retirement, it’s good to know all of your choices. many jewish people are unaware that you are able to get multiple benefits combined into one product. this is called a hybrid policy, or secure care if you purchase through securian. there are many other companies offering this style of long-term care products as well.
the topic is getting recent attention in jewish media sources.
most jewish people were unaware that these hybrid long term care insurance plans were available until recently at this jewish long term care summit.  the hybrid long term care insurance products have popped up in the past five years to now be the fastest growing ltc product series out there. 
another recent article in ajt discusses the topic of long-term care planning and how insurance can fit in, as well.
if you have never heard of this type of policy, it is much different from a basic life insurance policy. think of it as a “bundle” rather than a single policy.
if you are unsure about your options or eligibility, you can submit a form with your information and request a custom proposal from the company. they will use the information you’re provided with your requests and needs and show you the options and features you can choose from.
all companies’ products can differ slightly, but one thing securian has is flexibility, freedom for their clients. they also guarantee 3 things: that your long-term care will be covered, your beneficiaries will receive the money in the event that you do not end up needing your long-term care, and the option to get a refund of your premiums if you change your mind.
who is the best hybrid long-term care provider?
finding a company that allows you to compare all of the major plans is the best way to see all of your options.  a few examples of places you can find quotes include ltc tree’s hybrid comparison service, local brokers and agents, and even contacting your state’s insurance commissioner office to find resources.  most states will have options and know who sells hybrid long-term care insurance policies.
important things to look out for:
the flexibility this policy provides is extremely beneficial for unknown circumstances. you can customize your coverage in a few different ways. one of them being to receive a monthly acceleration of your death benefit for up to 3 years. you can also add an extension of long-term care benefits up to 7 years. this policy also protects you from rising costs, whereas most simple life policies have unpredictable premiums.
they also give jewish people the freedom, to choose how they receive your long-term care. some of these options are: adult day care, home modification, informal care, assisted living, caregiver training, hospice, nursing home care, bed reservation, home health care, household services, respite care and benefits outside the u.s.
securian provides a more extensive brochure that helps you understand your options as well as pricing and other important information. visit their site to get more information.

countries

countries with the largest jewish population 


it is obvious which country has the largest jewish population. however, there may be a surprise in this list. the statistics in this roundup are supported by the jewish virtual library which is a project of american-israeli cooperative enterprise referred to as aice. there is an estimate of more than thirteen million jewish people across the globe, though the largest population is in israel.
many of those who practiced jewish faith were dispersed from their homelands during the years of persecution and anti-semitism. most sought refuge in other countries in europe. they were dispersed again during the world wars. below is a roundup of the countries with the largest jewish population.
1.     israel
israel has an estimate of 6,014,000 jews. they make up 75 percent of the population in israel and also the largest jewish population in the globe. the origin of israel in 1948 led to the mass immigration of jews into the country. israel has arabs and muslims as well as it located on palestinians territories.
2.     united states of america
the usa takes the second position after israel with a population of approximately 5,425,000 jews. what lies behind this population is the fact that majority of jews who resided in the european countries fled to the usa because they were discriminated. the united states of america was a suitable place where they could freely practice their religious rituals and express themselves without being discrimination as it was in europe in the 20th century.
the ashkenazi makes the largest jewish population in america with approximately 90 percent; they’re the jewish diaspora population which originates from the jews who settled along rhine river which lies in northern france and western germany.
3.     france
france has an approximate of 478,000 jewish population. there are mainly found in paris, lyon, marseille, and toulouse regions. many french jews suffered from anti-semitism, but most of them managed to survive the holocaust. they later migrated to france from the french colonies of north africa and mediterranean in the 19th century. currently, the mizrahi and sephardi jews are the majority.
4.     canada
canada takes the fourth slot with a jewish population of 380,000. most jewish in canada are mainly found in quebec, ontario, alberta, manitoba, and british columbia. canada has a diverse pool of doctrines of jewish faith such as the canadian jews of sephardi, mizrahi, and ashkenazi background are welcomed there.
besides, the first jews in canada were from of british origin who served in the british army. they immigrated to canada due to the terrible anti-sematic crime practiced against them in europe.
5.     united kingdom
the united kingdom has a population of 290,000 jews. it takes the second largest europe country with jewish population after france. the first jews in britain around in 1070 and were indefinitely banned from the country of 200 years. they were then allowed resettlement in the uk in the 19th century.
in the 21st century, everyone is free to practice his or her faith. all prospects of all regions showing tolerance, support, and respect are encouraged.

judaism

issues facing modern judaism today 


while in the previous generation conservative judaism was the largest and most dynamic in the denominational jewish spectrum. besides, orthodox in 2000 had transformed into one of the fastest growing jewish movements in america. the orthodox jews have a lot to be thankful for. one, it is a beautiful and thriving community of singles and married, young and old, retirees and working professionals and people from all backgrounds. however, there still issues that threaten to undermine judaism.
zionism
zionism doesn’t have a uniform ideology. it has evolved into a dialogue among a disjoint collection of ideologies which include: revisionist zionism, labor zionism, green zionism, religious zionism, and general zionism. furthermore, not every jew is a zionist. in fact, only a few know what zionism actually means. it is not mandatory to be a zionist and being a non-zionist doest mean that you are the same as an anti-zionist; it means that you don’t accept all the basics of being a zionist. the issue that the zionists create for the non-zionists is that in some case zionist paint all jews as zionist. this makes muslims hate jews even if they’re not zionist.
racism
jews come in many languages, colors, and with diverse menus. a lot of jews forget that. besides, most people fail to remember the horrific and terrible battle in israel, after 1948, to make yiddish the official language of israel; or the numerous attempts to prevent falash from having infants from the state-sanctioned chemical de-fertilization of women.
standards
the explanation of what it means to keep kosher varies among jews in today’s world. however, lots of jews have started to question whether it is to only uphold standards of how you should kill an animal – the tradition states that the animal should be subjected to as little pain as possible. instead, some jews have started asking if they should kill animals at all. and for jews who consume meat, how can they know if the animal has been treated well during its entire life?

judaism

how to convert to judaism 


the process of converting to judaism requires penetration of the innermost character as well as spiritual being, and demanding a thorough examination of one’s behavior and other things which can culminate in the conversion to a brand-new identity. besides, due to the consequences to both the convert’s psyche and to jewish people – especially at times when the conversion to judaism was barred by most ruling powers – rabbis always urge those who want to convert to consider their motivations.
step by step of the conversion process
step 1 – learning
candidates who are willing to convert to judaism are encouraged to learn extensively about jewish culture and religion, to know a variety of jewish practices and to converse with a rabbi in the process. you will begin by enrolling in judaism 101 or introduction to judaism classes, which are mostly offered at jewish community centers, synagogues, and other institutions related to jewish.
if you find an institution and comes into terms with a rabbi that you are ready for conversion, the formal procedure starts.
step 2 – circumcision
if you are male, the very first step is undergoing circumcision or brit milahs. if you are circumcised, you go through a ritual extraction of a drop of blood known as hatafat dam brit. the reform and reconstructionist rabbis provide you with a choice regarding hataft dam brit in case you are circumcised.
step 3 – rabbinic court (beit din)
after circumcision has completely healed, a rabbinic court is then assembled. this is a 3-person court that is comprised of one rabbi and two observant jews who have a deep knowledge of the laws of conversion. the court determines your sincerity by evaluating your motivation, knowledge, and your intentions to live as a jew.
furthermore, for traditional jews, you must first ascent to the kabbalat ol ha-mitzvot, that is the acceptance of the yoke of commandments – the willingness to live under the validity and commitment to the performance of the commandments. liberal rabbis ask for a commitment to perform the selected commandments.
step 4 – ritual bath (mikveh)
after the court is assured the convert’s sincerity, the convert then immerses into a mikveh or a ritual pool, as well as an ocean or the lake if the ritual pool is unavailable. in other cases, a swimming pool can be used although only specific non-orthodox authorities allow a swimming pool. the water is usually symbolic of liminality, or the in-between state, of the candidate. the immersion referred to as tevillah cleanses the convert of the past misdeeds and prepares the candidate for a different destiny and future.
following the immersion, the convert is then officially considered a jew and can now recite legitimately the blessing for immersion which involves the words ‘who has sanctified us with the commandments.’
step 5 – hebrew name
now the convert takes a hebrew name. however, the name only isn’t sufficient to find someone in the jewish tradition. when the jews are summoned to the torah, or to sign legal documents, their parents’ names are included in their hebrew name to find them in the jewish spiritual space. traditionally, the convert adopts braham and sara as their spiritual parents and in legal instances is known as ‘ben avraham avinu’, also known as ‘son of our father, abraham, as well as ‘bat sarah imenu’ also known as ‘the daughter of our mother, sarah.’
step 6 – post conversion period
life after conversion can be challenging. this is because the convert is required to reestablish your relations with your birth parents and develop new ones with the newly acquired jewish families. however, with persistence, patience, and the realization that the e
the process of converting to judaism requires penetration of the innermost character as well as spiritual being, and demanding a thorough examination of one’s behavior and other things which can culminate in the conversion to a brand-new identity. besides, due to the consequences to both the convert’s psyche and to jewish people – especially at times when the conversion to judaism was barred by most ruling powers – rabbis always urge those who want to convert to consider their motivations.

bible

what does the bible say about tattoos? 


tattoos are now popular than ever. they have become widely accepted in the western culture, particularly among the youth. so, what does the bible say about tattoos?
the old testament law in leviticus 19:28 says, “you shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead or tattoo any marks upon you: i am the lord.” this is the only instance where the bible mentions tattoos. god gave this command to israel which set them apart from their neighbors who market their skins with symbols or names of their gods.
a lot of people believe that this verse prohibits against tattoos only in the context of specific pagan practices. according to them, the tattoos referred in leviticus are those that are for dead – using tattoos in an attempt to persuade the gods to help the dead in the afterlife. others take the leviticus verse to be a general prohibition against tattooing by the wording of the verse.
1 peter 3:3–4: says, “your beauty should not come from outward adornments, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in god’s sight.” this verse is directed to christian women and there is a principle which may concern, though indirectly, tattoos. according to this verse, one’s external appearance shouldn’t look be the main focus of your attention.
many women focus on having fine clothes and elaborate hairstyle, and jewelry, but that isn’t where the true beauty lies. likewise, body piercing and tattoos are an outward adornment and we should not give it more effort to the development of ‘inner self’, regardless of our gender.
since the bible does not directly forbid tattoos, we do know our body isn’t our own but god’s temple. the bible has a high view of one’s body as god’s image, which should not be disfigured. so, before getting tattooed, we should ask ourselves how much we can modify our bodies to accomplish our desires while not disfiguring our bodies as god made them.
furthermore, the bible advises us to consider the motive of getting a tattoo. according to ephesians 6:1-3; if it’s in rebellion to parents, it’s not acceptable. 1 corinthians 10:31 teaches that while self-expressing yourself artistically is fine, your primary motive for anything that we do is to glorify god. this means that we should seek honor and draw attention to him, not ourselves.
proverbs 21:5 says that “the plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage, but everyone that is hasty surely heads for want.” most people decide to get a tattoo hastily, yet it can pose a negative long-term impact on employment and relationships. additionally, tattoos are painful and costly to remove.
some desire to establish their independence or identity, while others get a tattoo to assert the ownership of their body. however, romans 12:1 says, “present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to god, a sacred service with your power of reason.” use the power of reason to know why you want a tattoo. if it is because of peer pressure or wants to show off to your friends, know that your feelings can be less permanent than the tattoo.

tattoos

things to consider before getting a tattoo 


a tattoo is a nice way of expiring yourself through body art, however, you should know that committing to a tattoo is a big decision. the decisions you make in getting a tattoo last a life time. or as long as it takes you to save for laser removal surgery. the trick is not only to know what to be inked on your back but also to ensure the work is fantastic. so, we have prepared a list of the top things you should consider before getting a tattoo.
1.     know what you want
tattoos are permanent, meaning whatever gets on your body will be there for a very long time, unless you consider going through the painful laser removal process. therefore, your tattoo should be really something that you really want on your body. ensure the tattoo is something you will still want to have when you are on the late 40s or 50s.
2.     placement
the placement of the tattoo is also important as what you get. some parts of your body are far more painful than others. besides, some locations can give you more judgmental looks than others. you will also get to consider the placement based on your place of work. for example, in the conservative workplaces, displaying tattoos is prohibited. if you aren’t sure of the placement, consider getting a temporary stencil on the body parts you’re considering so that you can see how it looks.
3.     research
do your research. ensure you know your tattoo artist and your shop. a good shop isn’t hard to find, and when you do, make sure you trust your artists. just like a doctor, most artists know what they are doing or saying, meaning when they give you advice on placement, color schemes, design, or size, it is for a reason.
4.     timing
water submersion and sun exposure can damage a new tattoo. if you are a beach bum, it is advisable that you avoid getting a tattoo in summer. early autumn and spring are most practical. you will not burn but you can also leave any leg or arm tattoos exposed rather covering them with fabric which might be irritating.
5.     make an appointment
a lot of shops accept walk-ins but many are by appointment only, especially the classy shops. besides, even if you know of a walk-in place, you may consider making an appointment, more so if it is your first tattoo. an appointment gives you enough time to speak with the artist and a little time to think about it.
6.     know your pain tolerance
tattoos can really hurt. you might consider getting a little numb after a while so that the pain can decrease when the adrenaline kicks in. we have all seen people crying when getting a tattoo while others may scream. it depends on your pain tolerance and the location of the tattoo. some body parts are more painful than others. for instance, the softer areas may not hurt very much.
7.     use visual aid
you may want to supply a visual example of what you desire. even if you artist is the one customizing the design for you, attend the appointment with inspiration. in case you want a particular text used, bring the chosen works in that font. if you have seen an exact tattoo you want online, ensure you bring it. furthermore, print versions are great, as the artist can use it in creating a transfer or a stencil.
