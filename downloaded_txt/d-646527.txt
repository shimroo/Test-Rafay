earth data / the musical is an original science-driven show created by theater arts at caltech and performed by a team of engineers, technologists, researchers, and local artists. inspired by jpl's "blended worlds" for the getty's pst art: art and science collide, earth data / the musical is informed by the real-life research of nasa jpl climate scientists, dr. kimberley rain miner and dr. bradley gay.this musical follows a young postdoc, mab, and her uncle, jj: scientists working at the prestigious research lab, the consilience institute to understand the changing climate and its effects. as they pursue their research and learn to understand one another, they face off against the balsurab energy corporation. when mab's groundbreaking research implicates balsurab, mab is called before congress to testify about climate change and defend her laboratory's crucial work, testing her convictions. will the team at consilience risk their lab's funding to bring their research to the public's attention? will they be able to communicate their discoveries to a fractured public, plagued by misinformation? can they come together to fight for the earth's survival and celebrate science as a human endeavor?
