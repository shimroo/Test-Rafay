about office








"dear red raiders, colleagues, and friends:
welcome to the new summer/fall issue of global connections! in this edition, we’re thrilled to provide an in-depth look at internationalization efforts across campus, our lubbock community and beyond while we showcase our diverse body of students, faculty, and staff and continue to celebrate our complex, interconnected humanities.
as part of the red raider family and ttu extended network, you bring invaluable perspectives to our magazine, and thus, we invite you to stay connected with us and share your stories, experiences, and accomplishments.
with the holidays approaching, we would like to thank you for your continued support to international affairs during this year and to wish you a joyful season, a restful winter break and a prosperous 2025!"
dr. elizabeth trejos castillo, vice provost for international affairs
