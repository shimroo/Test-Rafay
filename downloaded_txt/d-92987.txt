from the 1967 chevrolet camaro coupe to the 2002 anniversary edition to a 650hp supercharged beast, from pace cars to z28's, iroc-z's, ss's, rs's 1le's and zl1's the history of the chevy camaro has been a wild ride. fast, fun and fabulous!
the first chevrolet camaros started rolling off the assembly line and into 
    dealerships in late 1966, gm's answer to the mustang. more than 220,000 were 
    sold in this introductory year, including over 25,000 convertibles. base price 
    for a 6-cylinder coupe was slightly more than $2400.00. this "first generation" 
    of camaros lasted from 1967 to 1969 and introduced the z28 to the automotive 
    world. 1970 to 1981 saw the "second generation" and the loss of 
    the convertible option although t-tops were available from 1978 on. for the 
    1982 model year, the camaro was re-styled and the "third generation" 
    was born. the "fourth generation" started in 1993 and has continued 
    until the announcement of the discontinuation of the camaro line in 2002. 
    there were no camaros produced for model years 2003 to 2009. however, in march of 2009 chevrolet started production on a new "fifth generation" camaro for the 2010 model year which lasted until 2015. production of the "sixth generation" camaro started in november of 2015 for the 2016 model year and is currently still being produced.
the last 50 plus years have seen many changes in the camaro line, but the one 
  thing that hasn't changed has been the fact that it is one of the powerhouses 
  of the muscle car world. camaros are seen in shows across the country in every 
  condition from a pristine, numbers-matching '68 rally-sport convertible to 
  a full blown 1970 pro-street modified car. they bear names like yenko, dana 
  and baldwin/motion. they've been passenger cars, pace cars and police cars. 
  big block or small block, the camaro has been a force to reckon with since 
  its conception.
