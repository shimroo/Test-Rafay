tplo surgery for dogs in 2024: insights from veterinarian dr. kelly burdette

    management  uncategorized 


dr kelly burdette owner of puffnstuffcockapoos.com and tcvccares.com
dr. kelly burdette, cockapoo breeder, and dedicated veterinarian with years of experience in orthopedic surgery, sheds light on tplo (tibial plateau leveling osteotomy) surgery for dogs. tplo is a surgical procedure commonly used to treat cranial cruciate ligament (ccl) injuries in dogs. in this article, dr. burdette will discuss key facts about tplo surgery, its benefits, and what pet owners can expect during and after the procedure.

what is tplo surgery? tplo surgery is a specialized orthopedic procedure designed to stabilize the knee joint in dogs suffering from ccl injuries. the cranial cruciate ligament is essential for knee joint stability, and when it’s damaged, tplo surgery can help restore normal function.
why tplo over other options? dr. burdette often recommends tplo surgery over other techniques because it alters the biomechanics of the knee joint, reducing the need for a functioning ccl. unlike some other surgeries, tplo doesn’t rely on the ligament’s integrity, making it a more reliable option for long-term joint stability.
indications for tplo: tplo surgery is typically recommended for medium to large-breed dogs, as they are more prone to ccl injuries. signs that your dog might need tplo surgery include limping, lameness, and difficulty walking or standing.
the surgical procedure: during tplo surgery, dr. burdette carefully modifies the angle of the tibial plateau to minimize joint instability. this involves creating a crescent-shaped cut in the tibia and rotating the top portion to achieve the desired angle. the bone is then secured with plates and screws to maintain the corrected position.
benefits of tplo surgery:



improved joint stability: tplo surgery restores stability to the knee joint, alleviating pain and allowing for a better quality of life.
faster recovery: compared to some other surgical methods, tplo often results in a quicker and smoother recovery for dogs.
reduced arthritis risk: by stabilizing the knee joint, tplo surgery can help reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis.


post-surgery care: dr. burdette emphasizes the importance of post-surgery care. this typically involves restricted activity, physical therapy, and pain management to ensure a successful recovery. regular follow-up appointments with the veterinarian are crucial to monitor progress.
success rates: tplo surgery has a high success rate in terms of restoring mobility and relieving pain in dogs with ccl injuries. most dogs experience significant improvement in their overall quality of life after undergoing this procedure.
consultation with a veterinarian: dr. kelly burdette strongly advises pet owners to consult with a qualified veterinarian to determine the best treatment plan for their dogs. each case is unique, and a thorough examination and discussion of options are essential.

conclusion: tplo surgery is a valuable orthopedic procedure that can significantly improve the lives of dogs suffering from ccl injuries. dr. kelly burdette’s expertise highlights the importance of seeking professional guidance when considering this surgery. with the right care and attention, dogs can enjoy a pain-free, active life after tplo surgery. source: dr. kelly burdette of www.tcvccares.com helps dogs from all over the nation for such surgeries. visit tcvccares.com today!

most 3pl companies support the iot and its impact on the whole industry.

 published:    / updated:   management  uncategorized 



finding a good lawyer means that you always have a better chance of winning your case in court. for that, if you have been sued for domestic violence, the first thing you will need to do is find a good domestic violence lawyer that can represent you accordingly. however, the lawyer should not have a bad rapport with their previous clients.
 
here are other factors you should look for in a domestic violence attorney;
 
1. honesty
 
you need to work with a professional, who will be honest with you in what they do. they should not only do their job perfectly, but they should be honest at all times as well. if they don’t understand something, they should be open and tell you so.
 
2. they are polite
 
if you are a domestic violence defendant, you will want to work with someone that counters your anger if you have that issue. if the lawyer that you deal with is not polite, they might provoke you, which might then lead to an expected burst up.
 
3. they are empathetic
 
just because you are dealing with a lawyer doesn’t mean that they are angels. they are also humans, and they could have been involved in almost a similar situation in their life. the lawyer should be in a position to make you feel like you are talking to a friend that understands your situation, who is willing to help you.
 
 
 
 
4. non-judgmental
no attorney should jump into conclusion without understanding what when on. even if they find out that you were guilty, they should never try to judge you. as a matter of fact, the judge will be doing that. that is why you need work with a lawyer that will not judge you for being involved in domestic violence.
 
 
5. smart and official

how to save when dealing with recruitment agencies

    management  uncategorized 



working with a headhunter is the wisest way to handle the hiring process of your company. these recruitment firms have enough resources and skills to help you find the right candidate for your vacant position. they don’t come cheaply, but there’s still a way to save the cost of hiring a recruitment agency. here are some tips to help you save when dealing with a headhunter.
 
1. use the right online search tool
 
thanks to the advanced technology, you can now search for the best recruitment agency without the need for walking around. there are plenty of free online search tools that will help you find the right recruitment agency that matches your business’ niche such as “life science“. this helps you save time, money, and effort.
 
2. determine your needs/goals
 
you should have well-defined needs that are flexible, and reasonable enough. if your business has unrealistic goals, it would be difficult for the recruitment agency to find you the right candidate. on the other hand, it would save you time and cost you less if the goals are flexible and achievable.
 
3. pick the right headhunter
 
when you are out looking for a recruiter, you need to be sure that you find the right agency. some recruitment agencies will offer their services to specific businesses this way, it might be difficult to find one that covers your industry. if the recruitment agency doesn’t cover your industry, it would cost you more money and time to get your ideal candidate. on the other hand, an agency that covers multiple industries gives you a better chance to succeed in your hiring needs.

 
4. find the right payment option
 
you need to understand that there are different payment options when you are dealing with the recruitment agencies. some will offer a flat rate per hire, others will offer a retainer payment, while others combine the two. a flat rate per hire is typically when you pay for the services once you get your ideal candidate. a retainer is where you pay a fee for the recruitment firm to find you the right candidate, and they will be typically your official headhunters. ensure that you choose the right payment/hiring option that meets your company’s needs.
 
 
always ensure that you go for a recruitment agency that has a good track record, and one that deals with multiple industries.
 
newport search- executive headhunters is a leading executive life science recruitment agency that covers different industries to give every company the chance to get the perfect candidate. they are reliable, experienced, and generally efficient. they also give you a flexible payment option, which is a better way to enjoy their services regardless of your budget.
