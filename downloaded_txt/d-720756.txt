chicago area professional carseat safety checkup service


expert child safety seat installation service serving dupage and most of cook county since 2004, the first and most reliable professional car seat checkup service in illinois, plus virtual shopping consults nationwide.

thank you to all my clients for over 20 years in business!  due in part to anti-small-business practices in the city of naperville, i regret that seatcheck will temporarily close for business, effective november 22, 2024.  at this time, i do not know if business will re-open in 2025.  this seatcheck.net domain name and/or website may be for sale in 2025, please contact me.
to schedule an inspection in the chicago area, please visit the car seat installation page*.  seatcheck’s fitting station is located in northeast naperville and by appointment only.  no waiting to see someone at a police or fire station, we also offer convenient mobile service right to your home or office.  i also offer expert virtual one-on-one consultations nationwide to answer car seat related questions or to select the right car seat for you. i have helped parents select and install thousands of car seats from britax, chicco, graco, nuna and almost every other brand.
seatcheck is a local small business, owned and operated by a child passenger safety technician with well over 20 years of experience and focusing only on car seat installations and instruction.  your child’s safety will never be left to an inexperienced contractor, newly-trained employee or third party.  experienced, certified and insured service from the owner at every appointment!  don’t settle for someone who is rushed to re-install your seat as quickly as possible after cleaning your upholstery or providing another service.  every seatcheck full-service appointment is up to one hour exclusively on car seat installation and follows safest practice guidelines, including tips and education so you can do-it-yourself in the future.  never pay more for a shorter “virtual” video checkup from a random agent with unknown credentials!

are your kids safe? many parents think they have installed their child safety seat correctly, but according to the cdc, 72% of child restraint systems installed have at least one critical misuse that could be expected to increase a child’s risk of injury during a crash.  is your child riding in one of them?   please browse our information and links to make sure your kids are safe.  why seatcheck?  get the peace of mind to know your kids are protected.  schedule an appointment for a professional carseat checkup and have a certified technician make sure you are installing and using your child safety seats correctly!
for over 20 years, seatcheck has been offering its own expert car seat installations with travel service to your home or office in naperville, the west suburbs and some of chicago.  please see the installation page for a list of communities in the service area. i also offer virtual car seat consultations to answer questions and help select the right car seat for you.  seatcheck is not supported by taxpayer dollars or any other agency or organization.

seatcheck is a part-time small business and appointments times are limited. winter appointments, when available, are tentative, subject to cancellation for weather conditions, and usually not available when temperatures are below 40 degrees.  i book all appointments personally by call, text, whatsapp or email.  this is to make sure correct car seats are available and there is enough time for instruction.  i apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your understanding and support of a local small business.
please visit my installation service page or car seat shopping consult page for more details on my child safety seat instruction services, and for contact information to schedule an appointment!  no walk-ins or drive-ups, sorry, all services by appointment only.  winter services are very limited.
