bike + barge
our bike and barge tours throughout europe are the best way to travel and will be an experience you will never forget! the bike is your means to pedal the back roads of countries and cultures and the boat is your unique accommodations throughout your tour. 







 






bike + hotel
our bike tours in europe, asia, and beyond are as varied as you are. we have self-guided, guided, and supported bicycle tours, with most now offering the electric bike option. 







 






hiking + walking

passion for travel

we love to travel and we love to share. a genuine passion for cycling fueled our inception and now this passion continues to fuel our vision. we believe that travel should be more than business, it should be a way of life. for us, travel is not indulging, it is engaging with people, cultures, and destinations that are foreign to our own.



quality

the opportunity to explore and discover should be available to more than just a few. we offer quality and economy and our partners are as passionate as we are. they know their own backyards and love to walk you through them. as a marketplace, we can offer many choices, to many different types of travelers, to many destinations, and we stand by each and every one.



customer service

we are travelers helping travelers. in the office, we have seasoned travelers and those who have only one or two stamps in their passports. we have those who want every detail ironed out before they go and others who go with the flow. we understand. from giving personal advice before you depart to providing assistance when you are traveling, we are dedicated to making your journey as seamless as possible. service is at the heart of everything we do and everything we are.
