i'm shocked that even after the footage of it we saw, some people are still convinced mario kart 9 is gonna have nintendo crossover characters

maybe im the crazy one, but i would've thought if nintendo went the smash kart route it wouldn't still have the same rough roster balance of 8deluxe with 80% mario 20% other. it'd be the focus right? the balance would be more... balanced.

i also thought the wonder-esce art style would be enough for deconformation, they wouldn't make a wonder-styled link or captain falcon.

again maybe i'm crazy but i think the nintendo kart ship has sunk, i don't think it's happening

mario kart 8's artstyle was broad and realistic and could work with pretty much any character ever. 9's is way more specific and founded in replicating a certain 2d mario artstyle similar to wonder.

honestly i don't even want crossover dlc to become a standard for mario kart, you could do so much more interesting things than giving us the same characters in every dlc drop. i don't want a tradition of "dlc time! time to buy inkling for the 12th time!"

didn't sakurai cover a video on making cartoon characters and realistic characters mix well together in smash by altering their designs, like giving sonic slightly more realistic fur and adjusting bayonetta's proportions for example?

seeing the guests redesigned in the wonder art style would make them more interesting to see return, wouldn‚Äôt it? i can‚Äôt really imaging them making a wonder styled zelda game for example, so this would be our only chance to see that. i don‚Äôt know if it would look good, but i‚Äôm at least curious.

i've only seen like 3 episodes of spongebob in my life, and the only way i survive this largely spongebob centric world we live in is through cultural osmosis and stuff.

just saw a figure in an episode of "the super mario bros. super show" who looks awfully like wario...even though his debut was 3 years away.

it's really funny to think that once people were legitimately convinced a super bowl was going to play royalty free associated production music.

they should do that though. bell hop (a) would be a real throwback to the og american sports.

oh hold on, am i that old now? this is a long story, sooooo...

when stephen hillenburg died, spongebob fans started a petition to get sweet victory to play at the super bowl. the nfl joined in and teased it, but it turned out to just be a brief spongebob animation preceding sicko mode.

wait did sweet victory use a royalty free backing track or something

wario wario wario
no, the song including vocals is royalty free - not public domain, there's still a fee, but it's a one-time and typically low fee.
