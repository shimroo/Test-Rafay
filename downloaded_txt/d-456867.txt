ed stauffer, our founder february 24, 1938 - june 25, 2022we are an international fellowship of fire-rescue chaplains. from here you can learn about us, check out the news of the ffc, explore membership, and access our training schedule.

the mission of the federation of fire chaplains is to bring
together persons interested in providing an effective chaplain service: to give
aid, comfort and help to firefighters and their families; to work toward the
betterment of all areas of the fire and emergency service; to serve god, to aid
humanity, our communities, our governments, our religions, our countries and
the quality of life; to help mankind in developing their most noble characteristic-that
of serving others; to help bring about a better understanding among all people
with mutual harmony and respect regardless of one’s level of authority; and to
achieve a single healing, unifying spirit of love for god and each other.
the federation of fire chaplains is non-sectarian and calls
for no compromise of either individual beliefs or convictions. our first
responsibility is to god, second, to humanity.
as fire chaplains, our work is not limited to the area of
fire departments, firefighters, communities nor victims of the devastating
ravages of fire or other crises; we shall strive to help ease the suffering of
our fellow human beings wherever our paths shall lead. however, as a base for
our work, we have chosen the fire service.
the members of the federation of fire chaplains believe by
bringing persons together to provide an effective response to crisis
situations, through training and responding, we will be able to achieve the
goal of serving god and humanity in the work of the chaplain.
this, with god’s help, we will strive to do._________________________________federation of fire chaplainscode of conduct_________________________________

to console those who mourn,
to give them  beauty for ashes...

he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to


 succeed.  ecclesiastes 10:10
as iron sharpens iron,
so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
