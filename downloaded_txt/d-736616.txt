welcome to hober thinking radio - unvarnished folk music from around the world.


coming to you from the apple orchard in new england, usa.


 thank you for listening.

 




hober is now closed. the audience has long since departed for newer/better music listening experiences using more modern technology. certainly in the 90's hober.com was important, in some small way, to the early development of the internet. this site is left as a historical document.
