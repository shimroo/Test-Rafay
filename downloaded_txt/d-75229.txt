                        i applied for the ibro parenthood grant because i wanted to keep my research going while on maternity leave. i didn’t want any gender-based or mother-related stereotypes affecting my academic productivity. this grant played a crucial role in enabling me to prioritize the care of my newborn, by addressing other challenges that were exacerbated by my personal situation.

                        the students have been very appreciative of the school. they remarked that it was an enriching experience that exposed them to a wide array of conceptual ideas, new methodologies, and cutting-edge experimental techniques. an additional benefit they noted is the long-lasting friendships that have been formed during the program.

ibro journals
ibro’s journals, neuroscience and ibro neuroscience reports, serve as main outlets for the publication of impactful, excellent research and are also essential for ibro’s global neuroscience activities, as more than 90% of the organization’s initiatives are funded by proceeds from both journals.
