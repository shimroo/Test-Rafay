gary demarrachel held evans (1981-2019) was a christian columnist, blogger, and author who supported same-sex marriage because “jesus never talked about it.” this is a frequent argument for supporters of same-sex marriage and the lgbtq+ agenda. she also stated that the creeds don’t mention anything about homosexuality. so here we are today where “the town of worcester, massachusetts, voted to become a ‘sanc [...]holding government accountable (it's in the constitution)february 12, 2025

the written constitution “checks” the powers of the federal government by carefully delineating and specifying the powers of each branch. if the constitution does not grant the federal government power to perform a particular activity, the government cannot legally perform it: “the powers not delegated to the united states by th [...]the question doge should be askingfebruary 11, 2025

gary demarthe question that the department of government efficiency (doge) should be asking is under what constitutional provision does the u.s. agency for international development (usaid) derive its authority? some might point to the preamble and the general welfare clause in the body of the constitution:

moral questions can only be answered in terms of ultimate presuppositions. what are the preconditions for morality? where does the atheist go to account for his moral worldview? why should i be concerned about the poor if darwin’s “survival of the fittest” is fundamental to the undebatable theory? raising moral ques [...]episode 26: modern-day gaza is not a prophetic fulfillmentfebruary 07, 2025

no matter what happens in the middle east—good, bad, or indifferent—it is claimed to be a fulfillment of bible prophecy.
the bible shows that the events described in matthew 24 were fulfilled in the first century and fell upon the generation of jews who “did not recognize the time of [their] visitation” (luke 19:44) and crucified “the lord of glory” ( [...]jesuits, jehovah's witnesses, and preterismfebruary 06, 2025
by
gary demarone of the arguments used against a preterist interpretation of revelation is that it was developed by spanish jesuit luis de alcazar (1554-1613) who wrote a commentary titled vestigio arcani sensus in apocaplysi or investigation of the hidden sense of the apocalypse and was published a year after his death. “in this work dedicated to the catholic church, he made a new attempt to interpret the apo [...]a lightning round of newsfebruary 05, 2025

american visiongary runs through a few recent news stories and how the media is struggling to keep up with everything happening.
the bible directs us to submit to every human institution but with certain limitations. “whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right” (1 peter 2:13). while peter has civil authority in mi [...]does “postmillennialism” require preterism?february 04, 2025
by
gary demarsomeone on facebook asking the following question: “can one be … postmillennial while rejecting partial preterism?” for a robust postmillennialism (a moniker i do not like), a person needs to be a preterist, even if it’s an inconsistent preterism. revelation 20 should not be used in defense of what is labeled “postmillennialism” since there’s little in the chapter that describes what postmillennia [...]how theological differences should be handledfebruary 03, 2025

american visiongary responds to a recent article by ken gentry that called gary out for his views on eschatology.
the nicene creed and its anonymous cousin, the apostles’ creed, have been standards of orthodoxy for around 1700 years. a charge made by some christians who ask questions about the creeds is that the creeds use “man’s language,” thus invalidating their authority. this is a harsh and mistaken claim si [...]episode 25: what about progressive dispensationalism?january 31, 2025

american visionbible prophecy under the microscope-episode 25
gary answers a listener question about progressive dispensationalism.
for centuries, theologians declared that the papacy was the biblical antichrist, the man of lawlessness, and the beast all rolled into one. i have several books in my library that take this view. for example, richard hurd’s chapter “prophecies concerning antichrist” in his book an i [...]gary's state of the unionjanuary 29, 2025

gary demari’m not at all ok with “happy birthday jesus” signs during advent season. biblical christology includes the incarnation, but the birth of the god-man is not like our birth. the reaction of the magi, herod, and simeon and anna are signposts of what transpired when “the word became flesh and dwelt among us” (john 1:14). there were theological, political, and kingdom consequences. the christian faith [...]deconstruction and the christian faithjanuary 27, 2025

by
american visionthe following article was written by david chilton (1951-1997) in 1984. american vision was a very new christian ministry. i don’t remember how we got the contract to write power for living for the 1983 “year of the bible” campaign, but we completed the project on time and on budget. what you are about to read is indicative of what the church has been facing for more than 40 years. — gary demar [...]atheism has no mindjanuary 22, 2025

american visiongary explains the interaction he had on facebook with a former pastor who has since deconverted.
there is no such thing as “human dignity” or “rights” given the operating assumptions of today’s secular religion of evolution. as richard dawkins put it, “the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is at the bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good. nothin [...]does ‘gary demarr’ know “squat” about bible prophecy?january 21, 2025

gary discusses genesis 6 and the whole “sons of god” controversy and how it gets tied in with bible prophecy.
