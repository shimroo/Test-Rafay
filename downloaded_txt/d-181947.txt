the rapture notecardmodel: rapnc
condition: new
 
the rapture
1 thessalonians 4:13-18
matthew 24:40
 
rapture is a word that means “a gathering up” and it is used by christians to refer to the time when jesus will return to the earth to gather all his believers up to him.
the dead will rise first, from graves, from the depths of the seas, or wherever their bodies rested whether whole or in parts. they will all be given new bodies! then all believers who are still alive will also rise up to where he is, in a wonderful reunion. the artwork illustrates how things possibly may look on that day when our lord jesus returns for his church and all believers are “caught up” with him as his bride. 
 
these are notecards that provide a subtle witness with each message you send. blank on the inside for you to write a message. the scripture text printed on the back of each card. folded size 5 1/2” x 4 1/4”.

the emerald throne scene in heaven notecardmodel: 5nc
condition: new
 
the emerald throne scene
revelation 4:2-6
revelation 5:11-12
 
the apostle john is taken into the heavenly throne room and what a glorious scene it must have been! all of heaven singing praises to god on his throne. john can merely describe this heavenly vision with earthly terms. when the artist researched to do this illustration, she learned that the word “jasper” was used in those days to describe the brilliant precious diamond. it symbolized absolute purity. the carnelian, a blood red translucent gemstone symbolizes the wrath of god. emerald, here with its peaceful green is a symbol of god’s mercy, arching around the throne like a rainbow reminding us of god’s promises to us.

king of kings and lord of lords
revelation 19:11-16
 
the book of revelation, the apostle john’s vivid record of divinely revealed visions and messages, concerns the events surrounding the second coming of christ. this illustration is taken from the scripture that actually describes that dramatic event in detail. the messiah in all his triumphant majesty returns with the armies of heaven, made up of all the faithful of all the ages, to destroy the satanic forces that gather to war against them. this is a picture of christ that is quite different than has been depicted by other artists. although the four gospels do not give a physical description of jesus as he walked on this earth, artists have tried to capture his humanity; his personality. but this artwork captures his deity; his glorious majesty and power. chapter 1 and chapter 19 of revelation give the only actual description of jesus christ. both scriptures were used to create this illustration.
