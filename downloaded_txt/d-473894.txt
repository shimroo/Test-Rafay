boil the cabbage down - traditional song lyrics






image viawikipedia
this old folk song is a favorite among mountain musicians here in the southern appalachians. there are many variations to the words as well as the tune which is very popular for square dances, frolics and back porch pickin' sessions. this old version is from singing of the queen and prince families of western north carolina. a tune from the cd mary jane queen songs i like.


boil the cabbage down, stir'em round and round
come on girls, now dont be slow
but, boil them cabbage down.

raccoon on the rail fence, waitin for the sun
long eared hounds coming down the road
old racoon better run.

boil them cabbage down, stir'em up and down
hurry up liza, now dont be slow
said, boil them cabbage down.

she cut across the broom sage field, i come down the lane
run my finger through the crack of the fence
up jumped liza jane.

boil the cabbage down, stir'em round and round
get up gals, and dont be slow
said, bile them cabbage down.
