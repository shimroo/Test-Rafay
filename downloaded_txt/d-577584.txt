directions to the club (from tallahassee): we are located off rt. 20 (blountstown hwy) to the west of tallahassee. from capital circle take rt. 20 heading west for about 3+ miles. for the main entrance and practice range, watch for the large tac sign. the entrance is just after that sign on the right.for tournaments and classes take laura geddie trail (on the right if you are heading west).go through the open gate and follow that dirt road to the right. if you see the big tac sign you have gone just a bit too far on rt. 20. if you see geddie rd. you have also gone too far. directions from i-10: if you're coming on i-10 take exit 192.  once you are off the interstate head east on hwy 90.(back towards tallahassee).  you will pass a waffle house on the right and a truck stop on the left.  continue on hwy 90.  you will eventually pass over the river on hwy 90 and come to a traffic light.  turn right at the light onto geddie road.  stay on geddie road until it dead ends into hwy 20 (blountstown hwy). turn left just before the large tac sign for the main entrance. for tournaments and classes turn left at laura geddie trail. go through the open gate and follow that dirt road to the right.
