donna berggren, kenner, la
it was a pleasure to do business with you. i would recommend your company to others. your directions were simple and clear and easy to follow. i especially liked receiving an e-mail updating me on the status of my visa application.










margaret doolin, nicholson, pa 
thank you for making the process of getting a china visa so easy. your phone and email response was prompt and courteous. i received my passport with the visa one day earlier than i had anticipated. thank you also for providing a 6-month visa, especially with all of the sars trouble, this will make for a no hassle trip should my original schedule change.
