your health matters
performing diagnostic or therapeutic interventional radiology can give regular, and relatively high, exposure to radiation from scattered x-rays. we specifically design protective devices to significantly reduce this exposure to the head, eyes, thyroid, and body. the risk of injuries induced by occupational exposure is well documented and numerous studies have been undertaken covering the benefits of using suitable protective shields.
