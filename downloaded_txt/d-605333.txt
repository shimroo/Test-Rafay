global ecology
the association endeavors to promote the advancement of hydrogen energy in propelling the
                                global transition from unabated fossil fuels to clean sustainable energy, presenting
                                climate and system benefits as well as system flexibility. as a complement to other
                                clean energy technologies, including solar and wind energy, hydrogen energy technologies
                                have the ability to decarbonize industries including steel, petrochemicals, fertilizers,
                                heavy-duty mobility (on and off-road), maritime shipping, and aviation, as well as to
                                support flexible power generation (among other applications). by 2050, hydrogen may
                                contribute more than 20 percent of annual global emissions reductions.
