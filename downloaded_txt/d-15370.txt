fixing salinity levels in florida bay


everglades restoration restores more natural flows into and through the everglades. the seagrass meadows of florida bay make up the largest continuous seagrass bed on earth. along with the mangrove forests lining the coast, these seagrass meadows are the reason florida bay can support such a great diversity and quantity of life. every time florida bay experiences an extreme hypersalinity event, seagrass dies. most of the issues in florida bay are tied to out-of-balance salinity.
everglades restoration is working to prevent high salinity and protect seagrass by restoring freshwater flow into the everglades.
