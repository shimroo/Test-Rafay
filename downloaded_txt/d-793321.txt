partial funding for mound water treatment plant approved and continued work on securing final fundingmarch 12, 2024: the city of mound receives federal fundingmarch 7, 2024: league of minnesota cities' day on the hill event & meeting with state representatives updated: february 14, 2024:  in 2023, the city of mound received $10.3m (state funding) of the total $36m estimated project cost for a new water treatment plant. this first tranche of funding will allow us to get moving on the full project design and some of the early-phase work and set the stage for future requests as we work to finish the project over the next multiple years.more work is being done at the local and state level as it relates to securing more funding to get the project across the finish line – but this first round of funding was a big step and a demonstration of commitment to clean water by the state legislature. please remember to thank our mn senator and representative for their hard work on our behalf. we are grateful for their continued advocacy and support!senator kelly morrison - email: sen.kelly.morrison@senate.mn  phone: 651-296-9261representative andrew myers - email: rep.andrew.myers@house.mn.gov  phone: 612-615-8444previous updatesthe previous updates and links below provide insightful information to help you manage safe, affordable, and healthful drinking water within your household as we will continue to live with the manganese issues within our community through completion of the project.  this “water news” tab will continue to be our clearing house for information as the project evolves and progresses.march 3, 2023 (previous) update: the city council and staff continue to actively work to resolve the elevated manganese issues identified in our water supply. the city engineers at bolton and menk have re-run the numbers for the proposed water treatment plant and due to inflation, supply chains, and market trends; the total cost is now at $36.4 million – making this project even more challenging for the city to fund.  we are actively working with senator kelly morrison and representative andrew myers to continue pursuing state funding for this crucial project.  both morrison and myers are supportive of mound’s need for a water treatment plant to remove the manganese from the water. more information regarding manganese in water can be found at these minnesota department of health web pages:manganese in drinking water (state.mn.us) home water treatment (state.mn.us)if you are interested in hiring a laboratory to test your water, a list of accredited laboratories can be found here. this testing would be at the requester's expense.
