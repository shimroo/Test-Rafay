what we offer 



our stock 































				alloy 200/201 pipe & fittings			


nickel 200 (uns  no2200) is commercially pure (99.6%) wrought nickel. it has excellent mechanical properties and is highly resistant in myriad corrosive environments. both nickel 200 and 201 are approved for construction of pressure vessels and components under asme boiler and pressure vessel code section viii, division 1. nickel 200 can be used to reduce the development of passive oxide films in highly oxidative media.

				alloy 020 pipe & fittings			


incoloy® alloy 020 (uns n08020) is an austenitic nickel-iron-chromium alloy with additions of copper and molybdenum. the nickel content makes alloy 20 resistant to chloride-ion stress-corrosion cracking. copper and molybdenum give resistance to reducing environments.


			read more »		






				alloy c-276 pipe & fittings			


hastelloy® alloy c-276 (uns n10276) is known for its outstanding corrosion resistance in a wide range of severe media. the high nickel and molybdenum contents provide good corrosion resistance in reducing environments while chromium imparts resistance to oxidizing media.


			read more »		






				duplex 2205 pipe & fittings			


duplex 2205 stainless steel (uns s31803) is resistant to chlorides and h2s. is a problem solver in most industry segments. duplex 2205 is utilized in heat exchangers and piping in oil and gas, oil refinery, chemical, and petrochemical industry.


			read more »		






				alloy 803 pipe & fittings			


incoloy® alloy 803 (uns s35045) is an iron-nickel-chromium alloy. the nickel and chromium contents are higher than those of alloy 800h and 800ht. a cost-effective material that provides an exceptional level of high-temperature corrosion resistance in oxidation, sulfidation, and carburization environments.


			read more »		






				alloy 601 pipe & fittings			


inconel® 601 (uns n06601) nickel-chromium-iron alloy is a general-purpose engineering material for applications that require resistance to heat and corrosion. the outstanding characteristic of inconel® alloy 601 is its resistance to high-temperature oxidation. the alloy also has good resistance to aqueous corrosion, has high mechanical strength, and is readily formed, machined, and welded.

				alloy 304/304h pipe & fittings			


alloy 304h (uns s30409) type 304/304h  is a modification of type 304 with carbon content controlled in the range of 0.04 to 0.10 for increased strength at temperatures above approximately 800 degrees f. unlike 304l, type 304/304h with a higher carbon content makes the steel more suitable for use in higher-temperature applications.


			read more »		






				titanium grade 2 and 7 pipe & fittings			


titanium grade 2 (r50400) and grade 7 (uns r52400) pipe in the realm of industrial and engineering applications, the selection of materials plays a pivotal role in determining the longevity, efficiency, and overall performance of various components. when it comes to demanding environments that require exceptional corrosion resistance, high strength-to-weight ratios, and biocompatibility, titanium emerges as a standout choice.
