			1st
combat 
      signal regiment (1csr)

1csr was renamed 
 1st 
      combat signal regiment from 1st command support 
			regiment in january 2006. 





 





support squadron renamed 
	  headquarters squadron





on the 18 may 2011, support 
	  squadron was renamed headquarters squadron.  the new name provides 
	  the direct link to the life support/combat support that the unit provides 
	  not only to the regiment but also the intrinsic link to headquarters 1st 
	  brigade and that same support we provide to them.  the second 
	  objective enables the squadron the opportunity to return to the historic 
	  link with headquarters company, 1st australian task force, in vietnam in 
	  1966.

			  this was formed to provide administrative and logistical support 
			  staff to hq 1 atf (the forerunners of hq 1 bde), which included 
			  personnel ranging from intelligence to pay clerks. during its 
			  deployment it suffered eleven kia as follows:

			  hq coy, 1 atf, also had a platoon of infantry soldiers in defence 
			  and employment platoon 
			  (d&e pl), who in the early days of the task force were employed in 
			  building the facilities required by hq 1 atf. the d&e pl further 
			  had the additional responsibility of defending hq 1 atf by 
			  providing the last line of defence.
d&e pl, 1 atf, 
			  was the longest continuously serving infantry platoon in south 
			  vietnam, being continuously reinforced through the 1st australian 
			  reinforcement unit. the platoon remained on the order of battle 
			  until late 1971 when 1 atf withdrew from nui dat to vung tau. 
			  another point of interest is that general peter john cosgrove ac mc, 
			  was the pl comd of d&e pl from 30 sep 1969 â 30 jul 1970.

signaller alexander young battlefield communication wing 













on the 8th august 2018, the 1st 
	combat signal regiment formally opened the
	signaller alexander young 
	 battlefield  communication wing, the first of its kind to be embedded 
	into a combat signal regiment of the royal australian corps of signals.  






the establishment of the wing enables all units 
  within the 1st brigade the opportunity to hone their skills in 
  digital literacy â skills which have become paramount for militaries in the 21st 
  century.





central to the ceremony was an unveiling of a 
  plaque by col darren moore, csm and mrs lynette mchale commemorating the 
  involvement of 104 sig sqn in the battle of coral balmoral, south vietnam with a 
  dedication to 104 sig sqn lineman, signalman young, who was kia during the 
  battle.  lynette is the younger sister of the fallen signalman.
