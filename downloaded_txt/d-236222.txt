i am still a happy hammock user, and my baby is 20 months old at this writing. in fact, i am expecting another baby, and may have to purchase another hammock if i can’t get the current user into a bed in a few months!


taylor winston-mcgrath












 

we have used the hammock when the situation has arised for our less acutely ill babies. for these infants it has been very comfortable and the parents have been very impressed with it.

just a brief note to tell you how happy we are with the hammock we recently purchased from you for our babies room. the staff are so impressed with the soothing effect the rocking has on a distressed and fussy baby. .

i am writing to express our gratitude to you and your company for the hammocks you have so generously donated for our nursery. the new model “nature’s nest” is a safe, comfortable and very attractive addition to our sleep room.


robin coffey

the maternity unit of this hospital has a quantity of hammocks, which are proving to be most successful. we would highly recommend the amby baby hammock.
