liberty bible church

  







 

who we are"for this is the will of god, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men-- as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of god." 1 peter 2:15-16liberty bible church is a congregation of believers in jesus christ, united by mutual agreement for promoting church life according to the new testament pattern:conducting public services of worship and encouragementteaching the word of godobserving the ordinances as commanded in scripturegiving opportunity for christian servicepromoting evangelistic and missionary endeavors both at home and abroad 

 




 

we believe the bible to be the verbally and plenarily inspired word of god.

 

we believe in one triune god, father, son, and holy spirit. we believe that jesus christ is god and that he came as the son of god in order to reveal god to sinful man.

 

we believe in virgin birth of jesus, his perfect life, and death on the cross for all as a substitutionary sacrifice for sins, and subsequent resurrection.

 

we believe that man was created in the image of god and that all have sinned. we believe that salvation is a free gift from god because of his grace, and is accessed by anyone exercising personal faith in the lord jesus christ.

 

we believe that all true believers, once saved, are kept saved by god's power and are secure in christ forever. we believe that every believer is indwelt and gifted by the holy spirit for ministry and service.

 

we believe that the gift of tongues is not for today.

 

we believe that the church is the body of christ and that the local church should be autonomous, free from any external authority or control.

 

we believe in the personal, imminent, pretribulational, and premillennial coming of our lord jesus christ.




    full doctrinal statement
  









 

historyliberty bible church was formed in the fall of 1980 by a group of believers who wanted to see an independent, fundamental church planted in eureka. with a few committed families and the help of a pastor at a nearby bible church, services were soon begun in a storefront in downtown eureka. gary hedrick pastored the fledgling group for the first eight years, giving the church a solid doctrinal foundation and a commitment to the word of god. through his ministry and the hard work of the new church family, they established an awana program that set the tone for a youth ministry that continues to flourish today.as the church grew, two other storefronts were occupied in lakeview shopping center that accommodated the growth. on august 1, 1988 tom zobrist was called to continue the ministry the lord had blessed.in 1990, liberty's first permanent facility was built on land that the church had miraculously acquired five years before. a multipurpose facility now housed liberty's growing awana, youth, missions, and family worship programs. along with this new building, more growth came, and the addition of sunday school rooms followed in 1994. recent years have seen the addition of a picnic and playground area, along with a youth center in 2010, to help with the day camp ministry that resulted from a partnership with camp of champions usa in 2004.god continues to bless at liberty bible church. numerically and spiritually, we continue to grow and reach out to a lost world. programs for the young and old alike reach our community with the message of salvation through jesus christ. the support of missionaries and the launch of this web site take our ministry around the world. most of all, our central focus is the preaching of the word of god. this spiritual food strengthens us and enables us to continue the work of the ministry.god has truly blessed and we are thankful to him for his manifold blessings.
