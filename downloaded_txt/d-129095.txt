our policies....terms & conditions
all online and all phone orders all are 
		subject to our terms and conditions.when you submit an order to us, you are acknowledging our dann 
		online terms and conditions.
 
shipping costs---our computers are 
		connected to ups's computers. they dictate the freight charges based 
		upon your location and method you have chosen. we do not set the 
		shipping charges, nor do we add any surcharges. higher gas prices have 
		led to higher freight charges. we charge what they charge us. please 
		note...the first pound is always the most expensive....so additional 
		items are added for very little. we are a usa based company and 90% of 
		our shipments are us or canada. we do ship to other countries but we 
		accommodate these shipments. usually we must ship first within the usa 
		and then onto you as most warehouses will not handle these shipments. 
		the shipping costs are as shown in your shopping cart. if we can rebate 
		a small amount---if the shipment turns out to be a bit less--we will do 
		so. we recommend you look into using a freight forwarder based in the 
		usa. we ship ground ups to them....and they handle the shipment the rest 
		of the way to you wherever you are located.
 
we appreciate your business and look forward to sending you some 
		things. 
 
please note...we have a 30 day return policy for receipt of 
		the merchandise for items purchased from 
		dann online that
        have not been altered, monogrammed, damaged, scratched, laundered or worn, 
		with original packaging (manufacturer attached) or that are
        custom/special orders for merchandise. we credit to your original credit card or 
		issue a dann-online
        credit. 
 
custom, special or personalized orders--once in work--are non-cancellable, 
		non-returnable and non-exchangeable. they are obtained or produced just 
		for you. 
"final sale" items are 
		non-returnable, as noted, as they are discontinued items. 
 
 
returns must be authorized and mailing instructions 
		and return authorization codes will be provided. 
all phone orders are all subject to 
		our online terms and conditions.
 shoes, belts and other leather goods cannot have creases, scrapes or scratches or
        other evidence of try-on. underwear, socks, brushes and combs are non-returnable--due 
		to their personal nature & health reasons. (additionally---socks are 
		also a special order in boxes of six.) tailored clothing must be returned in the 
		shipping box with the wooden hanger, if provided. glassware or coasters 
		(that are not personalized) that are returned must arrive back unbroken 
		or un-cracked to received credit. fragile items are packed for shipping 
		to you a certain way. we do not reimburse for 
		freight at either end. we only take back merchandise that was purchased 
		from dann-online....not from another retailer. defective products must 
		be returned within 30 days...before alteration, laundering or wear. 
		while we sell the highest of quality, we cannot guarantee lifespan of 
		any product. any change, repair, or alteration to any dann product where 
		the customer is seeking some adjustment, must be approved prior to the 
		work being done. in the case of a defect or replacement ...we will want 
		the quality control team to see the item...or possibly photos of it 
		(depending upon the item)...so we can 
		learn from any problem. we cannot make replacements without this. shrinkage due to laundering cannot be guaranteed. please 
		follow the manufacturers suggested washing/cleaning instructions. how a 
		product is washed or worn or how frequently worn is not something we 
		have control over. we consider ourselves "purists" therefore almost 
		everything we sell has a high cotton or wool (natural fiber) content and 
		some shrinkage is to be expected. please allow 24-48 business hours to 
		provide return instructions and a code for the box. please allow a few 
		business days to 
		process a return once returned.
in the case of a returned item that is 
		damaged in any way....the final decision to repair or replace is up to 
		the manufacturer.
 
 if a set up fee is required for a custom 
		logo or project--this is a non-returnable fee---once the order has been 
		placed for the artwork to be 
		created.
 
re: copper mailboxes........your new 
		mailbox is covered with pure un-lacquered copper, meaning that, when 
		placed outdoors the copper will darken in color over time. the speed and 
		degree of color change will vary with location and atmospheric quality. 
		to keep your mailbox a bright copper color, consult your local paint or 
		hardware store for information on a clear coat urethane.
copper is going to tarnish if not polished or if 
		a coating is not applied.
 
based upon this...you can see.....
we ship
		
only
fresh, first
        quality current merchandise.   

		it is presumed that it will be returned 
		in the same condition it was shipped to you or it will be returned to 
		you at your expense. 
as a customer---you can count 
		on your shipments from us will be top-notch & 
		very fresh merchandise.
 
we work hard to have the computer monitor show the proper color 
		of things but cannot be absolutely certain of what 
		your computer monitor 
		shows. "exact matches" are never guaranteed....even from same 
		manufacturer as "dye lots" vary from one batch to next. 
in regards to personalized engraved 
		orders----
engraving has been blackened to enhance 
		photography in some cases. the actual engraving will not be black in color. 
		engraving is a process of indenting the metal.
please note ! when you place an expedited shipping order--we 
		move very quickly. rarely--if ever--- can these orders be stopped or cancelled. 
		custom or personalized orders...once placed...are non-cancellable always. 
		and in general....with all orders.....we do not ever guarantee that an 
		order can be stopped once it has been placed. (shipping promptly is 
		considered "good customer service" ---which we aspire to.)
regarding 
		signature required deliveries............certain items---custom 
		or high value--- are always sent with a signature required. if you 
		request no signature should be needed.....you then are taking 
		responsibility for this shipment and its delivery. you release dann 
		online and its shipping warehouse from liability.
when you submit an order to us, you are acknowledging our dann 
		online terms and conditions.
 
please note...during busy holiday 
		times...
shipments can take extra time to be shipped due to heavy 
		warehouse traffic often compounded by seasonal bad weather. personalized 
		orders need additional days for monogramming. 
		ups and fedex do not 
		guarantee anything other than next day service. even then...weather 
		delays are out of everyone's hands. while you personally may not have 
		weather problems in your hometown...if there is challenging weather in 
		one of the shipping hubs around the country...your package could 
		experience delays. ordering early is always such a good idea ! almost
		all orders during busy 
		holiday shipping time at some point are "expedited"....so orders are 
		handled and processed as quickly as possible--in the order received. they will ship when they 
		are processed and ready to go. we cannot guarantee any shipping delivery 
		during this holiday time other than confirmed next day air 
		shipping---with orders received early in the am eastern time & the 
		warehouse able to accomodate the ship that day service. next day air 
		orders placed on friday am (that are able to ship on friday) will arrive on 
		monday as this is considered the next regular shipping/delivery day. 
		saturday delivery is available but for an additional fee on top of 
		shipping fees you see online. will be quoted. 
		
most expedited shipments---and/or shipments 
		to businesses--- are sent "signature required". someone must be 
		available to sign for these packages as they are not simply left. ups or 
		fed ex will leave a notice and attempt to redeliver the next business 
		day. (shipment around federal/religious holidays usually need an 
		additional day.) timelines of the shipments cannot be guaranteed in 
		these situations. we ship to the address you give to us.
 
please 
		plan ahead as best you can and we will do all we can to get your 
		merchandise to you ! 
 
returns
we do not reimburse for freight at either 
		end.
returns must be authorized and mailing instructions 
		and return authorization codes will be provided.
		we provide a special code for the box---to insure proper credit 
		to your account--- and the proper address to return it to.....often 
		different than the origination address.
unauthorized returns subject to a restocking fee or 
		may be returned to you. 
		most unauthorized shipments--without a proper return code are refused at the warehouse.
		tracking numbers are strongly recommended for your security with  
		your returned 
		merchandise. if we have not provided a return authorization number and 
		the correct shipping address for a return---we are not responsible in 
		any way for a wayward shipment of an unauthorized return. when we ship packages out...we reserve the right to choose the most efficient shipping method, 
		particularly with international shipping, weather conditions, holiday 
		rush, final destination location. usps is often used if ups has 
		gone for the day. usps also still delivers to you on a saturday (as of 
		this writing)...also another 
		reason for our occasional shipping choice. usps requires special 
		handling on our part and no financial reimbursement will occur. 
international shipments can have 
		delays caused by your customs dept of your country....also something we 
		cannot control. we will attempt to keep you informed as we receive 
		information. international shipments 
timelines cannot be 
		guaranteed....they simply take additional time to reach the final 
		destination. in the case of returned gifts.......the recipient may need 
		to provide a credit card to pay for the new frieght of a new size or 
		color. 
shipments are not sent out "on consignment" 
		.............to be looked at and then returned freight free. we ship 
		what is ordered...in your size and color selection. if you choose to 
		return...it is at your expense.
 
address accuracy

		 refused shipments, incorrect/partial shipping addresses 
		given or failure to obtain merchandise from ups or other carriers after repeated attempts 
		may result in additional freight charges. we ship to the exact address 
		and postal code you give to us. delayed or lost packages due to 
		incorrect/partial information given is the responsibility of the consumer. 
		ups/fed ex likes/needs a suite # or firm name for deliveries in large 
		buildings/housing complexes---along with a street address. partial info 
		given can results in lost or delayed shipments. shipping companies now 
		charge back additional funds, for instance, if an apartment or suite 
		number is needed...but not given. this cost will be passed along to you 
		as we would have no way of knowing that you are giving us a partial 
		address. if a delay or confusion 
		occurs, we will ask you to call the local ups/fed ex office to you to 
		get involved in resolving the shipping problem. you know your locale 
		better than anyone and can be most helpful to redirect the package. 
		please take a moment to double check the info you have given to us. if 
		the address is not entered correctly, your package may be returned as 
		undeliverable. you would then have to place a new order. save time and 
		avoid frustration by entering the address information in the appropriate 
		boxes and double-checking for typos and other errors. 

re: paypal orders. 
		your account with paypal may show one address............but if you then 
		submit a dann order and put a different (or incorrect address) please 
		note that we use the address given to us on the dann order. this is 
		exactly what we go by. make sure you have entered the correct address !

		wayward or non-received shipments need to be reported 
		within 30 days. we 
		will start a trace for it but timely searches always 
		yield the best results. shipment claims of non-receipt months later are 
		generally problematic. if you ship someone a gift....always a good idea 
		to check with them in a timely manner to make sure they have received it 
		!
we do not reimburse for freight at 
		either end for returns.
 
returned merchandise 
		takes several 
		business days to be 
		checked back in once it arrives back at the warehouse. it must be 
		checked back in and inspected before we can credit you.we cannot control 
		the workload of the warehouse---which varies from season to season. we 
		will credit you as soon as we have notification of merchandise being 
		checked back in & inspected---and it then batches into our bookkeeping system at midnight est.
		your bank will then take a few
		business days to post this 
		credit---based upon their schedule to do so...which we do not control. 
		we always strive for a fast checkin and credit process....but please 
		allow about 10 business days before you then see a 
		credit posted on your bank account.
 
lost shipments......if a trace is neccessary of 
		ups or fed ex claim of non-receipt of the consumers goods trace of the 
		package must be started....please note that this takes some time. please 
		allow several business days for the warehouse to process the claim 
		request and fill out the necessary forms. it is then in ups or fed ex 
		hands to retrace the package and get back to us with their 
		findings--based upon their schedule to do so...which we do not control. 
		an insurance claim for a shipper refund takes 
		additional time. if ups or fed ex shows proof of delivery of a 
		product----and you claim otherwise-----we wait until ups or fed ex gives 
		us final resolution before we issue credit or ship new merchandise. the 
		shipping companies are not quick to issue credit for shipments they have 
		proof of delivery for.......so a verification process must ensue.
 
please contact us via email with your questions and we will be sure to get back to
        you promptly. we do not have a printed catalog.....our website is updated continually so
        check back often for new products and updates !  please join our

		shows. "exact matches" are never guaranteed....even from same 
		manufacturer as "dye lots" vary from one batch to next. 
in regards to personalized engraved 
		orders----
engraving has been blackened to enhance 
		photography in some cases. the actual engraving will not be black in color. 
		engraving is a process of indenting the metal.
please note ! when you place an expedited shipping order--we 
		move very quickly. rarely--if ever--- can these orders be stopped or cancelled. 
		custom or personalized orders...once placed...are non-cancellable always. 
		and in general....with all orders.....we do not ever guarantee that an 
		order can be stopped once it has been placed. (shipping promptly is 
		considered "good customer service" ---which we aspire to.)
 
when you submit an order to us, you are acknowledging our dann 
		online terms and conditions.
 
please note...during busy holiday 
		times...
shipments can take extra time to be shipped due to heavy 
		warehouse traffic often compounded by seasonal bad weather. personalized 
		orders need additional days for monogramming. 
		ups and fedex do not 
		guarantee anything other than next day service. even then...weather 
		delays are out of everyone's hands. while you personally may not have 
		weather problems in your hometown...if there is challenging weather in 
		one of the shipping hubs around the country...your package could 
		experience delays. ordering early is always such a good idea ! almost
		all
orders during this busy 
		holiday shipping time at some point are "expedited"....so orders are 
		handled and processed as quickly as possible--in the order received. they will ship when they 
		are processed and ready to go. we cannot guarantee any shipping delivery 
		during this holiday time other than confirmed next day air 
		shipping---with orders received early in the am eastern time & the 
		warehouse able to accomodate the ship that day service. next day air 
		orders placed on friday am (that are able to ship on friday) will arrive on 
		monday as this is considered the next regular shipping/delivery day. 
		saturday delivery is available but for an additional fee on top of 
		shipping fees you see online. will be quoted. 
most expedited shipments---and/or shipments 
		to businesses--- are sent "signature required". someone must be 
		available to sign for these packages as they are not simply left. ups or 
		fed ex will leave a notice and attempt to redeliver the next business 
		day. (shipment around federal/religious holidays usually need an 
		additional day.) timelines of the shipments cannot be guaranteed in 
		these situations. we ship to the address you give to us.
 
please 
		plan ahead as best you can and we will do all we can to get your 
		merchandise to you ! 
 
returns
returns must be authorized and mailing instructions 
		and return authorization codes will be provided.

we provide a special code for the box---to insure proper credit 
		to your account--- and the proper address to return it to.....often 
		different than the origination address.
unauthorized returns subject to a restocking fee or 
		may be returned to you. 
		most unauthorized shipments--without a proper return code are refused at the warehouse.
		tracking numbers are strongly recommended for security with returned 
		merchandise. if we have not provided a return authorization number and 
		the correct shipping address for a return---we are not responsible in 
		any way for a wayward shipment of an unauthorized return. when we ship packages out...we reserve the right to choose the most efficient shipping method, 
		particularly with international shipping, weather conditions, holiday 
		rush, final destination location. usps is often used if ups has 
		gone for the day. usps also still delivers to you on a saturday (as of 
		this writing)...also another 
		reason for our occasional shipping choice. usps requires special 
		handling on our part and no financial reimbursement will occur. 
international shipments can have 
		delays caused by your customs dept of your country....also something we 
		cannot control. we will attempt to keep you informed as we receive 
		information. international shipments 
timelines cannot be 
		guaranteed....they simply take additional time to reach the final 
		destination.
 
address accuracy

		 refused shipments, incorrect/partial shipping addresses 
		given or failure to obtain merchandise from ups or other carriers after repeated attempts 
		may result in additional freight charges. we ship to the exact address 
		and postal code you give to us. delayed or lost packages due to 
		incorrect/partial information given is the responsibility of the consumer. 
		ups/fed ex likes/needs a suite # or firm name for deliveries in large 
		buildings/housing complexes---along with a street address. partial info 
		given can results in lost or delayed shipments. shipping companies now 
		charge back additional funds, for instance, if an apartment or suite 
		number is needed...but not given. this cost will be passed along to you 
		as we would have no way of knowing that you are giving us a partial 
		address. if a delay or confusion 
		occurs, we will ask you to call the local ups/fed ex office to you to 
		get involved in resolving the shipping problem. you know your locale 
		better than anyone and can be most helpful to redirect the package. 
		please take a moment to double check the info you have given to us. if 
		the address is not entered correctly, your package may be returned as 
		undeliverable. you would then have to place a new order. save time and 
		avoid frustration by entering the address information in the appropriate 
		boxes and double-checking for typos and other errors. 

re: paypal orders. 
		your account with paypal may show one address............but if you then 
		submit a dann order and put a different (or incorrect address) please 
		note that we use the address given to us on the dann order. this is 
		exactly what we go by. make sure you have entered the correct address !

		wayward or non-received shipments need to be reported 
		within 30 days. we 
		will start a trace for it but timely searches always 
		yield the best results. shipment claims of non-receipt months later are 
		generally problematic. if you ship someone a gift....always a good idea 
		to check with them in a timely manner to make sure they have received it 
		!
we do not reimburse for freight at 
		either end for returns.
 
returned merchandise 
		takes several 
		business days to be 
		checked back in once it arrives back at the warehouse. it must be 
		checked back in and inspected before we can credit you.we cannot control 
		the workload of the warehouse---which varies from season to season. we 
		will credit you as soon as we have notification of merchandise being 
		checked back in & inspected---and it then batches into our bookkeeping system at midnight est.
		your bank will then take a few
		business days to post this 
		credit---based upon their schedule to do so...which we do not control. 
		we always strive for a fast checkin and credit process....but please 
		allow about 10 business days before you then see a 
		credit posted on your bank account.
 
lost shipments......if a trace is neccessary of 
		ups or fed ex claim of non-receipt of the consumers goods trace of the 
		package must be started....please note that this takes some time. please 
		allow several business days for the warehouse to process the claim 
		request and fill out the necessary forms. it is then in ups or fed ex 
		hands to retrace the package and get back to us with their 
		findings--based upon their schedule to do so...which we do not control. 
		an insurance claim for a shipper refund takes 
		additional time. if ups or fed ex shows proof of delivery of a 
		product----and you claim otherwise-----we wait until ups or fed ex gives 
		us final resolution before we issue credit or ship new merchandise. the 
		shipping companies are not quick to issue credit for shipments they have 
		proof of delivery for.......so a verification process must ensue.
