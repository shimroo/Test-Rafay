six months to sell?  that’s the average





half a year.  that’s the average amount of time it’s taking to sell a home in portland. nothing should be eye-opening anymore, but this average market time grabbed my attention.  goodness.  so much happens in six months’ time (except home sales, apparently).   technically, the average is 177 days- 15 days longer than a year ago.  let me be clear.  as i’ve said often on this blog, real estate is local.  it’s micro.  certain areas, neighborhoods, and houses will simply sell faster (or slower) based on a variety of factors.   keeping that in mind, here are the average market times for different areas of portland metro, listed from the least days on the market to the most. dom = area 112 = north portland132 = northwest washington county133 = southeast portland155 = gresham, troutdale163 = milwaukie, clackamas, happy valley166 = northeast portland168 = beaverton, aloha191 = hillsboro, forest grove208 = oregon city, canby220 = lake oswego, west linn234 = west portland238 = tigard, tualatin, sherwood, wilsonville data was provided by the rmls.
