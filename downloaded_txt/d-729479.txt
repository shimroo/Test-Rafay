letters to an artist~





january 12, 2007dear izabella,in 1903, the poet rainer maria rilke responded by letter to a young man seeking his advice. rilke eventually wrote ten letters now collectively known and much published as "letters to a young poet." they are heartfelt advice from a successful (but still struggling) artist to another who was deeply mired in self-doubt. the classic language of these letters soars in beauty as well as lofty good sense. his idealism is applicable today to all who might pursue any sort of creative activity. yesterday, on a pathside bench deep in a blustery, storm-destroyed forest, i reread the letters. here, partly in direct quotation and partly in condensed summation, are some of rilke's ideas:your work needs to be independent of others' work.you must not compare yourself to others.no one can help you. you have to help yourself.criticism leads to misunderstandings and defeatism.work from necessity and your compulsion to do it.work on what you know and what you are sure you love.don't observe yourself too closely, just let it happen.don't let yourself be controlled by too much irony.live in and love the activity of your work.be free of thoughts of sin, guilt and misgiving.be touched by the beautiful anxiety of life.be patient with the unresolved in your heart.try to be in love with the questions themselves.love your solitude and try to sing with its pain.be gentle to all of those who stay behind.your inner self is worth your entire concentration.allow your art to make extraordinary demands on you.bear your sadness with greater trust than your joy.do not persecute yourself with how things are going.it's good to be solitary, because solitude is difficult.it's good to love, because love is difficult.you are not a prisoner of anything or anyone.rainer maria rilke (1875-1926) was born in czechoslovakia and died in switzerland. dogged by fragile health and the constant search for inexpensive and healthful accommodation, he anxiously moved from one climate to another. considered the greatest modern poet in the german language, rilke counselled the young poet, known only as mr. kappus, over a five-year period. no evidence exists that they ever met.best regards,  robertps: "being an artist means not numbering or counting, but ripening like a tree, which doesn't force its sap, standing confidently in storms, not afraid that summer may not come." (rainer maria rilke)esoterica: two main themes--trust and patience--pervade rilke's letters. "always trust yourself and your own feelings, as opposed to arguments and discussions," he says. "if it turns out that you are wrong, then the natural growth of your inner life will eventually guide you to other insights. allow your judgments a silent, undisturbed development, which, like all progress, must come from deep within and cannot be forced or hastened. everything is gestation and then birthing. to let each impression and each embryo of a feeling come to completion, entirely in itself, in the dark, in the unsayable, the unconscious, beyond the reach of one's own understanding, and with deep humility and patience to wait for the hour when a new clarity is born: this is what it means to live as an artist."see more writings of the painters keys....   http://www.painterskeys.com

through sunlit day and starry nighta soft breeze lifts a leaf to flightin midst of wildflowers a maiden sleepsher beauty doth make man to weepa handsome knight with golden eyesholds vigil under cloudless skiesto keep the damsel from harms waywhile in sweet repose she layunknown to him he fills her dreamsof walking hand in hand by silver streamsand as day's lamp shines from abovehe sings to her his songs of love~t. beaman

ophelia by arthur rimbaudon the calm black water where the stars are sleepingwhite ophelia floats like a great lily;floats very slowly, lying in her long veils...in the far-off woods you can hear them sound the mort.for more than a thousand years sad opheliahas passed, a white phantom, down the long black river.for more than a thousand years her sweet madnesshas murmured its ballad to the evening breeze.the wind kisses her breasts and unfolds in a wreathher great veils rising and falling with the waters;the shivering willows weep on her shoulder,the rushes lean over her wide, dreaming brow.the ruffled water-lilies are sighing around her;at times she rouses, in a slumbering alder,some nest from which escapes a small rustle of wings;a mysterious anthem falls from the golden stars.o pale ophelia! beautiful as snow!yes child, you died, carried off by a river!it was the winds descending from the great mountains of norwaythat spoke to you in low voices of better freedom.it was a breath of wind, that, twisting your great hair,brought strange rumors to your dreaming mind;it was your heart listening to the song of naturein the groans of the tree and the sighs of the nights;it was the voice of mad seas, the great roar,that shattered your child's heart, too human and too soft;it was a handsome pale knight, a poor madmanwho one april morning sate mute at your knees!heaven! love! freedom! what a dream, oh poor crazed girl!you melted to him as snow does to a fire;your great visions strangled your wordsand fearful infinity terrified your blue eye!and the poet says that by starlightyou come seeking, in the night, the flowers that you pickedand that he has seen on the water, lying in her long veilswhite ophelia floating, like a great lily.~forwarded to me, by my friend pilarhttp://www.pipnotes.typepad.com/

going under~





ophelia~there is a willow grows aslant a brook,that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;there with fantastic garlands did she comeof crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purplesthat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:there, on the pendent boughs her coronet weedsclambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;when down her weedy trophies and herselffell in the weeping brook. her clothes spread wide;and, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;as one incapable of her own distress,or like a creature native and induedunto that element: but long it could not betill that her garments, heavy with their drink,pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious layto muddy death.queen gertrudehamlet prince of denmarkact iv scene vii

minstrel sleep~





that time of year thou mayst in me beholdwhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hangupon those boughs which shake against the cold,bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.in me thou see'st the twilight of such dayas after sunset fadeth in the west;which by and by black night doth take away,death's second self, that seals all up in rest.in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,as the deathbed whereon it must expire,consumed with that which it was nourished by.this thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,to love that well which thou must leave ere long.william shakespearephoto by darren holmes www.darrenholmes.com/

a new year~





happiness depends on more than years.all one's moments gather to a wavepassing in a rolling swell of tears,passions too immense to name or save.yet new year's is a crest on which to sing,now poised between the future and the past.each awaits what course the fates may bring,winds that never touch the things that last.years turn and turn with an hypnotic graceeven as the depths of life lie still.although above one cannot silence face,remember that below the divers will.

i grow so weary, someway, of all thingsthat love and loving have vouchsafed to me,since now all dreamed-of sweets of ecstasyam i possessed of: the caress that clings—the lips that mix with mine with murmuringsno language may interpret, and the free,unfettered brood of kisses, hungrilyfeasting in swarms on honeyed blossomingsof passion's fullest flower—for yet i missthe essence that alone makes love divine—the subtle flavoring no tang of this weak wine of melody may here define:—a something found and lost in the first kissa lover ever poured through lips of mine.james whitcomb rileythe lost thrill
