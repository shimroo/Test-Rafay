laudato si’ and creation spirituality





a call to humanity for the sake of life on earth




















in 2015, pope francis released his encyclical, laudato sí: on care for our common home, calling all people of all nations and creeds to radical and unified environmental, social, and cultural change to protect the possibility of life on earth. shortly afterward, matthew fox responded, linking laudato si’ to the longstanding creation spirituality tradition and adding further questions and challenges addressing the looming dangers of these times. as these dangers grow increasingly dire, matthew fox invites you, personally, to download these two documents at right and gather with friends, civic and spiritual groups, and family to explore their questions and take bold and inspired action, whether in partnership with the order of the sacred earth or with a group of your choice. the time to act to protect our mother is now.
