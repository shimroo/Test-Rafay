no time for blogging anymore





and this is why.the new love of my life, my newborn daughter bridget.  she is keeping her daddy and me very busy... but i have never been happier in my life.  suddenly my world is very small, very demanding, and very, very perfect.someday, i'll have a lot more to write about.  but for now, i'm just mommy.bless all of you.
