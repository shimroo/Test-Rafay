for your convenience we have divided cardiologysite into menu topics. please note that there are two different sets of drop-down menus so as to ensure compatibility with older browsers. select an item from the drop-down list and then cycle through the other items within the same topic by clicking on the "next" arrow button (that will be provided on the right hand corners). clicking on the "prior" left corner arrow will return you to the previous page. you may return to this page by clicking on the cardiologysite logo or navigate to the menu by selecting it from the drop-down list. this site includes instructional movies, 3-d animation, panoramic views, online quiz, interactive video-clips, interactive heart sounds & murmurs and interactive echocardiograms.  














goals
cardiologysite.com was conceived to serve as a remote learning experience for health care providers, students, residents, fellows and people interested in expanding their knowledge in specific areas of cardiology. 











  
                equivalent of classroom lectures
                

                                    it was designed to provide the equivalent of classroom lectures and demonstrations with the use of the latest web-based multimedia technology. to facilitate this process, lessons were designed from the ground up instead of scanning in textbooks or videotaping a slide presentation and then modifying it for use on the internet.
