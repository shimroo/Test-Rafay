"i took these men's lives into myself,
and i felt my consciousness

changed,

that god was scraping off all the crud and dirt from my insides
and preparing me to be used by himself for his work."





"some people treat these men and women like superheroes.
however, they were imperfect sinners like us and did a great many things wrong,
some more than others.
rather than accepting their teachings whole, we should seek to

separate the precious from the worthless

and

examine all things and hold fast that which is good

."





"much of the world today is corrupt.
regrettably, much of christian ministy is problematic as well.
these men and women of god, however,
in some cases laboring in obscurity and all but forgotten,
have much to tell us today."





"i've been on short-term mission trips and have been amazed to see what god is doing in the world today.
i would like to know how to be a better missionary, in case i get to go again.
and what better way to do this than to look at gifted lives from the past."





"paul preached

christ's death for us and

his resurrection,
and that 

we may be reunited to god through faith in jesus.
knowing this, shall we not long for every
person on earth to realize this ultimate truth as well?"





"at various times, different countries have been senders of mssionaries, such as palestine, asia minor, ireland, moravia, england and the us.  however, in our day, very many countries share the privilege of bringing forth missionaries---including south korea, india, south africa and brazil!  sharing the gospel and making disciples has become truly worldwide!"





"some think the work of missions is over and the whole world has heard about jesus.
however, by some reckonings, a staggering 40 percent of the world has still not yet heard!
god, i cry to you --- how will they ever hear the good news?  and what can i do to help?"





"jesus said, 'whoever wills may come.'  god's gift of eternal life is an offer, freely given to any and all who would desire to take it.
it's open and available to everyone who wills."





"even in jesus' day, it was recognized that some people would reject god because of the sin of those claiming to be his followers.  some think this is a good excuse to turn away from god.
however, the bible teaches plainly that every person after jesus who has ever sought to follow god is at best a terrible sinner.
the work of the missionary is for one broken sinner to tell another sinner how god can forgive this terrible sin."





"some are tempted to forget god and not serve him anymore if they have many possessions.
some are tempted to fall from god if they have too little.
god, may i never turn back from serving you with all of my strength---whether i am going through good times or bad, may i ever serve you!"













welcome!




welcome to missionary etexts archive, an electronic repository of historical texts by, about and for missionaries.
we hope you enjoy them!




our emphasis is on missionaries whose
spiritual lives or missionary experiences are of potential
value to us today.
this is motivated by paul's teaching concerning the value
of following the example of worthy lives
(phil. 3:17).

the mission





god wants the whole world to know about him.


the earth shall be full of the knowledge of jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
(isaiah 11:9b)


let the peoples praise thee, o god; let all the peoples praise thee.
(psalm 67:3)


jesus commanded his followers to tell the whole world about him.


and jesus came to them and spoke unto them, saying, all authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.
go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit: 
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you: and lo, i am with you always, even unto the end of the world.
(matthew 28:18-20)


and he said unto them, thus it is written, that the christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day; 
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from jerusalem.
(luke 24:46-47)


but ye shall receive power, when the holy spirit is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in jerusalem, and in all judaea and samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
(acts 1:8)


as a result, believers in jesus taken from all nations and tribes of the world will be in heaven with god.


after these things i saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands; 
and they cry with a great voice, saying, salvation unto our god who sitteth on the throne, and unto the lamb.
(revelation 7:9-10)







the message





for god so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.  for god did not send the son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.  he who believes in him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god.  (john 3:16-18)


therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and through him everyone who believes is freed from all things, from which you could not be freed through the law of moses.  (acts 13:38-39)


if you confess with your mouth jesus as lord, and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. for the scripture says, "whoever believes in him will not be disappointed."  for there is no distinction between jew and greek; for the same lord is lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on him; for "whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved."  (romans 10:9-13)
