1 in 8 south carolinians struggle with hunger.


people can't function when they are hungry, and many of our neighbors are unable to afford basic needs like groceries.






























we provide over 27 million meals across our service area each year.


we rescue, pack, transport, and deliver nutritious food to soup kitchens, shelters, food pantries, and schools in twenty counties in south carolina.































which helps neighbors in 20 counties put food on their tables and have hope for a better tomorrow.


we provide hope and security by meeting basic human needs with dignity and compassion.
