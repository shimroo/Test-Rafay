welcomethe missouri state troopers association, mosta as we call ourselves, is a non-profit organization composed of sworn uniformed members and communications personnel of the missouri state highway patrol.  simply put, our main goal is improvement.  we are always working to improve pay and benefits for our members, address employee concerns, and to team with others to support law enforcement and first responder needs in general.  all ranks of patrol troopers and communications personnel are eligible to be members.  we are not a bargaining unit and we accomplish many things by cooperating as a group.our members are involved in communities and organizations throughout the state.  they are proud to serve the citizens of this state anywhere and anytime.  our main support comes from dues paid by our membership.  we donate funds each year to support law enforcement charitable events and to honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.  we encourage and accept donations, but you will not receive fundraising calls from our association. we operate a small commissary primarily to serve the needs of our members.  we do offer several items for sale to the public and encourage you to see what is available by looking at our online store or following us on facebook.public events
