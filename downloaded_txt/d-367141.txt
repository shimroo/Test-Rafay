                              remember - if you want target faces, the
                              easiest (and cheapest) way to get them is
                              to let oliver know what you want the week
                              or two before a state tournament (that
                              oliver is attending) and he would be happy
                              to pull them and bring them to the
                              tournament.  oliver is attending the
                              state target, state fita field, florida
                              senior games and the ft lauderdale
                              open.  lots of opportunity to get
                              target faces at a great price. 
                              mailing is expensive, however oliver will
                              mail them if you really need the target
                              faces (of course - you pay the postage).


                    
tim austin 1938 -

                                it is with sadness that i have to let
                                you know that tim austin lost his battle
                                with cancer today.  tim died
                                peacefully at 1:30pm in the icu at north
                                florida regional hospital in
                                gainesville.  as you know he had
                                been fighting stage iv cancer for two
                                years and had 66 doses of chemo. 
                                there will be a small graveside
                                gathering next week.  i will not be
                                there.  i am in mirimar with jake
                                pettitt running the national senior
                                games which tim would have wanted.

                  release mailing list.   
 

 


this needs to be
                    passed around and acted upon -   it is
                    specifically against nfaa rules to draw above
                    horizontal... it's also against naa
                    rules.   the practice of drawing a bow up
                    in the air is unsafe, and many archers do it due to
                    heavy poundage or simply out of bad
                    habit.   pushing the bow out with the bow
                    arm... or better yet, pushing it slightly
                    downward... can assist in drawing it
                    back.   one arrow loosed high in the air
                    and killing or damaging property three blocks away
                    can set our sport back for years... much less ruin
                    the day of the individual with the bow and the
                    individual harmed by it!



i have created
                    a new page for archery instruction.  we get a
                    lot of queries about archery coaching.  if you
                    would like to be added, please let me know.

is it legal or illegal?  what happens
                      when a rule is questioned
