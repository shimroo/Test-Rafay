neuroimaging clinical study
the neuroimaging clinical study (also called insight 46) is a clinical study with the specific aims of identifying brain changes that accompany healthy ageing and detecting brain changes that might help predict who is at greater risk of developing dementia and alzheimer’s disease.

myofit 46
the human heart’s potential to regenerate itself is lost after childhood so the state of the heart by the time we’ve reached adolescence is a key determinant of our future cardiovascular wellbeing. we are looking for ways to maintain heart health (also known as myocardial fitness, hence the project title myofit46).
