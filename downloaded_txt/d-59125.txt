types of dating events nyc & long island

in person speed dating long island & nyc, ct- usually held at a restaurant or bar that 
	has a separate area.  sometimes they may also take place at the park.  
	these are very structured gender balanced events based on a specific age 
	group.  we do stick to the ages posted and ask for proof of age.  
	you arrive to the venue about 15-30 minutes prior to start time to check in.  
	(note:  some venues have a minimum purchase requirement).  once 
	things get underway, men and women are paired up into groups of two and 
	situated at a station.  you get a specified number of minutes to talk 
	during the speed date.  at the end of the round you take notes to help 
	you remember some details of your date and then the women stay seated and 
	the guys rotate to the next station.  the process continues until you 
	have met everyone.  at the very end of the speed dating event, you will 
	hand in your scorecard that lets us know who you are interested in.  
	within 24 hours, you will receive an email letting you know who you matched 
	with.  both mutual matches and one way matches will be provided.
 
 online speed dating-  held via zoom from the comfort 
	of your home.  virtual speed dating in nyc is super convenient.  
	arrive at the specified start time and your host will explain the rules while welcoming everyone.
	  the host will then pair you up with someone from 
	the opposite sex and you will talk privately for a specified number of 
	minutes (usually around 5).  at the end of each date, you will take 
	some notes to help you remember.  once the event is over, you will send 
	your host a private message in the chat to let them know who you were 
	interested in.  typically within an hour, you will receive the results, 
	both mutual and one way matches.
 
love is blind virtual speed dating  -  this is the same 
	format as the online speed dating, with one catch.  the cameras stay 
	off when you arrive and while you are on your dates.  you get to know 
	people based on their personality first.  at the very event, we have 
	everyone turn their cameras on so you get to see who you were chatting with. 
	
 
in person speed friending-  takes place in long island and nyc 
	and connecticut.  although this event is not exclusively for 
	singles, plenty of singles are in attendance.  
	unlike speed dating in nyc which is one on one, the speed friending puts you in groups of 4-6 people where you can chat with people to make some new friends.
	  
	we give you some ice breakers to use to keep the conversation going.  these events 
	are not gender balanced, so guys meet other guys in the group, women meet 
	other women in the group etc.  submissions of selections are not done 
	in this format.  it is up to participants to get their own contact 
	information after the rounds or at the end of the event.
 
online speed friending- same concept as the in person speed 
	friending, but these events are nationwide.  we meet via zoom and you 
	are paired up with people in a group.  we rotate the groups after a 
	specified period of time and you meet new people.

 
other non singles events- we host both in person events in the 
	long island, nyc and connecticut area.  these may include survey says 
	events, bingo, themed trivia such as seinfeld, friends and more
