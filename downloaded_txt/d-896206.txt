our church
celebrate the living holy sacrifice of our lord and savior jesus christ in the faith of the oriental orthodox church and sacred traditions of the ancient indian orthodox church in the nations capital. learn the history of the church – from catacombs to synods and cathedrals and from bible verses to dogma and doctrine. experience how steadfastness and unwavering faith since the apostolic times withstood the extreme challenges of the centuries. 
st. thomas indian orthodox church, greater washington exists since 1965 in the nation’s capital. it began serving the spiritual needs of immigrant families of all groups in the traditions of st. thomas the apostle of jesus christ in kerala, south india.  the present twelve thousand square feet church building is a living monument of the love of its flock to establish the ancient oriental orthodox christian church just 18 miles north of the us capitol. 
as a body of christ, we are grateful to everybody who supported us spiritually and financially through these years to attain the structure we are today. we request your continued support and prayers.
