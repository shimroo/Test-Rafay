"we went last year and had life-altering encounters with humpback whales. this is the coolest trip ever! baby whales will check you out to assess your capability as playmate or pool toy (it's hard to say which), while mom keeps an eye on the "kids" from below. you zoom along in a zodiac with male whales chasing each other in demonstrations of fitness. you float motionless in the ocean as whale song vibrates your whole body. the dry encounters are equally amazing. as you sip your cocktail watching the sunset, whales will parade past the boat doing all the whalish things, including baby whales practicing skills they learned from their mom, like how to breach, tail or fin slap, and spy hop ("i see you on that boat, silly humans"). go. seriously, just go."becky brenneraustin, tx - 2016

"here are a few words that come to mind when describing the owners and staff of travel masters – professional, competent, honest, reliable, knowledgeable, creative and most important of all – magic! sure, they provide excellent travel services for good value; but what they really excel at is in creating journeys and adventures that are wondrous, life-changing experiences. their deep knowledge of the travel industry and their many contacts throughout the world means that with their guidance, you can strike out and explore destinations with the confidence and security of a veteran traveler. i’m so grateful to have been a travel masters customer for the past 16 years and after returning from each adventure, i immediately begin looking forward to the next one."gladys sparkmanhouston, tx - 2016

  we just returned from an epic red sea scuba trip booked by denise at travel masters. this was a complicated trip with transfers in cairo, hurghada and a pick up the next evening for a 3 hour van ride south to the liveaboard boat, which was excellent. we cannot thank denise enough for the exceptional booking with personalized handlers at all airport transit locations. the trip went flawless, which for egypt is a tough feat, so hat's off to denise and travel masters for putting together a fantastic liveaboard dive trip and cairo tour with private guide.henry, ken and garyaustin, tx 2021
