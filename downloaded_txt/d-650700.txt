canada is home to 20 sites designated as unesco world heritage sites for their exceptional natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and rich cultural history. some of the most renowned include banff national park and jasper national park, located in the magnificent canadian rockies mountain range, the historic district of old québec with architecture and a lifestyle that mimics old europe, the remote and breathtakingly beautiful gros morne national park on the island province of newfoundland, the fossils in miguasha national park which provide a remarkable fossil record of the devonian period, l'anse aux meadows at the very northern tip of newfoundland where evidence of the earliest known european exploration was found, and the stunning landscapes that makeup canada's rocky mountain parks with snow-capped peaks, glacial lakes, rushing waterfalls, and alpine meadows that represent a protective habitat for a significant number of plant and animal species. canada's unesco sites tell stories of ancient indigenous cultures, early exploration, and settlements and provide a glimpse into our diverse natural heritage spanning lush forests, tall peaks, and scenic coastlines that travelers from across the globe come to experience.
the foods you must try in canada
experiencing canadian cuisine is one of the great joys of visiting this diverse country. when it comes to iconic canadian foods, poutine often tops travelers' must-try lists. this classic french-canadian dish originated in rural quebec, consisting of hot french fries topped with brown gravy and cheese curds. the combination of the salty, squeaky curds melting into the rich gravy over the crispy fries makes for the ultimate comfort food. for the best poutine, head to montreal, where specialty poutineries offer endless topping variations, though you'll find versions across quebec and the rest of canada. canada has a thriving food scene ranging from east to west coast delicacies. maritime provinces like nova scotia, new brunswick, and prince edward island produce exceptional seafood like buttery lobster, plump digby scallops, and fresh local oysters from their atlantic fisheries. maple syrup features prominently across canadian cuisine, loved mixed into morning pancakes and waffles or maple-glazed salmon. canada's diverse immigrant communities have also left their marks through dishes like indian-inspired butter chicken, chinese dim sum, and vietnamese phở noodle soups.no matter what part of canada your travels take you, keep an eye out for local specialties and quintessential dishes like poutine that reveal the flavors of canada one tasty bite at a time. just come hungry and leave room for dessert - we recommend maple sugar pie or sweet, fluffy beavertails pastries!
 
whether you seek breathtaking natural wonders, exciting cities, delectable cuisine, indigenous cultural experiences, or canadian hospitality, our range of fully guided group tours checks all the boxes. travel alongside passionate experts and local guides to top sights while enjoying door-to-door transport, quality hotels, most meals, and plenty of built-in free time. check out the 2024-2025 tour schedule, and let us handle the travel planning while you focus on creating unforgettable memories across this diverse, beautiful country!

i wanted to send you this brief note to tell you what a great job gabriela has done in planning our trips over the last four years.   she is efficient, courteous and promptly responds to requests.  she goes above and beyond and researches various trip options while trying to get us the best deal. she has saved time and money and makes her clients feel valued and appreciated.
 
thanks to her, i have not had to haggle with travel and airline companies about trip details or prices.     
 
your company is very lucky to have her as an employee.   i wish her continued success with your company.
