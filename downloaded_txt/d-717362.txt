tunable diode laser absorption spectoscopy (tdlas) - what is it and how does it work ?
tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (tdlas) is a technique that offers a high level of sensitivity and selectivity in measuring specific species in a gas stream. 







solving sampling challenges with probes
sampling toxic gases like hydrogen sulfide (h2s) or sulfur dioxide (so2) for analysis poses significant challenges, primarily due to the high toxicity of these gases, the presence of high water or sulfur dew points, and the disposal of the hazardous analyzed sample.  



 




 
 
            













product spotlight








 

993x gas analyzer
 with an optical bench capable of continuously measuring up to five components in ultraviolet (uv) wavelengths, two components in infrared (ir) wavelengths, hydrogen (h2) with a thermal conductivity detector (tcd) and oxygen (o2), the 993x can provide one analyzer, where multiple analyzers may have previously been required. 



 



wdg-v flue gas oxygen analyzer - safe operation of the burner management system
the wdg-v provides an additional layer of safety when measuring excess oxygen in the burner management system. it has a close-coupled extractive design for fast response in a wide range of flue gas applications up to 1648°c (3000°f).



 

3050-olv moisture analyzer
the 3050 series of moisture analyzers utilizes ametek’s proven, accurate quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) technology. built-in verification provides operators with increased measurement confidence. 3050 series analyzers provide continuous, reliable moisture measurements from moderate to very low (sub-1.0) parts-per-million levels, and are available in a variety of packaging and measurement ranges.






888 sulfur recovery tail gas analyzer - field proven and highly reliable
as the next generation of our field-proven 880-nsl, the 888 utilizes highly reliable ultraviolet spectroscopy to accurately monitor hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide concentrations in sulfur recovery tail gas. this compact, rugged analyzer mounts directly on the process pipe, eliminating the complexity and safety issues of fiber-optic coupled photometers.
