welcome to the burzynski clinic

innovative and cutting-edge precision personalized cancer therapy
medical expertise based on over 40 years of clinical experience and research





our approach to cancer:
our goal is to provide sophisticated cancer care utilizing a personalized and precision targeted immunotherapy approach.
our personalized cancer therapy utilizes an understanding of each patient’s cancer genetic and immunotherapy make-up to unravel the biology of their cancer and to identify effective treatment strategies using targeted therapies and immunotherapies that are aimed at specific genes or proteins that are found only in cancer cells or their environment.




treating cancer since 1977
established in 1977, the burzynski clinic has grown to be a nationally and internationally recognized cancer center that provides cutting-edge cancer treatments. 
for over 40 years, dr. burzynski’s cancer research and patient care has been inspired by the philosophy of the physician hippocrates: ‘first, do no harm’. therefore, our approach to treatment is ‘personalized’ in an attempt to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects for each cancer patient.
