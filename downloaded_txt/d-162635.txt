                      "the words takes the teachings of jesus outside the confines of the church or religiosity and places them in the hands of ordinary people who want to know what jesus came to do and say." - david sanford
                        

"although these words are there to teach and inspire us, their first significance is to make jesus himself more present in today's world." - henri nouwen

"we need to open our hearts, set aside our prejudices, and listen deeply. discussing god is not the best use of our energy, but if we touch the holy spirit we touch god, not as a concept but as a living reality." - thich nhat hanh
