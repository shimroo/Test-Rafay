we plant seeds and grow together to create a healthy missoula.
learn more about our 22 farms and gardens!























community gardenscommunity gardens give space, water, and tools to grow food for yourself and your family (and probably your friends, too!). great for folks who don’t have space at home, need a fence, or want to make new friends. also great for those new to gardening! they are places to feel connected to your community, just by taking part. “my father passed away suddenly in august. the moment i found out, i headed straight to my garden. i cried. i sat in stillness. my garden provided me a safe space to start the grieving process. it embraced my wounded soul and provided some solace at a time i needed it most. i will never forget it.” - lydia faller, community gardener

farm to schoola hands-on, dig in the dirt and eat carrots educational program in missoula elementary schools and on our neighborhood farms. farm to school runs lessons in and manages 8 school gardens, teaches in every single missoula county public school second grade classroom, and buses about 2,400 students to the peas farm for field trips as they eat their way across the farm. “i think there is some sort of magical force field over the garden, because kids will try anything in there. my favorite, really, is the kale. we'll circle around the bed and talk about the curly kale and the dinosaur kale --dinosaur kale is the coolest thing to an 8-year-old! kale has its own consistency and taste, but i've never had a kid that didn't like it. they think it's the best thing to be able to pop off their own little stem of kale and munch on it.” - frances bonne’t, franklin elementary school, second grade teacher

neighborhood farmswe grow beautiful produce for all in our community: from customers at the missoula food bank to csa farm share members. these urban farms grow food with the community, for the community. “truly fulfilling food on so many levels - nutrition, family connection, community, environment.” - annie florin, river road csa farm share member

youth developmentone of our neighborhood farms is dedicated to youth development. the youth farm. run in partnership with youth homes, we employ youth who live in youth homes group homes at the farm. it is often a first time job. it is a place to learn, a place to grow. "our north star is having fun out there. kids oftentimes have a premeditated notion that it's gonna be the worst thing they've ever endured. and, we as a group, like to think we are quite funny and fun loving and also just really accepting. farming may not be fun at all times, but the spirit we bring to it is one of fun." - shane o’leary, youth farm director

dried flowers



aug 23, 2024




who doesn’t love flowers? there’s nothing i love more than wandering around one of our neighborhood farms or gardens mid-summer and admiring the pops of color and intricate details of the different flower varieties. but those days seem far away when fall and winter roll around. luckily, there’s a way to have gorgeous flowers year-round - and it doesn’t involve shipping them across the world!
