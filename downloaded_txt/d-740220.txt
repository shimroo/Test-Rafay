coral is a multidisciplinary model for the integration of technology with collaborative
                                 teaching and learning (e.g., ashcraft & treadwell, 2008, chamberlin, 2000; treadwell, 1999; treadwell, leach,
                                    kellar, lewis & mittan, 1998 ). over the past decade, technology has moved out of the computer lab, into the classroom
                                 and in the cloud as a basic fundamental tool for fostering student creativity and
                                 project-based collaborative learning.  the coral platform is an effort to rethink
                                 the role of the professor in the 21st century classroom pursuing  ‘project based’
                                 collaborative learning in a way that gives students more ownership in the process
                                 and mirroring the complexities found in modern complex organizations. in brief, this
                                 is an active problem-centered approach to collaborative teaching, research, and learning,
                                 fusing the two related approaches (deal, 2009).
currently, faculty members from the departments of psychology (college of the sciences
                                 and mathematics) and management (college of business and public management) at west
                                 chester university of pennsylvania have implemented the coral platform to focus on
                                 the management and evaluation of high performance teams.  an emphasis is placed on
                                 the facilitation of intra-team collaboration and identification of the managerial
                                 practices that lead to synergy and enhanced team performance.
the coral pedagogy fosters the development of skills in using computer and video-technology
                                 as tools to enhance effective collaboration in college courses. the coral model cultivates four major objectives:

integrates several different teaching and learning styles, thereby providing a more
                                    inclusive learning format.
structured by the professors, but led by the students fostering independent thinking
                                    and active learning,
promoting interdependence by having students share the division of labor by formulating
                                    roles and tasks that compel students to reach consensus.
fosters the distinction between collaborative and cooperative learning as an indispensable preliminary step when designing an operational collaborative learning and workplace environment!

within this framework students are encouraged to seek outside opinions without fear
                                 of being criticized.
