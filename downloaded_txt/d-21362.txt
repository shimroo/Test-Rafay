corporate communications









founded in 1975, corporate communications and its wholly owned subsidiary, corporate design, have worked with more than 500 public and private clients in virtually every industry with emphasis on sec-regulated communications such as quarterly earnings announcements and conference calls, investor presentations, financial news releases, proxy management, annual reports, and annual shareholder meeting planning. with a long history of collaboration with the nashville office on client communication projects, we were already familiar with the great work and reputation of finn partners. we saw an exciting opportunity to leverage our combined communications expertise.  adding professional investor relations services extends finn partners reach and positions the agency as an ideal c-suite communications partner. 
finn partners and corporate communications share a common, entrepreneurial spirit that drives us every day to deliver value to our clients. we are proud to join this amazing and talented team of communications professionals.
