    courses
  



palm beach diving“florida with a different drift”at the very heart of florida's treasure coast is the palm beaches, a stretch of coastline which spans riviera beach, down through west palm beach and on to lake worth. here, the gulf stream swings closer to shore to west palm beach than anywhere else along the state. the result is a remarkable catalyst for an environment of warm, clear blue water (70 to 100 foot visibility is the norm) deposited by the currents steady northward flow, and a host of marine creatures, some seldom found anywhere else in florida. this also gives rise to west palm beach's special forte, drift diving. the drill is quite simple. the kyalami too, our dive boat, lines up on one of the two main reef tracts that run just offshore. divers are then dropped in groups of six to twelve and they are followed by the boat while the current takes them along the reef.
