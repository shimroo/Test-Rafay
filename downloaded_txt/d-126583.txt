“great place to brush up on your texas history! the museum is very clean and everyone is very friendly. the sky was so clear, we could see for 30 miles or so all around from the top of the monument!”
 brian crone


“perfect day trip from houston, spent a little over an hour.  observation deck 400+ feet in the air that highlights the position of both armies.  35 minute informational movie that starts on the hour and a great little display of artifacts and timelines of the history of texas.”
 daniel yeager


“this was our second time going but first time going up to observation deck. had a great time. it is a great piece of history! easy access for wheelchair service.”
 tammy emert


“what a magnificent museum and collection of texas history and artifacts. every time i go, i spend hours looking at the treasures and reading about them. any fan of history, especially texas history should make this a must-visit. the monument and grounds speak for themselves. it's unlike anything else outside of visiting the monuments in dc, but san jacinto is awe-inspiring.”
 paul ladd


“what a great little museum! so much to read about the history of texas, the battle of san jacinto, and the monument it's housed in! the 30-minute movie was really great and definitely worth the watch!”
 rosemary ciletti


“what a wonderful experience. if you love history and texas, you will love the museum.  the staff is friendly and passionate and know their texas history. everything really is bigger in texas.”
 emma lanier


“great place to take the kids and show them some hands on texas history! highly recommended.”
 brian king
