mastery of basic mathematics skills for life!
semple math is the complete, basic skills, mathematics program authored by janice l. semple.










 information 

 do you have students who count on their fingers to add and subtract? do they reverse numbers or have difficulty understanding place value? do your students have trouble grasping concepts or abstract language? if these and other teaching challenges sound familiar, you should try semple math. the teaching activities in our program include carefully designed dialogues that lead students through a task analysis of each skill presented. teaching strategies that expose students to experiential stories, familiar images, mnemonic associations, music, rhythm and rhyme aid memory and make the abstractions of mathematics concrete for the learner. as your students succeed they will become excited about math and you will enjoy greater success!  


 how do i get started 

 semple math not only uses unique mnemonic clues to teach skills, it builds skills in a unique sequence. the sequence helps assure that skills, once learned, will be retained and applied successfully. because of the sequence, all students, regardless of age or grade begin semple math at level one. older students often move more quickly than their younger counterparts but follow the same path.
