since 1984, the performing animal   welfare society (paws) has been at the forefront of efforts to rescue and   provide appropriate, humane sanctuary for animals who have been the victims of   the exotic and performing animal trades. paws investigates reports of abused performing and exotic animals, documents   cruelty and assists in investigations and prosecutions by regulatory agencies to   alleviate the suffering of captive wildlife. 












 

 paws is home to asian and  african elephants

the five elephant habitats at ark 2000 provide the elephants with hundreds of acres of varied natural terrain to roam,   lakes and pools to bathe in, and elephant barns equipped with heated   stalls and a indoor therapy pool.

have you taken the pledge
to help elephants?
paws has launched a new campaign called take the pledge! to bring  attention to the use of elephants for tourism and elephant “encounters”  overseas and in the u.s. the only way to stop this form of exploitation is  through education and by decreasing demand for these attractions. read more about paws' "take the pledge" campaign here.
at paws, we care for bears every day. (one of our bears, ben, is pictured above.) bears get far less notice than exotic animals like elephants and  tigers â although once you learn more about bears, they’re just as fascinating.

take the pledge for bears!
at paws, we care for bears every day. (one of our bears, ben, is pictured above.) bears get far less notice than exotic animals like elephants and  tigers â although once you learn more about bears, they’re just as fascinating.
as part of our take the pledge for bears campaign, paws has been drawing attention to an animal that deserves more of our respect and protection in the wild and in captivity. for example: each month in our newsletters during 2023, we provided  interesting and sometimes little-known facts about bears â their intelligence, agility, and complex behaviors.

captive bears are overlooked animals â and they suffer  more than you know. you can make a difference!
click here to learn  more, sign our petition, and take the pledge for bears!

tiger cub cleo,
settles into sanctuary life
cleo is taking  to sanctuary life beautifully, since her arrival at paws. this tiger  cub has been through so much in her young life, but she is resilient and full  of energy!
when confiscated from a private  facility by the california department of fish and wildlife in late february,  cleo suffered from severe metabolic bone disease (mbd). this very painful  condition, caused by inadequate nutrition, left her with multiple bone fractures  and deformities. she was temporarily housed at the oakland zoo, where she  received excellent care and proper nutrition for seven weeks.
cleo arrived at paws and  immediately endeared herself to paws’ caregiving staff. although mbd has  caused permanent damage to bones in her neck and legs, she is growing stronger  and more active and playful every day.
we love seeing cleo explore her  spacious enclosure, where she stalks and pounces playfully among the tall  grasses or relaxes under a tree while enjoying the sights, scents, and sounds  of nature.
cleo loves water, and she enjoys  splashing and soaking in her pool. she is calm, confident, and friendly,  and our animal care staff is smitten with her.
"we are grateful to the  oakland zoo for providing safe, emergency placement after she was confiscated,  and for giving her a head start on the long road to recuperation and  healing," said paws director of veterinary services dr. jackie gai.
paws provides the perfect  combination of expert, individualized care, and a peaceful, natural setting.  with sound nutrition, dedicated daily care, and veterinary attention, when  necessary, cleo is in excellent hands. welcome home, little cleo!

you can help captive tigers!
by far, the largest  number of animals rescued by paws are tigers â making them one of the animals  most desperately in need of your help. we have rescued tigers from cub petting  operations, circuses, roadside zoos, and private owners.
caring for tigers is  expensive. it costs $20,000 to care for one healthy tiger for a year â about  $400 a week per big cat. that’s why we need your help.
your donation to paws  works in two important ways:
you provide rescued  tigers with large habitats filled with trees, grass, pools, and native  vegetation. our expert staff provides daily care, veterinary attention,  nutritious food, and 24/7 monitoring.
you support paws’ efforts  to end the exploitation of tigers for entertainment. click here to learn more.
