border patrol leaves hundreds of asylum seekers stranded in the cold, detains and threatens aid workers attempting to respond

stickyfebruary 10, 2024 no more deaths 



inches of snow fell along the border wall near sasabe, arizona this weekend
approximately 400 asylum seekers waited along the border wall near sasabe, arizona yesterday, in hopes of being picked up by border patrol. 
border patrol never came. during the night, snow and freezing temperatures set in. by this morning, a few inches of snow had accumulated and humanitarian aid volunteers found hundreds of people still stranded along the wall with no sign of a border patrol response. 
volunteers with no more deaths, tucson samaritans, and green valley samaritans began evacuating people to the border patrol station in sasabe. many volunteers were detained and threatened with arrest by border patrol agents who said that they were informed of the situation but did not plan to drive out to address it. as the snow melted and road conditions turned muddy, volunteer vehicles continued to evacuate people despite threats of arrest in anticipation of more dangerously cold conditions tonight.
now, border patrol is refusing to allow more people into the station to be processed. at the time of writing, there are over 250 adults and children left exposed to the elements outside of the sasabe station. despite persisting for over three months, border patrol has failed to adequately allocate resources to address this ongoing crisis.people cannot be left out in such life-threatening conditions. a response must be enacted now to establish adequate shelters, warming centers, and other basic necessities for those who seek safety and asylum in sasabe.

urgent: emergency humanitarian relief at the border

donate today to help sustain our humanitarian aid efforts at the border

donate now

there is a humanitarian crisis ongoing at the border as we are seeing drastically increased numbers of asylum seekers crossing in remote mountain areas. customs and border protection has not been adequately responding, at times even threatening humanitarian aid volunteers with arrest while leaving hundreds stranded in deadly, hypothermic conditions. no more deaths / no más muertes, fellow humanitarian aid groups, community groups, and individuals have stepped up to help care for them, but the situation is continuing to escalate. the tucson sentinel wrote an article that illuminates the suffering and dire need, please check it out here.
thus far we have re-allocated funds to manage this support, but those funds are running low and our work is far from over. we are asking our community to help us by making a donation today so we can continue to provide blankets, clothing, food, shoes, and other humanitarian aid. our volunteers are working tirelessly to get these supplies directly to the people in danger of hypothermia and exposure due to the winter weather.

donate now

we appreciate our community for continuing to support our humanitarian aid efforts. without you, it would not be possible to make a significant impact on the crisis. please email us at fundraising@nomoredeaths.org with any questions.

border patrol neglects asylum seekers in winter storm, threatens aid workers with arrest

stickydecember 23, 2023 no more deaths 



the road along the border wall near sasabe
sasabe, arizona – last night, humanitarian aid workers scrambled to triage and support 300 asylum seekers stranded along the border wall east of sasabe, arizona. a winter storm blew in, dumping rain upon the hundreds of men, women, children, and babies left without adequate shelter in the remote location. recognizing the urgency of the situation, volunteers notified border patrol that they would be driving asylum seekers to the sasabe substation to be processed, to get them out of the life-threatening cold.volunteers were told that this was illegal. meanwhile, border patrol agents refused to send personnel to the area, citing road conditions and limited space in vehicles as the reason for their lack of response. they advised volunteers to call 911 if there was a medical emergency. the message from border patrol was loud and clear: you’re on your own.despite the constraints of providing humanitarian aid in a place where cell phone service is limited and the nearest ambulance is two hours away, humanitarian aid volunteers did place multiple calls to 911. through the rainy day and the frigid night, no emergency services arrived.   “without us volunteers everybody would have died. everybody would have died,” one volunteer responding to the situation said. “with no tarps, no rain gear, no food, and no water, 300 adults, elders, and children could have died from exposure. we were a group of 8-15 volunteers triaging 300 people, trying to prevent hundreds of deaths. we cannot keep this up. we are not meant for this. we need bigger resources and responses.”  there are still hundreds of people stranded along the wall, waiting to be picked up by border patrol.

 a new report shows skyrocketing deaths in el paso, new mexico border region
 melissa del bosque, the border chronicle, 9 april 2024 
as safe corridors for migration disappear, more people risk their lives crossing the u.s.-mexico border. and more people die. a new report by the nonprofit no more deaths, along with a searchable map and database, documents the increasing number of migrant deaths at the border in new mexico and far west texas. until now, not much research has been done on the deaths of people migrating through this section of the border. the project was led by bryce, a no more deaths volunteer (who asked that we not use his last name because the far right has recently been targeting the group). he, along with several others, have created the most comprehensive database to date of deaths in the border patrol’s el paso sector, which includes new mexico and two counties in texas, el paso and hudspeth. 
the report covers 15 years, from 2008 to 2023, and it shows many disturbing trends, including the acceleration of deaths that has accompanied “prevention through deterrence,” the u.s. government’s strategy implemented in the 1990s to push migrants into more remote, dangerous crossings. that strategy is now morphing into something all the more tragic as people, increasingly women and children, are barred from accessing asylum and are dying at the doorstep of american cities and towns. in this q&a, bryce talks about documenting these deaths, and the discoveries that both shocked and angered him in creating this new report.

groups: cbp undercounting migrant deaths on the border
julian resendiz, border report, 8 april 2024 
el paso, texas – a regional humanitarian nonprofit says the federal government is undercounting migrant deaths and continues to engage in practices such as chases of suspected smugglers that result in third-party fatalities.
research published in march by the arizona-based no more deaths shows two to four times as many migrants died in west texas and southern new mexico in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020 than reported by the government. the deaths resulted from dehydration or hypothermia (depending on the season), falls from mountains or the border wall, drownings, being struck by motor vehicles and being injured during law-enforcement chases.
the group attributes the undercount – which it documents case-by-case in a public database with more than 400 deaths – to insufficient follow-up with hospitals, local police and medical examiners after border agents or officers come upon injured parties or skeletal remains.

migrants in sasabe stuck in freezing temps overnight, including families
danyelle khmara, azpm news, 13 february 2024
people began crossing the border friday, in a remote area east of sasabe, including many families with children.
aid volunteer bryce peterson says border patrol only picked up a limited number of people, so aid groups began bringing migrants to the border patrol station in sasabe.
“throughout the course of the night another 200 people had showed up,” peterson said. “so we were dealing with about 400 people who were all freezing cold, wet from being snowed and rained on. all the people that had been walking throughout the night were in really bad shape.”
migrants have been crossing in that remote area for months, and aid groups are asking border patrol to set up a warming station and processing center in the remote area and increase processing capacity at the station in sasabe.
seemingly at odds with the aid workers’ account, customs and border protection says they prioritized the humanitarian response to the migrants abandoned in the cold, triaged the situation and prioritized the most vulnerable migrants for transportation.
by sunday morning, all the migrants had been taken into border patrol custody. there were no serious medical emergencies or deaths reported.
