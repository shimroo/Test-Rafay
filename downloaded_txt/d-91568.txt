 “ "the best thing i did during the pandemic was a buy a nordic hot tub. this thing is awesome. i don’t know why i didn’t get one before!" molly k. “ “we bought a tub from viscount 14 years ago and gave it to my son before moving out of state. we moved back to michigan 8 years later and the tub is still working perfectly! we went through 3 different hot tubs during our time away. i can’t believe they all broke, we should’ve just bought another nordic!” michael a. “ "i bought a nordic sport in 2003. it's still working great and looking good too 18 years later. only thing i have replaced is a bearing and an "o" ring. i will purchase another nordic if this one ever wears out! thanks for making such a dependable product." diane s.
