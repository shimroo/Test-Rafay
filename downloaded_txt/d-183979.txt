quotable


"why must she dress that way? i think she's confused about her gender with all these big, baggy menswear tailored pantsuits.  no, i'm really serious.  they're unflattering. well, if her pants didn't stop an inch above her ankle, she could hide the cankle! i have great respect for her intellect and her tenacity and for what she does for our country in her governmental role.  i just wish she could send a stronger message about american fashion."

gaga steals from bette?


bette midler was less than impressed when lady gaga rolled onto stage in a wheelchair and dressed as a mermaid in a show last week in australia. 
"i've been doing singing mermaid in a wheelchair since 1980-you can keep the meat dress and the firecracker t--s," midler toldgaga in one of several tweets. "mermaid's mine." 
but soon midler has a change of heart. in another tweet, she wrote, "let's drink this over at the emmys in september. fabulous mermaids can coexist!"

quotable


"my boys love to eat crickets. it's their favorite thing. when i first gave it to them . . . i wanted them not to be turned off by something that was of their culture. they ate them like doritos, and they wouldn't stop. they brought to-go boxes home and i had to actually ban the cricket eating at a certain point because i was afraid they were going to get sick from too many."
