determining essential factors required for expediting neural induction of precursors to retinal organoids



jan 22, 2025




vision impairments affect over 2.2 billion people worldwide. the most physiologically accurate human retina models are retinal organoids (ros) — stem cell-derived structures containing the major cell types found in the human retina. however, the current protocol for deriving ros from stem cells is highly labor-intensive and involves a time-consuming neural induction period. in this study, we investigated an alternative differentiation protocol that could decrease the neural induction period from two weeks to four days and elucidate the essential parameters, such as seeding density, required for neural induction of ros. expediting the neural induction of ro progenitors can be applied to improve efficiency in the differentiation of ros.we characterized ro progenitors using gene expression data from qpcr and by visual inspection with bright-field microscopy. although seeding density has historically been shown to affect gene expression in the culture of ocular cells, seeding density did not significantly (p > .05) impact the gene expression or morphology of cells at the tested time points of differentiation. cells on day 4 (d4) of differentiation demonstrated morphology and neural gene expression (pax6 and lhx2) characteristic of neural cells. additionally, transferring cells from adherent culture to suspension culture on day 2 (d2) instead of d4 of this differentiation yielded intact neural spheres with a phase-bright outer ring and defined borders after 14 days of culture. therefore, these results indicate that our alternative differentiation protocol successfully expedited the neural induction of ro progenitors. these results will contribute to the establishment of a more efficient neural induction when generating ros, which may expedite the production of ro-based retinal therapies.

press release: atelocollagen in 3d culture models points to treatment of ​​osteoarthritis



jan 13, 2024




when it comes to the medical field, 3d modeling has previously been used to render anatomical images in greater detail in order to better understand bodily functions. lately, however, 3d modeling has made waves in depicting diseases, with a focus on their severity and progression. unlike a model depicting computer graphics, 3d culture models allow cells to interact in three dimensions and better display cell growth and movement, according to the food and drug administration. culture models are beneficial in replicating the complexities of disease by promoting interactions between cells and providing insight into potential solutions. in this issue of the journal of young investigators, priscilla detwieler and her colleagues demonstrate that atelocollagen incorporated in a 3d model is shown to simulate a potential treatment for inflammation-induced osteoarthritis.

advances in skin aging: delaying skin aging by targeting lymphoid-derived il-17 pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling



jan 13, 2024




over the past decade, there have been many significant advances in the field of skin aging, including studies that explore the clearance of senescent (growth-arrested) cells in skin, regenerative therapeutics, and even 3d bioprinting of skin. one of the latest discoveries showed that blocking interleukin 17 (il-17) signaling leads to delays in the skin aging process. but how does il-17, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, delay what has been known as the inevitable hallmarks of skin aging?

“stress as the foundation of suffering”: an interview with neuroscientist alexandra fiocco



oct 7, 2023




to combat the harmful effects of stress, neuroscientists are pointing to mindfulness, defined as the practice of being fully present and aware of our external environment and our actions, while not being overly reactive or overwhelmed by external events. to shed light on this, jyi interviewed renowned neuroscientist dr. alexandra fiocco, whose expertise lies at the intersection of mindfulness, stress, and cognitive aging. dr. fiocco currently does research at stress and healthy aging research (star) lab and teaches at toronto metropolitan university.
