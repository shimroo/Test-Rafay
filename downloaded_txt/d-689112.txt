even though we are only early into 2025, the beauty industry is fast and furious with the new releases; that means new nude lipsticks have launched, too. whether you're a fan of classic neutrals or seeking an updated twist, there's a shade for everyone. a nude lipstick is the little black dress of your makeup collection—timeless, versatile, and universally flattering. its magic lies in its ability to enhance your natural beauty, subtly elevating your look without overshadowing it. by mimicking the natural tones of your lips, a nude shade complements every skin tone. whether you’re rocking a dramatic smokey eye or going for a fresh, minimal makeup look, a nude lipstick can effortlessly ties everything together.one of the reasons a nude lipstick works for everyone is its variety of undertones. with options ranging from peachy and pink to beige and caramel, you can find a shade that harmonizes perfectly with your complexion. the right nude lipstick enhances your natural features, brightens your face, and transitions seamlessly between casual daytime moments and glamorous evenings out.every makeup bag deserves a collection of nude lipsticks, not just one. a soft pinky nude is ideal for daytime errands or brunch with friends, while a deeper caramel nude adds elegance to an evening night out look. nude lipsticks are also incredibly versatile for layering, making them the perfect base for lip liners, glosses, or even a touch of shimmer. and unlike trendy bold shades that come and go with the seasons, nude lipsticks are timeless and appropriate year-round, whether it’s a summer wedding or a cozy winter gathering.here's a list of the top 10 newly launched nude lipsticks to try.mac cosmetics macximal silky matte lipstick in cool teddya fresh addition to mac's lineup, cool teddy offers a rich, cool-toned nude in a silky matte finish, providing long-lasting wear without drying out the lips.tower 28 lipsoftie in red bean mochicelebrating the lunar new year, tower 28 introduces red bean mochi, a hydrating lip balm that imparts a sweet, subtle tint, ideal for a natural nude look.dolly beauty lipstick in birthday suitpart of dolly parton's debut beauty line, birthday suit is a nude shade housed in a crystal-adorned bullet, combining glamour with a universally flattering hue.mac cosmetics macximal sleek satin lipstick in fleshpotthis new shade delivers a neutral nude with a hint of warmth, perfect for everyday wear. the sleek satin finish ensures a comfortable, hydrating feel.dior addict lip glow soft nudedior's latest addition to their lip glow line in soft nude offers a warm-toned nude that enhances the natural color of your lips while providing deep hydration.makeup by mario hydrating supershine lip gloss barethis non-sticky gloss delivers a sheer nude tint, enriched with nourishing ingredients like sodium hyaluronate and jojoba oil for smoother, fuller lips.hourglass cosmetics volumizing glossy balm wandercombining the shine of a gloss with the nourishment of a balm, this product offers a nude shade that complements various skin tones, perfect for a polished look.e.l.f. skin suntouchable invisi-stick spf 50while primarily a sun protection stick, its subtle tint can double as a nude lip balm, providing both hydration and spf protection.lancôme l'absolu rouge drama matte in so dramatica rosy brown nude, this matte lipstick offers a bold yet wearable shade, perfect for those looking to venture beyond traditional nudes.mac cosmetics macximal silky matte lipstick in folioa re-released classic, folio is a gray-beige nude that gained fame in the '90s. its silky matte finish provides a modern update to this iconic shade.do you have a hard time finding your perfect nude lipstick? look for a shade slightly deeper than your natural lip color. if your lips have cooler undertones, opt for nudes with hints of pink or mauve. if they’re warmer, peach or caramel hues will look most flattering. with their effortless beauty and versatility, nude lipsticks are more than just a makeup item—they’re a beauty essential that can help you achieve a flawless look every time.have you discovered any new nude lipsticks yet this year? share your favorites in the comments!

jones road beauty what the foundation review: a tinted moisture balm for the real skin look

if you’re a fan of a natural, dewy complexion, then you’ve likely heard the buzz around jones road beauty’s what the foundation. i recently put this tinted moisture balm to the test, and spoiler alert, it’s found a spot in my makeup bag. here’s everything you need to know about this unique product and why i’m loving it.jones road beauty describes what the foundation as a tinted moisture balm, and honestly, that’s the perfect way to explain it. it’s not quite a traditional foundation, and it’s not just a tinted moisturizer. instead, it’s a hybrid product that combines skincare benefits with a sheer tint to give your skin a healthy, luminous glow. the formula is designed to be hydrating, lightweight, and buildable, with a finish that lets your real skin shine through, imperfections and all.this product is all about enhancing your natural beauty rather than masking it.when i first opened the jar, i’ll admit i was a little skeptical. the texture is rich and creamy, almost like a balm, and i wasn’t sure how it would work on my skin with my skincare heavy routine. but after experimenting a bit, i’ve fallen for how what the foundation performs.i’ve found that the best way to apply what the foundation is with a dense foundation brush. i use a stippling technique, gently pressing the product into my skin rather than swiping. this method helps to build coverage exactly where i need it while keeping the overall finish natural and seamless. for me, it’s all about concentrating on areas that need more coverage—think redness around the nose or uneven tone on the cheeks.













choosing the right shade was a bit of trial and error. i initially purchased two shades: light and beige. while light was a touch too fair for me, it ended up being the perfect match for my sister, so it didn’t go to waste. beige, on the other hand, was spot-on for my skin tone. if you’re in between shades, i recommend buying two and mixing or sharing with a friend or family member—it’s worth the effort to get that perfect match.what sets this product apart is the finish. it’s dewy, fresh, and gives your skin that “just-had-a-facial” glow. the coverage is sheer to medium, but it’s buildable if you want to even out specific areas. i love how it blurs imperfections without feeling heavy or cakey.as someone who’s loyal to foundations like this bobbi brown fave, my go-to from giorgio armani beauty or longtime favorite from it cosmetics, i’ll admit what the foundation is totally different. those other products offer all different but more traditional coverage and finishes, while this one is all about that “no-makeup” makeup vibe. still, i can see myself reaching for this balm on days when i want a quick, effortless look with a radiant finish.purchase jones road beauty what the foundation directly from their website jonesroadbeauty.com. the price point is reasonable at $44, especially considering the multitasking benefits it offers. a little goes a long way, so the jar should last a good while.
