and that any model (eg the bible) is a humanfiction which must be tested against reality before it can betrusted. my questions struck at the heart of catholic belief. the roman catholic church is an authoritarian institution that claims the right to control humanminds. it employs only true believers, so i was asked to leave the order natural theology  galileo openedour eyes to the 'book of nature'. this book assumed critical importance for theological modelling when darwin's origin of species provided an explanation for our origins at least as plausible as the book of genesis. darwin, genesis  so, let us assume that for all practical purposes, god and our universe are one and the same, so that the book of nature is also the book of theology. that is to say, the universe lives its own life and is not the product of some outside creator. we live within it, members of god. what follows? first, a radical revision of catholic theology. christianity is a mystery religion. there is no evidence for it, people must accept its claims on blind faith.  on the other hand, if the universe is divine theology can become a science in the modern sense of the word. natural theology (think natural science) may consider every thought, feeling, action or event in the whole universe as revelation from and of god. the data for natural theology are everything that happens, a vast treasury that outweighs countless ancient texts. looking back, we see that these ancient texts are the work of many authors trying to understand the divine world in they found themselves. the catholic church (through its various agents) did a good job of inhibiting me, but i am slowly breaking free and letting my lust for life flow. this is unlikely to do too much damage in my aging condition, but i do feel a prophetic urge in me to propagate my theological idea now that it seems to me to be sound. an evidence based theology seems capable of yielding great benefits to peaceful human union and our collective power of survival by providing a firm foundation for our dealings with god (our universe). my revelation is that everything is revelation of god. (revised 29 december 2018)         copyright: you may copy this material freely provided only that you quote fairly and provide a link (or reference) to your source.    please click here to buy a copy of my book and support this project      please click here to buy a copy of my book and support this project     please click here to  buy a copy of my book and support this project          please click here to  buy a copy of this book and support this project           please click here to  buy a copy of my book and support this project          please click here to  buy a copy of this book and support this project           please click here to buy a copy of my book and support this project           further reading books click on the "amazon" link below each book entry to see details of a book (and possibly buy it!)  axelrod, robert,  the evolution of cooperation, basic books, reised edition  2006   'the evolution of cooperation provides valuable insights into the age-old question of whether unforced cooperation is ever possible. widely praised and much-discussed, this classic book explores how cooperation can emerge in a world of self-seeking egoists-whether superpowers, businesses, or individuals-when there is no central authority to police their actions. the problem of cooperation is central to many different fields. robert axelrod recounts the famous computer tournaments in which the âcooperativeâ program tit for tat recorded its stunning victories, explains its application to a broad spectrum of subjects, and suggests how readers can both apply cooperative principles to their own lives and teach cooperative principles to others.'   amazon   back  cantor, georg,  contributions to the founding of the theory of transfinite numbers (translated, with introduction and notes by philip e b jourdain), dover  1955   jacket: 'one of the greatest mathematical classics of all time, this work established a new field of mathematics which was to be of incalculable importance in topology, number theory, analysis, theory of functions, etc, as well as the entire field of modern logic.'   amazon   back  cummins, denise dellarosa, and colin allen (editors),  the evolution of mind, oxford university press  1998   introduction: 'this book is an interdisciplinary endeavour, a collection of essays by ethologists, psychologists, anthropologists and philosophers united in the common goal of explaining cognition. . . . the chief challenge is to make evolutionary psychology into an experimental science.  several of the chapters in this volume describe experimental techniques and results consistent with this aim;
