quotient club

since life
is often
stranger than fiction, this fiction will have you guessing how
fictional it really is! filled with aviation junkies details about the
world of "fractional aircraft owndership", it weaves a winding webs of
intrigue into mysterious deaths, a sexy newspaper journalist
writing about the "rich and their toys" with inferences of mafia
involvement
and greedy corporate moguls. ironically, this was written before the
events of the last few years... but it almost has a prophetic outcome! 
soft
cover, illustrated, indexed, 239
pages

every day, we
are reminded of the importance of preserving the freedom of
flight. not only as a tool of transportation and the ultimate means of
higher
education, but  just as much for fun. flying brings joy and a full
life for those who share this passion for
all things that strange-ly enough, fly like birds!
