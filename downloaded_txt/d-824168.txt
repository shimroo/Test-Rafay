the technology leader in hermetic seal inspection




norcom systems inc. is the exclusive manufacturer of optical leak test systems for fine and gross leak inspection of hermetically sealed components. our advanced technology has made us the leader in leak test technology for over twenty years.
all systems manufactured comply with the updated requirements of military standards 883 and 750 for both gross and fine leak inspection





how optical leak testing works




optical leak testing (olt) images the lid deflection of the package under pressure with a very sensitive full field interferometer, and determines the change in internal pressure of a leaking device reporting both the pass/fail status and leak rate of the device automatically.
olt technology is used for metal, ceramic, glass, and silicone lidded devices. the systems can inspect devices on a circuit board, wafer or mounted to a substrate.
