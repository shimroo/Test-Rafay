          who we are
        

          championing lgbtq issues in k-12 education since 1990
        

          glsen works to ensure that lgbtq students are able to learn and grow in a school environment free from bullying and harassment. together we can transform our nation's schools into the safe and affirming environment all youth deserve.
        




 



          our work
        

glsen believes that every student has the right to a safe, supportive, and lgbtq-inclusive k-12 education. we are a national network of educators, students, and local glsen chapters working to make this right a reality.
our research and experience has shown that there are four major ways that schools can cultivate a safe and supportive environment for all of their students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.
