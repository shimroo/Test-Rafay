book #19 - frankenstein: a cultural history (susan tyler hitchcock)


apr. 6th, 2008 at 7:59 am



 


jennylucastitle: frankenstein: a cultural historyauthor: susan tyler hitchcock# of pages: 325rating: 3/5started: march 26, 2008finished: march 31, 2008total books: 19/75 (25%)total pages: 5,967/20,000 (30%)next up: streets of laredo (larry mcmurtry)synopsis from barnes & noble: frankenstein began as the nightmare of an unwed teenage mother in geneva, switzerland, in 1816. at a time when the moral universe was shifting and advances in scientific knowledge promised humans dominion over that which had been god's alone, mary shelley envisioned a story of human presumption and its misbegotten consequences. two centuries later, that story is still constantly retold and reinterpreted, from halloween cartoons to ominous allusions in the public debate, capturing and conveying meaning central to our consciousness today and our concerns for tomorrow. from victorian musical theater to boris karloff with neck bolts, to invocations at the president's council on bioethics, the monster and his myth have inspired everyone from cultural critics to comic book addicts. this is a lively and eclectic cultural history, illuminated with dozens of pictures and illustrations, and told with skill and humor. susan tyler hitchcock uses film, literature, history, science, and even punk music to help us understand the meaning of this monster made by man.my thoughts: very, very interesting.  the author looks at how the frankenstein "monster" was created.  by that, i mean how frankenstein - the book, the man, and the monster - came to be as popular (and misunderstood) as it is today.  it's a little dry at times, and the author skips around in time a bit, making it somewhat confusing.   still a very good book.  recommended.

cradles to crayons


mar. 25th, 2008 at 10:15 pm



 


jennylucasthree women from my home team and i volunteered tonight at this amazing organization called cradles to crayons.  they collect clothes, toys, and books for children, and then social workers and other people who work with needy kids can call them up and request a pack of stuff.  for example, if someone calls them and says they have a five-year-old boy who needs some clothes and toys, they will put together a bag with a week's worth of five-year-old boy clothes and some age-appropriate books and toys.  the social worker can then come pick up the bag and deliver it to the child.we had a lot of fun.  our job tonight was sorting clothes - taking them out of the bags they came donated in and sorting them by "the four ss" - stain, size, season, sex.  anything that had any sort of stain was put into a bag for the purple heart.  (cradles has very, very high standards when it comes to the clothes they give out to the children.  as the girl we met with tonight explained it, they want the kids to not feel that they are getting secondhand clothes.)  then the clothes are sorted by size, season, and sex.  there were boxes for anywhere between 0-6 months (summer and winter) through i think 12 years (also summer and winter).it was such a great experience.  i really hope we go back sometime.  they have volunteer hours during the day but, as of now, they only have evening volunteer hours on tuesdays, but when/if they add more during the week, i will definitely make it a priority to volunteer more.please, if any of you in the area (they are located in horsham, pennsylvania) have the time, try to volunteer for a day.  it will definitely change your outlook on things.  if you can't donate your time, please try to donate any clothes, books, or toys for kids who don't have any.  they also take baby equipment, diapers, and hygiene products.check out the website.  it's a wonderful organization.

my son the fashion maven


mar. 14th, 2008 at 3:08 pm



 


jennylucas imagine, if you will (since i didn't think to take a picture), the outfit my son picked out this morning.ratatouille t-shirtblack and gray camouflage pantsred and white socks with baseballs, soccer balls, and footballs on themgreen camouflage sneakersand topping it all off:white dress shirt, buttoned all the way upblue and red clip-on tiehe wanted to wear the dress shirt and tie because he wanted to look like a "work guy" but he also wanted to wear a shirt underneath because the dress shirt "tickled his tummy."  the camo pants and socks were his idea as well.i let him wear it to school because i'm trying to encourage his sense of self and his individuality.  someday, he will need therapy because i let him wear camo pants with a dress shirt.and in other news, i started a blog at blogger. the address is: http://quitethehuman.blogspot.com/ there is really no reason for any of you to go there since i'll be posting there pretty much what i post here.  but i thought i'd share the wealth anyway.
