i last did something like this about two years ago.  well the list has changed somewhat, and my desire for hockey players has grown significantly over the past two years.  this time around i've left off the dead musicians (cobain, tupac, strummer just to name a few), but the cookies have stayed.  this list is overrun by hockey players and by men called jason.  just click on the names to view sexy pictures and my reasoning behind my choices (and remember, sometimes beauty comes from within)...#50 - colin hanks#49 - marc - andré bergeron#48 - jay leno#47 - bam margera#46 - alex trebek#45 - rick gomez#44 - ethan embry#43 - yoji harada#42 - james blunt#41 - oreo cookies#40 - jason statham#39 - alexander ovechkin#38 - hawksley workman#37 - giovanni ribisi#36 - jason biggs#35 - alexandre despatie#34 - scott caan#33 - jason lee#32 - dwayne roloson#31 - rex murphy#30 - raffi torres#29 - jason london#28 - ian hanomansing#27 - ed robertson#26 - eugene hutz#25 - dallas green#24 - chris garver#23 - david gray#22 - patrick demspey#21 - anze kopitar#20 - ian rosenberger#19 - rick mercer#18 - mike morrison#17 - yuri lemeshev#16 - john cusack#15 - ryan gosling#14 - colin firth#13 - anson carter#12 - josh groban#11 - tom gilbert#10 - dan savage#9 - tim mcilrath#8 - george stroumboulopoulos#7 - daniel tjarnqvist#6 - nicolas wright#5 - goran visnjic#4 - ryan miller#3 - johnny depp#2 - edward norton#1 - igor ulanov

i want to go on a date to the zoo. our zoo is not a particularly nice zoo, but it is a zoo nonetheless. and i'd like to go there. unless my date is willing to drive to the calgary zoo, because it's much better.also, i'd like to make a declaration to myself, because i'm the only one who reads my blog and even i have not looked at it quite a while. if the oilers win the stanley cup, i will get an oilers-themed tattoo. probably on my ribs.i'm hungry. hungry for brind'amour's blood.oilers = hollersthemed = teamedbrind'amour = brandenburg

	 concert review: our lady peace
	 
    


i went to rexall place for the second night in a row on tuesday.  monday, i was there to see the oilers destroy (well...beat, anyway) the detroit red wings.  it was a great night.  tuesday was less great.  it was still fine, don't get me wrong, but it was nothing compared to monday's victory...with the entire arena chanting "manny! manny!" and most everyone was in unison, a rare occurence.  anywhoo, i saw our lady peace play on tuesday night.  they were...a step up from mediocre, i'd say.  i saw them three years ago in the same venue.  they used a lot of the same "you're our friends, not our fans" bullshit which made it seem even more phony the second time around.good things about the concert:1. there were no cheesy nickleback-esque pyrotechnics.2. rexall was made into a half bowl, so pretty much any seat was a good seat.3. after references about the oilers' previous night victory, the crowd would break out into "let's go oilers *clap* *clap* *clap-clap-clap*" and the band would have to wait a few seconds before the crowd would stop.4. raine maida climbed into the audience.5. maybe he wasn't drunk.bad things about the concert:1. they didn't play thief or life.2. they played songs from their new album, which was to be expected.3. everything they said sounded phony.4. the sound was really bad...a lot of the time i couldn't even hear his voice.5. he let the crowd sing 4am in its entirety and of course people don't seem to know the second verse.  if we come to a concert, we want to hear the band play.6. everyone started cheering as if it was the end of the song before the "doesn't anybody ever know, the world's a subway," portion of superman's dead.7. the whole concert was very similar to their 2003 live cd, but less good.8. it wasn't worth $56.75.  end of story.5 songs olp should play at concerts but never do anymore:1. neon crossing (naveed, 1994)2. dirty walls (naveed, 1994)3. blister (happiness...is not a fish you can catch, 1999)4. made to heal (spiritual machines, 2000)5. oskar (clumsy, 1997)
