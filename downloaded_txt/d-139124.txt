what we believe





1
we believe the bible to be the
        "word of god". 


2
we believe that jesus christ is
        the son of god.


3
we believe that jesus was - born
        of the virgin mary - died for our sins on calvary's cross - rose again on the third day -
        is seated on the right hand of god the father.


4
we believe that the lord will
        return again soon for his bride, the church. 


5
we believe that the holy ghost
        will teach, lead and guide us to do the will of god.
