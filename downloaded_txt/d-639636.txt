current series


 
















november 5th - october 26thwhere our treasure is, our hearts follow. so, it shouldn’t surprise us that 11 of jesus’ 39 parables involved the topic of money. god cares deeply about our hearts, and our approach to our finances provides a window into the condition of our spiritual lives and to whom we give our worship.join us for this four-week series as we discuss what jesus had to say about money and so much more, and as we change our approach to our finances, our lives will be changed in the process.
