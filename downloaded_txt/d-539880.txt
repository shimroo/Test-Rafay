reviews












hello! i am a research associate for the everglades science center under the national audubon society (non-profit). our work consists of conducting research on roseate spoonbill nesting, prey fish research, submerged aquatic vegetation and hydrology patterns all throughout florida bay and everglades national park. we love flying fisherman's. mainly because of its functionality and price point. it is perfect for our rugged and dirty work but at a great price point.

 i just received my new flying fisherman sunglasses and wow! love these at first eye opening in the sun. love them!!!! and thank you.
michael s.






flying fisherman eyewear is a perfect fit for our educational efforts and for our participants. last year, i ordered two pair of sunglasses to see if they could compete with other brands i have been wearing for years. to my surprise, both performed exceedingly well, far above my expectations, and they have become my go to glasses before leaving the house. i was impressed how these sunglasses sharpened my visual acuity and eliminated the glare allowing me to see deep into the water and spot fish.  i experienced no eye strain and more importantly, they do not slide down my nose while on the water.

shane wilson, founder fishingsfuture.org






flying fisherman sunglasses are the best and have helped me to compete on the water through all kinds of conditions. flying fisherman also has sunbandits pro face mask and pro series gloves which are great products that have helped to protect me from the sun’s harmful rays.

i started to wear my new ff sunglasses on friday you gave them to me and have not put them down (except of my bed). they are great!!! i have seen so much fish in rivers, lakes and a dam in the czech republic i couldn't believe it (i looked with glasses, without, with again and what a difference). fishing has been double pleasure since. i caught my best carp on sunday with your sunglasses
