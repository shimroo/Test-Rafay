what our clients say about us... 

































tanya helped us sell our longboat key home during a difficult time of loss. she is extremely kind and caring. she is also patient, knowledgeable and professional. we will always be deeply thankful for her help and kindness. she also was able to get us top dollar which definitely did not hurt! we recommend tanya and would suggest her to anyone! tanya is not only our local agent, she is also now our family friend. thank you tanya!





the andersen family

































my husband and i had the pleasure of working with tanya for our real estate purchase in bradenton in 2021.  we had a wonderful experience with tanya.  she pursued our questions and followed up on the details and remedies of the inspection report.  we were able to buy sight unseen (as we lived out of state at the time) with the trust we placed in her. we are now 3 years into our home and could not be happier living in florida. trusting your agent to give you timely answers is critical.  in today’s market there are many agents but none better than tanya. thank you tanya for making the process so seamless. 





carmen and kirk

































to say that tanya is an excellent realtor is an understatement. she takes time to care for her clients, understand their needs, and work passionately, to ensure they can either buy the house of their dreams or sell their house for the best price possible. her reliability is off the charts amazing and her understanding of the market is powerful. don’t pause for a second when considering whether or not tanya is your realtor. she is amazing!

anna maria islandholmes beachbradenton & bradenton beach 


























a beautiful gulfside community
anna maria island, sometimes called anna maria key, is a barrier island on the coast of manatee county, florida in the united states. it is bounded on the west by the gulf of mexico, on the south by longboat pass (which separates it from longboat key), on the east by anna maria sound, and on the north by tampa bay. anna maria island is approximately seven miles long north to south. anna maria island is at latitude 27.513n, longitude -82.719w. a nautical chart of the island and surrounding waters may be seen here




the island was originally used for hunting and fishing by various indian tribes and the only way on and off the island was by boat. visit the anna maria island historical society for a look at this island paradise in its original form when it was discovered by the local timucan and caloosan american indian tribes and then by spanish explorers (including hernando desoto) in the name of the spanish crown. 







 











attractions
there’s lots to do on anna maria island and the surrounding areas. check out special events and local information here. the gulf of mexico is also an awesome body of water that surrounds most of anna maria island and is fantastic for fishing !
