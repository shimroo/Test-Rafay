welcome to the church of the redeemer!we hold services at 8am (spoken) 10am (organ & choir) and 5pm (choral evensong) every sunday.  nursery care is provided for children under 3 years old, and sunday school classes are offered for children ages 3 through grade 7.  all are welcome!



worship
our worship services, both in person and online are places where we find refuge from the changes and chances of life.
we welcome worshippers into the sanctuary on sundays at 8am (spoken), 10am and 5pm.click here for sunday's leaflets.


learn
no matter our age, we can always go deeper with god. the church of the redeemer offers opportunities to learn and grow for people of all ages – beginning at age three and up!

serve
as we grow in our love for god, we also grow in our love of neighbor. acting on this love is an important part of christian community, and the redeemer offers many ways to do this together.


upcomingour annual chili, bread and soup cook-off has been rescheduled for shrove tuesday, march 4th from 5-7pm.  bring your favorite chili, bread or soup to share, and we'll celebrate a shrove tuesday supper together (games included)!  see you in the parish hall on march 4th at 5pm! 


 










fellowship 
one of the great things about community life is the chance to have fellowship, to celebrate together and support each other in difficult times. the church of the redeemer offers a variety of events where people ages 1 to 100 can eat and play together, to mark some of the significant days in the christian year.



musicmusic plays an important role in the life of our parish. we invite all members of our parish to be involved in our music. from joyous hymn singing in the pews or the glorious sounds of our magnificent new schoenstein pipe organ to the refined splendor of weekly choral evensong, music is an integral part of our worship.


strategic ministries
engaging the parish to develop and nurture programs and relationships that further the mission of the church of the redeemer within its walls and beyond by serving those in need and forming disciples of christ.
donate to one of our many outreach programs.
