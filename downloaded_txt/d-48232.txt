				mums			

chrysanthemums (mums):

origin: native to east asia, particularly china and japan.
history: chrysanthemums have been cultivated in china as a flowering herb as far back as the 15th century bce. highly symbolic in east asian cultures, they represent longevity and vitality.
cultivation: mums are photoperiodic plants, meaning their flowering is triggered by the shorter days and longer nights experienced in the fall.


best practices:

soil: prefer well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter.
watering: keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. overwatering can lead to root rot.
sunlight: mums require plenty of sunlight to thrive. aim for at least 5-6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
fertilization: feed with a balanced fertilizer designed for flowering plants every 6 to 8 weeks until the buds begin to open.
pinching: pinch back tips and disbud to encourage bushier growth and more blooms.
overwintering: in colder climates, mulch heavily after the ground freezes to protect roots or bring potted mums indoors before the first frost.

				fall hurley pot color bowl			

general care for fall color bowls:

composition: often include a variety of plants selected for their compatibility in growth needs and for their vibrant fall colors.
common plants: may include pansies, chrysanthemums, ornamental kale, ornamental peppers, and other fall-friendly plants.

best practices:

soil: use a high-quality, well-draining potting mix suitable for container gardening.
watering: keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. container plants can dry out quickly, especially in windy or sunny conditions, so check moisture levels frequently.
sunlight: most fall plants need full to partial sunlight to thrive—around 4-6 hours of direct sunlight per day is ideal.
fertilization: use a balanced, slow-release fertilizer at planting time. you might not need to fertilize again if the display is meant to last only for the fall season.
temperature and protection: while many fall plants are frost-tolerant, sudden severe frosts or snow can damage them. if an unexpected frost is forecast, consider covering the plants or
moving the container to a sheltered location.
pruning and maintenance: deadhead spent flowers to encourage continued blooming and remove any yellowing or dead leaves to keep the arrangement looking fresh.
this setup not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of outdoor spaces during the cooler months but also takes advantage of the cooler weather to display plants that thrive in fall conditions.

				pansy pots			


pansy pots:

origin: hybridization of several species in the genus viola, particularly viola tricolor.
history: pansies have been cultivated since the early 19th century in england and became popular for their wide range of colors and patterns.
cultivation: pansies are cool-weather plants, often planted in the early spring or fall.

best practices:

				house plant pack			

houseplant begonias:

origin: tropical and subtropical regions, primarily south and central america, africa, and southern asia.
history: widely cultivated as ornamental plants due to their colorful flowers and leaves.
cultivation: diverse genus with many species adapted to different environments, ranging from full shade to indirect sunlight conditions.

best practices:

soil: light, well-draining soil with good organic content.
watering: allow the topsoil to dry out between waterings. avoid watering directly onto the leaves to prevent leaf rot.
sunlight: prefers bright, indirect sunlight; direct sun can scorch the leaves.
harvesting: not typically harvested, but pruning helps maintain shape and encourages fuller growth.


aglaonema assorted:

origin: native to tropical and subtropical regions of asia and new guinea.
history: known for its easy care and the ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it popular for indoor use.
cultivation: often used in interiorscapes due to its tolerance to less-than-ideal conditions like low light and dry air.

best practices:

soil: well-draining potting soil.
watering: keep the soil lightly moist but not wet; reduce watering in the winter.
sunlight: thrives in low to bright indirect sunlight; too much direct sun can cause leaf burn.
harvesting: generally not harvested, but old or yellowing leaves should be removed to keep the plant healthy.


ctenanthe assorted (part of the marantaceae family):

origin: native to tropical regions of central and south america, particularly brazil.
history: ctenanthe plants, closely related to calathea and maranta, are known for their striking leaf patterns and have been popular in indoor plant collections for their decorative leaves.
cultivation: these plants thrive in a humid, tropical-like environment, which makes them ideal for indoor cultivation under the right conditions.

best practices:

soil: use a well-draining, light, and airy potting mix, ideally one that retains moisture without becoming soggy. a mixture of potting soil, peat, and perlite usually works well.
watering: keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. water when the top inch of soil feels dry. ctenanthe plants are sensitive to fluoride and chlorine in tap water, which can cause
leaf tip burn, so use distilled or non-chlorinated water if possible.
sunlight: prefers bright, indirect light. direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, while too little light can cause the vibrant leaf colors to fade.
humidity: requires high humidity to thrive. regular misting, a pebble tray, or a humidifier can help maintain an ideal environment.
temperature: best kept at temperatures between 65°f and 80°f (18°c to 27°c). avoid drafts and sudden temperature changes.
fertilization: feed with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every month during the growing season (spring and summer), reducing to every other month in the fall and winter.
pruning and maintenance: prune back any dead or yellowing leaves to encourage new growth and keep the plant looking its best. regularly clean the leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and help the plant breathe.



these care tips should help keep your ctenanthe plants healthy and vibrant, showcasing their unique foliage as part of your indoor garden.

starting the afternoon of tuesday, october 17, 2023, students will have one username and password for all ftcc resources including student email.
login credentials for all ftcc resources will be your active directory (ad) username and password. this is also what you are currently using to log into self-service, blackboard, e-trieve, and other ftcc online services, including campus computers and wi-fi.
in addition, multi-factor authentication (mfa) is coming november 1,2023. you may start the enrollment process at any time by visiting multi-factor authentication directions. the college has selected the microsoft authenticator app for students. you may also setup your microsoft self service password reset (sspr) to assist with resetting your password in the future without having to contact the it service desk.
the blackboard login process is also changing on october 17, 2023 for anyone with an ftcc email account. there will be a selection below the login button that reads “sign in with third-party account”. make this selection and then choose “ftcc ad login”.
whenever you encounter the login screen pictured below, enter your full email address with your ad password to authenticate. i.e. xxxxxxx####@student.faytechcc.edu
