     a post for some reason
     
    


just for the novelty of it.as a follow up to my previous post, i ended up buying a 7710 ford with a cab and 4wd. loved it until i somehow managed to burn up the transmission whilst mowing hay back in june. it's been in the shop ever since, because every time we think it's fixed, something else screws up. the temptation is getting pretty strong to see how much trade-in i can get on it.i do hope to have it back in the next few days (now that hay season is over and i don't need it anymore).speaking of farming though, i get an amazing amount of farmville requests on facebook... which i ignore of course. i wonder how much it will piss people off if i were to tell them "if i want to play farmville, i'll go across the road and get on one of my f%#@^*g tractors"

     tractor shopping (again)
     
    


the 285 is just not cutting it anymore. the deutz finally laid down and died and will most likely be going the happy hunting ground/great tractor scrapyard in the sky sometime in the near future. the 3600 just doesn't have the hp to handle my larger equipment, so it's time to upgrade.i'm looking at fords (of course!), but i will admit i that i have also been looking at new machines as well. of all of the new machines i've looked at, i have too say that the case/ih farmalls seem to be the best machines to suit my needs. i'm not real crazy about any of the other brands i've looked at. some of the new hollands are ok, but they have so many freaking model numbers i'm at loss to figure out what is what (plus they quit making the tb series that i liked).as for the fords, bigger brother and i went riding around today and looked at a 7810, a 7610 and a 5610, all 4wd and at various prices. the only one i could get really excited about was the 7610, but it did not have remote hydraulics, which i need and would no doubt cost a small fortune. the 5610 was the cheapest, but it had some issues that are probably more than i want to tackle. part of the reason i'm concentrating on fords is because i just happen to have a ford quick-attach loader that i can bolt right on a 10 series utility tractor (the 7810 is a mite iffy since it has a 6-cylinder engine... it may be too long to fit the loader).all of the loader concerns went out the window when we stopped to look at contestant #4... a 7710 w/cab (and working air), which may turn out to be the best of the lot. photos may follow if i can get them off my phone....

     redneck engineering- chapter xxvii
     
    


i have one of the little cheap 55 gallon sprayers. the booms on it were only 6' wide (giving me a total 12' spray pattern), which is just too small for pastures (in my opinion anyway), so a while back i bought a boomjet® boomless spray nozzle and ditched the booms. with this contraption, i now have a 30' (give or take a couple of feet) spray pattern.one little problem... my sprayer's design was not conducive to installing said spray nozzle upon it, so i had to find a workaround.my solution was 3 u-bolts and a piece of angle iron, with an old bicycle inner tube wrapped around the pipe to keep it from vibrating loose. not a pretty job, but if it were, it would hardly qualify as a redneck engineering post would it?

     hayfield photos
     
    


the reason my neck hurts all summer... the 275 is a jam-up baler to be as old as it is (late 60's, early 70's) and i find it interesting that it has leprosy pretty bad in the bale chamber and still makes a good bale.same field a couple of weeks later, this was the half acre or so that was too wet to mow when i square baled. this is one of my neighbors who came to help me out since the ford was dead at the time and i had nothing to roll with. i am very fortunate in the friends and neighbors that i have.

     a new toy
     
    


i bought a drobo to use as a file server. i'm hoping it will work better than the raid array that i have now. the only problem i'm having is that time machine doesn't want to work and i am in the midst of reinstalling leopard. i hope it doesn't take as long to "de-archive" as it did to archive.

     it seems
     
    


my luck is running about the same as always. i took off early last thursday to mow and made about four rounds and noticed that there was fuel absolutely pouring out of the front fuel filter on the ferguson. for some reason one of the seals for the new filter failed. i've never had that happen before. wasn't that big of a problem to fix, but it knocked me out of an hours mowing time. a little later i started having problems with the belts spinning in thick grass and remembered that i had forgotten to loosen the tension on the belts last fall and they had probably stretched over the winter. naturally, i didn't have the right wrench in the toolbox, so i lost another half hour on that. finally got finished in the main field ('cept for about half an acre that is waaaay too wet) and made about a round and a half on the other field when it got dark on me. not a problem! i had the bright idea that i'd just get up early and mow it before i went to work, so the next morning i got up at 5am and headed to the field. as i was driving down the path to the field, i hit a rut and heard something go "pop" and the next thing i knew, the mower cutterbar was laying across the back wheel. it seems the weld in the main shaft that the mower pivots on* had broken. i wasn't able to get a new shaft until today, but i'm close to having the mower back together.i also had to get one of the neighbors to roll my hay for me, because i'm a moron of course. i started doing some work on the ford tractor just before hay season, thinking i'd have it back running in a day or so. nope! it's been sitting for over a month in many, many pieces and naturally, being the idiot that i am, i parked it right in front of my round baler....*the mower only pivots when you hit something hard enough to trip the breakaway. this is supposed to keep from damaging the mower, but all it seems to do to my mower is destroy the driveshaft every freaking time it trips. so, naturally of course, i had to do a little redneck engineering on it to keep that from happening.... that of course, will be a forthcoming redneck engineering™ post.

     this one probably qualifies as a redneck engineering post...
     
    


because of the lovely wooden "brackets" on the generator...although it may not look that big in this picture, that has got to be the largest briggs i've ever seen.

allllllllmost have the 3600 back together... need to bolt the radiator down, plug the wiring harness back in ( that is the result of another moron moment i had last fall which i will save for another time) and stick the nose back on.in the lawnmower world, i have parts and pieces of five pushmowers scattered around the barn and can't get any of the three (theoretically) "running" ones to crank... on the other hand, i have all of the weedwhackers working now.bigger brother slung a rod in his little terramite backhoe and charged me with the task of finding him another motor.... and boy did i ever. his only stipulations were that it be a "big" horizontal shaft engine. one of the neighbors has an ancient garden tractor with an huge single cylinder briggs on it that i think dates back to the sixties... the problem is, its so blasted huge, he doesn't think it will fit on the frame! there will be pictures to follow of this monstrosity...

     i'm getting dumber by the day
     
    


i've got the front end off the 3600 right, putting a new radiator and water pump on. not really that much of a chore, until my inner moron kicked in. i got the bright idea to clean some of the crud off the block while i had it exposed. sprayed 2 cans of good ole' gunk cleaner/degreaser on it, dragged the waterhose down there... and promptly filled the $^&%$ intake full of water.now, that isn't a good thing to do on any engine, but on a diesel it's velly, velly bad. sooooo, my relatively simple chore turned into a fairly involved project, because i had to pull the injectors and drain the oil. i thought i was going to have to pull the manifold too, but managed to dodge that bullet. i invested $2.65 in a bottle of marvel mystery oil, poured it into the holes for the injectors and spent about half an hour with a wrench cycling the crankshaft by hand until i got all of the marvelous mysterious oil out of it. that still wouldn't have been too bad, but instead of doing it this morning whilst it was relatively cool, i had to be a big dummy and do it during the heat of the day.hmmm, also managed to break sweetie's ™ pushmower today too, but my current lawnmower misadventures is another story for another day.

     wow
     
    


i did not realize that it had been that long since i'd posted anything. a lot has happened in the past couple of years, but one of the biggest reasons i've not written anything is because i simply have not had the time. another reason is i forgot my stupid passwords and just didn't want to take the 10 minutes to reset everything. i am going to try to start doing a little more posting, maybe once a week anyway. i think i will concentrate on my "redneck engineering" posts, as they seem to garner the most comments.

     feeding hay
     
    


i put out the last of my rolls saturday. i am hoping that the rain from the weekend and the warm weather this week will make the grass green up a little early this year. i probably have enough square bales left to feed another month, but that's it. i dread hay season this year, haven't had time to fix any of the crap from last year and i have a host of new problems to contend with too. i think i just need to win the lottery and buy some equipment that isn't worn out.now, if i can just figure out those winning numbers...

     it's gonna be monday
     
    


all day long.my f-150 is probably totalled. i was rear-ended by a mack truck on the way into work this morning. my back is a little sore and i have a cut on my head where i busted the back glass with it but other than that i seem to be ok, my poor truck, on the other hand, is in pretty sad shape.i had came through a traffic light near the interstate when a semi came around the cloverleaf with a load of rocks (as in big rocks, as in landscaping boulders), one of which rolled off the truck in front of me as i went forward when the light changed. i stomped brakes to avoid hitting this thing (it bounced when it hit the ground... once. they said it weighed about three thousand pounds) and got hit twice by the truck following me. i didn't realize it at the time, but he knocked me a good thirty-five or forty feet.i am one lucky sob. if i hadn't stopped at the red light a few seconds earlier, i would have either a) been in the path of the falling rock, or b) been going about 40 when i was hit instead of 15-20, in either case i would be in the hospital or the morgue.the truck is afu, bed looks like an accordian, back glass is broken and there is a major oil leak up front. the hitch is bent into an l-shape and the frame rails have a nice bow to them now. both doors are screwed up (i had to pry the driver-side door open to get my crap out of it).as for the mack... i think i scratched the chrome on his bumper.

     a sign of the times
     
    


bowater (or meade or somebody like them) is selling or has sold a large (250 acres) tract of timber a few miles away from me. it is sandwiched between 4 or five poultry farms, one dairy and a couple of beef operations. the folks who own the dairy are right beside this property, which is being sectioned up into 2 and three acre chunks to sell at auction. they put up this sign in hopes of heading off some future problems...i believe that people have a right to buy property and live anywhere they choose, but these days it seems more and more people want to move out to the "country" and then bring the "city" with them. i've seen it happen several times in the last few years. urbanites move out to the "sticks" and immediately start complaining about the noise, the smells, tractors on the roads and cows in their flowerbeds (the last in a little tongue in cheek, but such things have happened around here).i don't know whether their sign will help any, but i hope it does.

     i feel bad, because
     
    


i promised gun porn and i just don't have much worth showing. nothing really caught my eye today in the way of firearms, other than this dragoon...which i found interesting simply because it was converted to cartridge. to me that's an awful big weapon to carry on your hip, even though i have used dragoons as belt guns in my foolish youth. i am now firmly of the opinion that dragoons and walkers belong in pommel holsters on the front of your saddle, not your belt.and here we have the ever popular lemat. i will get around to getting myself a repop one of these days, just to plink with.i have more pictures, but they're pretty crappy and not all of them are firearms, i also took pictures of some saddles, a nice looking pair of mexican spurs and a rev war era dragoon helmet.this is all for now, if i do a little photoshop work on the other pictures, i may put some of them up later this week.

got enough on the ground that it put out tony's brushfire.the horses were walking around saying "whats with all this white sh$t? i can't find any grass... ooooh noooooo i'm going to starve!"in othe news, i can't view this page. dunno if it's a blogger thing or a safari thing. i get an error code "bx-vjhbsj" when i try to pull it up. if anyone is seeing this, send me an email.hmm, this is weird. i can view the page now.and now i can't... most be something wrong with blogger.

     ok, this
     
    


is actually the view from my window.not a great picture, but considering it was cloudy today and i was actually shooting through inch thick glass, it ain't bad.the relic show is this weekend. they are a couple of weeks early this year, not sure why. i hope to have some good gun porn to post this weekend.in other news, i have some dr tales, but they're going to have to wait just a leetle while.i've been tied up helping my neighbor burn a humungous brushpile. we've been running the crap out of the case. hells bells, my neighbors have got more use out of it that i have so far. i need to bring it home and do some work over on the back side this winter whilst i can kinda see what i'm doing. we keep kicking around the idea of rebuilding the motor on the cat before it has trees growing up through it, but to be honest, i don't have the freaking time. if scrap metal stays high i may junk the damn thing.

sort of...this is a frontal view. i'm actually over to the right on the second floor where i can look out over uncle joe's bald head all day.this is only known statue that was ever done of gen'l johnston (somehow i'm willing to bet it's one more than braxton bragg has tho'...).roadside georgia has a nice little article about gen'l johnston and his bronze likeness here.
