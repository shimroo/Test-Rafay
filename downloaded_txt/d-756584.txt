    on the face of things, we seem to be merely talking about text-based files, 
    containing only the letters of the english alphabet (and the occasional
    punctuation mark).
   
    

    on deeper inspection, of course, this isn't quite the case. what this site
    offers is a glimpse into the history of writers and artists bound by the
    128 characters that the american standard code for information interchange
    (ascii) allowed them. the focus is on mid-1980's textfiles and the world
    as it was then, but even these files are sometime retooled 1960s and 1970s
    works, and offshoots of this culture exist to this day.
