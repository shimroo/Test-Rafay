our business was established on a foundation of construction layout and site development procedures. few ﬁrms have the patience and understanding of how to balance efficiency with accuracy. we understand that using rtk-gps to set a building grid will likely result in costly mis-closures but that establishing a storm basin does not require first order control. we are of the opinion that bringing us onto your site to provide survey layout should be money well spent. when our crews are on-site, they strive to be efficient and task oriented.monitoring and controlin conjunction with establishing high and mid level precision location of site improvements, we are also armed with several state-of-the-art instruments to monitor movement, both vertical and horizontal during and after completion. these include 3dhd laser scanner, robotic total station with remote measuring capability, electronic 3-wire level, and static gps for high-precision network control. providing a base-line and benchmarks for on-site control, usable by other contractors can usually be done on a tight budget.

just as it sounds, this is the process of adjusting the boundary between two or more properties or lots and which cannot result in the creation of additional lots.each jurisdiction handles this process differently, therefore costs can vary substantially. we always recommend consulting with an attorney whenever there is a lender involved, or property is going to be conveyed to another party or entity. when in its simplest form, we can handle and direct you to the proper forms and formats. again, it is important to remember that most cities and counties have applications and specific requirements which must be addressed before they can be accepted or officially recognized. be prepared to spend some time and money addressing these bureaucratic conditions.boundary line agreementsimilar to an adjustment, but typically this involves properties under different ownership and often this is a reference to the quasi-legal process of averting a lawsuit or other civil disagreements.

state law defines “aquatic lands” as all tidelands, shorelands, harbor areas, and the beds of navigable waters. issues regarding everything from ownership boundaries and aquaculture leases to shoreline development often require the services of a professional surveyor.tideland leaseproposals for the use of state-owned aquatic lands, with a few exceptions, require prior authorization from the washington state department of natural resources (dnr). one of the requirements of authorization is a survey of the leased lands delineating any water dependent physical features as well as the extent of the lease.bathymetric soundingsoften times in the process of completing a survey of aquatic lands it is necessary to know the shape or contour of the submerged lands. this is most easily obtained through the use of equipment speciﬁcity designed for this purpose. sounding equipment combined with gps signals gives us a complete picture of the site and how it can be surveyed or developed.buoy applications/locationthe dnr application for the installation of a buoy requires a vicinity map, mark ed with the position of the buoy or boat lift, acquired either by a differential corrected global positioning system (gps) measurement or by conventional surveying methods. a licensed surveyor must provide this information, or you must document it as follows:a. list the anchor position coordinate, with a state plane grid coordinate or a latitude and longitude.b. detail the survey method used to mark the position of the buoy or boat lift.tideland/land surveytideland owners are often concerned about what it is that they actually own since in most cases they are described simply as “tidelands abutting”. there can be questions as to the extent of the tidelands side to side (laterally) as well as in extent, that is, how far out. these issues are complex and not easily delineated. the rules for resolving these issues are likewise complex and can involve every tool at a surveyors disposal.
