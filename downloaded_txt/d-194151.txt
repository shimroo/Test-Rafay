we are tulalip



we are the tulalip (pronounced tuh’-lay-lup) tribes, direct descendants of and the successors in interest to the snohomish, snoqualmie, skykomish, and other allied bands signatory to the 1855 treaty of point elliott. we agreed to cede title to our ancestral lands as signatories, which expanded to the top of the cascade mountains, north to vancouver island, and south to oregon. in return, the treaty reserved the tulalip indian reservation as our permanent homeland over which we have retained inherent sovereign jurisdiction.
our status as a sovereign government maintains our right to self-govern as a “nation within a nation.” including the inherent right as a government to raise revenue for our community. 92% of our services are funded from tribal hard dollars. these services included tribal member general welfare, family and senior housing, education, health, dental, and mental health services. it also includes law enforcement, fire protection, infrastructure improvements, and economic growth. our tribal population is over 5,100 and growing, with 2,700 members residing on the 22,000 acres tulalip indian reservation. we are located north of everett and the snohomish river and west of marysville, washington.
for more information, please explore our website and read the tulalip visitors guide.
