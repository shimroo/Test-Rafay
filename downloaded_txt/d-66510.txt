enlighten 



welcome to enlighten, a newsletter dedicated to helping you learn more about our sisters, mission, and the unique charism of the daughters of st. paul. since our media mission is far-reaching and expanding, we felt that it was important to shine a light on the “sisters behind the mission” and  capture many of the good things happening in our community.

over 100 promised pauline cooperators collaborate closely with the daughters of st. paul in the u.s. and canada, advancing the mission of evangelization through social communication. 








“i can’t even imagine living out the work that i do without the pauline family. with the pauline family, i have co-workers, friends, and family that remind of the reason why i do what i do, help me to grow, and stay the course.”  






 





christin jezak 



burbank, ca 










“i never dreamed i would actually participate in evangelization myself, but when you love the divine master as much as the daughters helped me to love him, you cannot help but share that love with others!” 






 





jeff mathews 



st. louis, mo 










“a few words that i would say to those thinking about joining a lay association…don’t be afraid! if you feel called to be part of a religious spiritual family, pray and discern. if you still feel a calling, try it.”
