sandland adventures invites you to join us for a day of fun at the oregon dunes. view an impressive natural wonder of endless shifting sand, unique tree islands, various wildlife and the spectacular siuslaw river.  choose an exhilarating dune ride on our sandrails or a more relaxing tour on our giant dune buggies.  our professional drivers will show you a great time while you travel across miles of dunes.  our one hour dune tour also includes traveling down our pacific ocean beach.  large or small groups can be accommodated on either tour.  after your dune ride, you can have fun bumping and splashing on our bumper boats, race on our grand prix style go-kart track, play our miniature golf course or take a ride on the cloverline railroad. we are located less than 1 mile south of florence on the central oregon coast. look for our sign on the west side of hwy 101.
