fic: aut vincere aut mori [swan queen] 1/?
[18 feb 2013|10:19pm]



title: aut vincere aut moriauthor: lysachanfandom: once upon a timeparing: swan queen (emma/regina)word count: 4,692rating: r (for future chapters)summary: au fic set in ancient rome. regina, a vestal priestess, crosses paths with a mysterious gladiator. suddenly, her life is not quite the same. historical!swan queen.a/n: a swan queen au fic set in ancient rome. i mean, what? i have no idea where this came from. well, emma as a gladiator, that's what sparkled this whole thing. while i want to be as historically accurate as possible, i obviously need to take some liberties in order to get our heroines together. for the history buffs out there, the story kicks off in the year 80ad and goes on from there.a big thank you to kayryn for the fanart (it is gorgeous and omg, so hot) and mrswoman for the wonderful beta.link: ff.net

title: a modern day fairytaleauthor: lysachanparing: emma/reginafandom: once upon a timespoilers: seasons 1 will be thoroughly spoiled.a/n: this needed to be written. not only because i'm utterly smitten with swan queen at the moment, but also because all the hate is getting ridiculous. an essay on why swan queen absolutely makes sense. once again, many thanks to darandkerry for beta and kayryn for the banner.( a modern day fairytale - a swan queen ship manifestocollapse )

[22 aug 2009|03:14pm]



title: boringvidder: lysachanfandom: criminal mindsparing: emily/jjspoilers: clips from all four seasons.notes: humour. pure entertainment. not to be taken seriously. this video just sort of happened, i can't really explain it. and of all the songs, this one inspired an emily/jj video; i know, there's something wrong with my head. but what i learned from this project is that jj looks annoyed a lot. best viewed in 16:9 (change settings if viewed with vlc).download/watch: megaupload (47.0mb / .wmv) or youtube. embedded version under the cut.( youtube embedded - boring [emily/jj]collapse )

title: suddenly i seevidder: lysachanfandom: women's murder clubparing: lindsay/cindynotes: although a wonderful gen video for this song was just posted, the damn song simply wouldn't leave me alone. so, i decided to make my video a shippy one, since the number of lindsay/cindy vids out there is surprisingly small. spoilers to the first nine episodes of season 1.download/watch: megaupload (37,1mb / .wmv) or youtube. embedded version under the cut.( youtube embedded - suddenly i see [lindsay/cindy]collapse )

title: all for believingvidder: lysachanfandom: criminal mindsparing: emily/jjnotes: wow. i've wanted to vid emily & jj ever since "revelations" aired, so i can't believe i actually did this. the end result is not exactly what i wanted it to be (i got stuck in slo-mo *sigh*), but i suppose it'll do for now. this is a sort of a companion piece to fewthistle's fic titled, surprisingly enough, all for believing.download/watch: megaupload (25,7mb / .wmv) or youtube. embedded version under the cut.( youtube embedded - all for believing [emily/jj]collapse )

[21 oct 2007|10:18pm]



title: profiler profiledauthor: lysachanfandom: criminal mindsparing: emily/jjword count: 1,377rating: pga/n: written for passion_perfect's "24 hour challenge", using the 'garcia plays matchmaker' prompt. i'd had this idea in my head for a while now, and the challenge offered me a brilliant excuse to write it down. also, i think the title of this fic was used as an episode title last season as well, so sorry for being unoriginal. femslash.( profiler profiledcollapse )
