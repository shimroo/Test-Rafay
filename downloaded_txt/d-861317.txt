hello 2020, it’s me.

i haven’t posted an entry here for a long time. i’ve found that i’ve often resorted to typing textwalls and blogs on facebook, and it’s getting a bit wordy/annoying for people’s feeds. so it may be best to go back to blogging and write about my life and experiences here. so what’s new? since i left my retail management position in 2018, i’ve been going along a path of discovering neurodiversity. it’s been a rough, but very necessary road to travel. imagine living your entire life and judging yourself by a manual for an alien race. you end up wondering why you’re not able to meet the expectations of others.…

i visited my old store today. i mostly did it because one of the other assistant managers was opening and another person kept asking me to come and visit. so i did. i can say with full confidence that i don’t miss that life. sometimes i really miss the people and the socializing. i wasn’t there for friends though. i was there to run a business. i suppose now that i work from home, i don’t see as many people. that said, when i do see people, it’s usually on my own terms and i can usually leave when i want to so that i don’t end up being emotionally…

today would’ve been my mom’s 75th birthday. sometimes she does come up in my thoughts. i try not to dwell in that head space too so much. maybe she would’ve been proud of me for where i am in life right now. granted, i’m not ultimately where i’d like to be. i am in a much better place, in part, because i left that environment nine years ago. things were better, by far, when we were miles apart. i should feel something. in reality, i feel nothing. it’s probably better that way.

so it’s been a really long time. i used to blog almost daily. i haven’t blogged in years. i tried for a little while in 2010 on valkyrie.nu. i also tried to run a j-fashion blog for some time but never had much success with it. for almost 8 years, my life was pretty much engulfed by my job. i’m a bit freer now to keep up with a blog. i’m also travelling more and doing interesting things that might prove to be blogworthy. december-rain.org used to be my personal website and blog. i figured that most of my hobby-related websites are located on quicksilver and mintiness, i’d turn this…
