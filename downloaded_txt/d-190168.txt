	 what's another word for...
	 
    


i took my dog for a walk today. i asked out loud if she was going to make a tinkee-doodle. i think i was asking if she was going to piss and/or poop. no answer -- although she did stop to pee a little while later. just a tinkee. no doodle. speaking of sniglets and odd nomenclature: steelers fan? can't say i've heard that one before but then i don't really follow football - but i might have to start... and if pittsburgh = perineum then what is it between? huh? wha? um... how bout them eagles? [and i sit back to watch the bizarre websearches come in...]this is why i blog anonymously.

re: the recent passing of james brown...i've fallen and i can't get up! instead of the scene i am staying on the floor - how is this like a machine for sex? zut alors!i couldn't get through even half of this french-canadian*(?) person's rendition of 'sex machine' before i started having odd thoughts like a mash-up (gash up?) with this.i'm weird. random.previous james brown related post here and here - i was on  japan kick that time.* yes, i know. french film has nothing in common with french-speaking canada except for the french speaking part sort of. if i see any french-canadian films about a nutty piano teacher i'll update the post.
