2025 tours are here. 















dear fellow travelers—we are delighted to launch our tour schedule for 2025.  we start off the year with one of our best eastern european packages, the european jewels tour to prague, krakow and budapest.  we continue the year with a visit to one of the less explored places in italy, puglia and basilicata, followed by a trip to the southwest parks of the usa in may.  for the summer, we are offering one our most enduring arawjotours classics, the wonders of the aegean to athens, crete and santorini.  july brings us to one of my favorite destinations in the works, norway, on our special fjords of norway trip.  the autumn of 2025 is highlighted by two of our most popular classics, spectacular spain and paris, provence and the french riviera.  this lineup represents an array of destinations that are tried and true and have fittingly earned a place on our 2025 calendar.  during the course of the next several months, we may even offer another one of our “one city wonders” tours over nye.  we will of course keep the website updated should that tour be added.  arawjotours will celebrate 28 years of business in 2025.  we are proud to have served all of you for so many years and are grateful for your loyalty and support.  although we are offering fewer tours than in the past, we are committed to providing the best experiences possible on the trips that appear on our website.  cheers,kevin arawjo2025 tours
