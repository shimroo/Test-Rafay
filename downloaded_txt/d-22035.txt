november 1, 2010 -- invitation to participate in snail-mail nengajyou new year's haiku card exchange


several years ago, pardee gunter introduced to the shiki bbs list the
concept of a new year's (snail mail) haiku card exchange, and those
who participated found it a very rewarding experience.  in 2006,
roberta beary suggested we renew that opportunity. a number of folks
signed up to participate, and it was great fun. even more signed up to
participate each year since.

this year jennie townsend will collect the snail mail addresses and provide a list to
all participants. please note: because it can easily cost $100 or more
just in postage to send cards to all participants, she may create
smaller lists of 15-20 or so for those who cannot afford to send cards
to the whole list, but the whole list will be made available to anyone
who requests it.




here's some background:  the tradition in japan around the new year is
to send a new year's greeting card called a nengajyou (or nengajo) to
friends, family, and acquaintances. the post office in japan is
prepared for this and actually saves these cards to ensure delivery on
january 1. many design their own cards with winter scenes or stamps.
the design typically includes the jyunishi (zodiac sign). 2011 is the
year of the rabbit. somewhere on the card appear the words akemashite
omedetou gozaimasu (happy new year).


for those who are interested in participating in this snail mail
exchange, please send jennie -- offlist please at townsend56ster@gmail.com
-- your snail mail address no later than december 1. she will compile
an address list of all participants and send it to everyone who signs
up (that list will be sent no later than december 3).



when you get your list of participants' snail mail addresses, design a
nengajyou card along the lines suggested above  and include your
original haiku with a new year's theme.  then snail-mail one card to
each person on the list so that the card will arrive by january 1. the
card can be as simple as your haiku and a message on a postcard
(handmade or purchased), or a more elaborate (handcrafted or
purchased) card with your new year's haiku within an envelope.



please put nengajyou in the subject line of your e-mail when you
send your address. and please indicate whether you want to receive
one of the small lists or the whole one.



again, please send your address offlist to:  townsend56ster@gmail.com
