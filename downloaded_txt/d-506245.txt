branch floridians cyber-compound


















jesus said, i
have cast fire upon the world,
and am guarding it until it is ablaze.


gospel of thomas  10:1





    
 

the branch floridians
 are 
an intellectual collective who champion lateral thinking and bad
taste.  we are modern messengers of that most  dangerous of ancient heresies,
think for
yourself! and are the resistance movement in the war for your
brain.  branch floridians are equally dedicated to finding out
whats really
going on, because you need correct information to correctly think for
yourself. 
if  you dont like to think for yourself,
it is strongly suggested you go elsewhere.

disclaimer
:
to appreciate this site and its
underlying premise requires a sarcastic and sardonic sense of humor.  by proceeding, you
agree that you are
 not easily offended by unconventional concepts (factual or fictitious.)  you also
wont hold this site responsible for any mental trauma or resultant
consequences of  thinking for
yourself.  some people are sheep and are not comfortable with independent thinking or actually 
knowing whats really going on.  if so, this site is not for you. 
we just unlock your brain, folks; if you misuse it after that, well, thats your
own lode.

this site is
optimally enabled for (and best viewed through)  pineal chip implants.  if you interface through
non-bioborg meanssuch as a brain police web browseryou should first make a burnt offering to the

wysiwyg   demon before venturing on.  the html has been
booby-trapped to weed out trolls, spam-spiders, and clueless noobies.  also, at times different text may appear, depending if your browser blocks or
supports fnords.  you have been warned.
if you  are using a browser, we have notices the following
patterns when viewing these pages:

oh, so
     youre the one still using it...

sorry for the inconvenience, but then again its
 your fault for not being linked to the chain.
of course, if you do have 
a pineal chip implant, you may proceed directly to the inner circle by thought-clicking
