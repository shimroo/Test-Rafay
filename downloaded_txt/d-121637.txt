welcome to the funny name server!




admit it. as you were looking up a number in the phone book, a funny listing caught your eye. you chuckled at the poor guy whose name is also a curse word. then you thought, "if i had nothing better to do, what other funny names could i find in the phone book?"
that's where the funny name server comes in. we've done all the work for you already! our team of researchers has spent literally hundreds of hours looking up thousands of funny, interesting, strange, and offensive names in phone books from all over the new york tri-state area.

can you find a name in your phone book that's funnier than these? send it to us! see this page for details.
