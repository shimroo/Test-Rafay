customer service
 march 11, 2020
“i contacted potter firearms regarding a replacement printed circuit board (pcb) for the electronic trigger of my morini air pistol. rather than immediately jumping at an opportunity to sell me this expensive part (they had it in stock ready to be sold), they told me what to do in an attempt to fix my broken pcb. i followed the instructions, fixed the trigger and saved myself several hundred dollars. potter firearms could have made a nice sale, but instead they chose to provide their customer with free advice, thus losing the sale. this is extremely rare in today’s world. whilst potter firearms have not earned my business on this occasion, they will earn my business and the business of my friends in the future. what a great company!!!

support
 october 19, 2018
big thank you to potter firearms for their recent support, very much appreciated. i couldn’t have asked for better after sales service and support. good after sales service is something that is lacking in the australian retail environment, with warranty claims being nothing but a battle with retailers. not the case with potter firearms, nothing short of outstanding service, an exemplar the retail industry should be emulating.
well done potter firearms.
