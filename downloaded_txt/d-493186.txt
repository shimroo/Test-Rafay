a place to discover...what is christian zionism?christian zionism merges theology and politics. it teaches that the secular state of israel is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy. christian zionism believes that this fulfillment of biblical prophecy began when european jews started moving to palestine in the 1800s, and continued as israel became a nation in 1948. christian zionists believe that modern israel is a continuation of biblical israel and therefore should enjoy special privileges. they declare that it is the responsibility of christians to support the state of israel and its policies.an invitation for youwe invite you to explore the basis for christian zionism and to find answers to some perplexing questions. for example, is contemporary israel the fulfillment of biblical prophecy? are the jewish people god’s chosen people today? has god promised the land of palestine exclusively to the jewish people as an everlasting inheritance? how should christians view the palestinians and especially the palestinian church?we welcome you to join us in pondering these crucial issues...
