volunteer with the international folk art market”the market has opened my eyes to what creativity exists beyond our borders throughout the world and how important it is to continue to support these incredible artisans so their way of life, their traditions, and their regional crafts can continue to flourish. it’s a real joy to see what they are creating and how fine and detailed the work can often be. the variety of work done in specific regions of the world using local materials is astonishing and to have the opportunity to see such an amazing array of art brought together at a world bazaar in one place is really something epic.”- ifam 2022 volunteer
