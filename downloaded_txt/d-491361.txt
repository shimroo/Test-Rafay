cute friendship quotes





a question very often asked is “what is spirituality” ? what are its benefits? why should i attempt to be spiritual? this is quite a lengthy discussion in itself but today i want to shed some light on this very important word called “spirituality” which has been very loosely used over the past decade or so…. the ability to clearly express each of your thought into words, actions or feelings such that every being who feels the need for a similar thought is drawn towards you in such a manner that from that moment on he/she can clearly read your thoughts and be convinced about your integrity as if the same thought first occurred in his/her own mind. this happens because the barrier between the intellect and heart no longer exists in his/her mind. your words and actions have done the seemingly impossible task of cutting through the layers of intelligence of the opposite person. he/she has developed this uncanny ability to now watch your thoughts as clearly as they can see your body…. when this happens you can be sure that you are building your spirit and you are on your way to ultimate glory….. spirituality is nothing but merging of the subtle with the gross. the highest thoughts in you have to perfectly align with your lowest actions and most simplest of words in you… this is what is called spirituality in earth life…………and the greatest benefit of spirituality is it has the power to replace doubt with trust…. if you notice carefully the no 1 factor, which is responsible for the slow growth of any individual, is ‘doubt’. we doubt our own abilities, our own thoughts our own actions. in doing so we also doubt the thoughts and actions of every other person whom we come in contact with… and so our individual progress and the progress as a group becomes sluggish…. the only thing, which can replace doubt, is trust….and the question then arises how do we build trust? and before we attempt to answer the question as to “how do we build trust, we have to define doubt… if i am interacting with someone i am able to see his/her body language but i cannot read his/her thoughts. this is what creates doubt in me… i cannot read his/her thoughts as clearly as i am able to see his/her body actions and so i attempt to stay away from most of the people because i am not clear of his/her intentions…. and this is where spirituality becomes so very important…. if you build your spirit with the intention of making your thoughts as transparent as your actions and words you create an energy field within the universe where all those beings who feel the need for a similar thought are drawn towards you without any effort on your part…… they are able to read your thoughts as clearly as they are able to see your body…. there is total trust between the other person and you and in this situation both of you benefit because there is really nothing to hold you back…. and the best part of this whole thing is the person who came in contact with you has now experienced in first hand the power of spirituality and he/she seeks to carry and spread this marvelous power to every other being they come in contact with.. and the whole universe is benefited…. there is no other power which can bring about rapid changes within you and that of the world other than spirituality….. it is so powerful and we will discuss a lot of these things inside the very exclusive membership area as we move on….. as of now would love to hear back from you….. lecturer, entrepreneur and fortune 500 business consultant, vish writer is the author of the amazon no 1 bestseller, "the joy of becoming god". visit him at spiritual simplicitythe real secret

"john, your 
          site has the calm and quiet of still forest glades, of ancient holy 
          places. this essence, this gentle peace, is the spirit you have 
          somehow embodied here. you have taken what appears at first just 
          another house of page-views and crafted it into a chapel of electrons, 
          a refuge where business and other travelers can pause and recharge 
          spiritually. today's fast-forward world offers so few havens for 
          re-centering ourselves or for re-grounding our spiritual energies. 
          thanks so much for making this site, john. its quiet impact will 
          soothe every soul who pauses here." charles burke - author of 
          "inside the minds of winners" www.sizzlingedge.com 
            
  









""what a 
          wonderful combination of wisdom and kindness. not surprising, since 
          those two traits are exactly what you embody in everything you do. 
          there's an old jewish saying, 'words that come from the heart, enter 
          the heart.' i believe that those fortunate enough to make the decision 
          to become a member will sense this in all of the information you 
          present. thank you john; for being a friend, a mentor, and just a 
          great example of all that is right in our world." 
            bob burg, author"endless referrals", "winning without 
          intimidation" and "the success formula"

""i call john harricharan the mystic mba, and i think of him as my shamanic business advisor. there are many people out there offering advice; john harricharan is the only intuitive consultant among them. over the years, he has introduced me to the ideas of a number of spiritual thinkers, and his counsel has already made a lasting difference in my life and my business. johnõs membership web site, enterprising spirit, is loaded with the same kind of practical insight and timeless knowledge learned the hard way. if you joined simply to gain access to his inspiring e-books, articles, and wisdom, it would surely be worth it. but on top of that, many of his vast network of friends and associates have contributed to the largesse. spiritual simplicity is truly a find--the spiritual, right-brained, non-linear side of business, told beautifully." 
            paul lemberg, author "earn twice as much with half the stress", "faster than the speed of change". director, stratamax research"


  










""i've tried a bunch of programs, but spiritual-simplicity.com is where i go for my prescribed spoonful of motivational insights, inspiring information and valuable resources. i've known john for many years and have seen him create his bestselling books and courses. he outdid himself this time by putting together a membership site that supports people who are trying to be their best. if you want to succeed in business or if you want help with your personal problems, join spiritual-simplicity.com the foster hibbard sound files and the "secrets to guaranteed goal achievement" included in the bonuses are priceless." 
            lillian cosby, author"the world's foremost intuitive consultant "



  










""an icon in his own time, john harricharan carries the wisdom of the ages, along with an unparalleled warmth of spirit. he is one of the master teachers of the world." 
            jl scott, ph.d  director of icop
            


  










""i want to share with you a little insight on john harricharan. john has not only been a good friend for many years  but a real influence on the way i do business  and also the way i have learnt to improve my life and to really  enjoy  what i am doing. one of the pleasures of knowing john and his teachings is that he comes to you … not only as a guide on the side as i like to say… not as a guru telling you the truth… but he is really talking about you and how you can apply things to your own  life and really look right in front of you … like right now there is a beautiful world looking at you but are you looking at it and seeing the beauty through your own eyes…  john thank you for being my friend, my inspiration and also really thank you for being the only person whom i invite to my business conferences to my private members  because i want that they meet people with great substance and also go away with much much more for their heart as well as their wallet… john thanks so much….."
