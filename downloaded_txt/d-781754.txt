this is a picture of our school in mathare, kenya (as of jan 2023).  mathare is a very impoverished area outside nairobi.  in 2022, we began an ambitious project to expand our facility.  what began as a desire to add a few classrooms grew to a doubling of our space!  the top floor is a large play area and the roof is a water collection system for the entire school.  this was so exciting to witness!


this is our school as of march 2022.  the tents on the right were being used as classrooms.  we wanted to replace the tents with permanent classrooms.

this video shows the beginning of our school.  the construction of our own facility began in 2015 and took four years to complete.  thank you so very much for supporting this effort!!

 
please consider helping us with the daily needs of the school through a one-time donation or regular monthly donations.  you can make either type of donation from our support page – click here .

“this is what the lord says:  ‘let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows me, that i am the lord, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in this i delight.”  (jeremiah 9:23-24)
strive to know him better and to make him known to all the world!
