          hanna hummingbird haven:



the 2024 "hanna 
      hummingbird haven" year is continuing at the cabin of dena & jim reid in hanna, utah,. the 
          rufus hummingbirds are in great numbers now (15th of  july) and 
      usually start leaving after the 1st week of august, so they are still here 
      for a while. there are calliope hummingbirds coming as well.  dena was in the hospital for 2 months but is back at 
      the cabin.  jim is taking good care of the hummingbirds and the 
      doctors are taking good care of dena. [blog]  we're glad she is back home 
      she's still on oxygen but is doing well.   .  visitors are 
      welcome! 
       
      (note: ."i need to remind people i do not have public restrooms available 
      and that they need to visit the hanna store at mile post 37 for those 
      necessities.i do not let anyone inside our home. and the river at the 
      moment is fast , strong, and cold dangerous") 
      
           
      (here are two slow-motion videos by paul hunsaker: 
      video 1, 
      
      video 2)



   
          albino and leucistic birds:




our 
          albino & leusistic bird photo 
          collection. keeps on growing!  if you get a new photo, 
          please send it in.  
      we now have at least 26 species in our "albino" collection. 
          here's a  list of our species














    
      update of pages showing 
      recently-hatched birds:
a feature article from ten years 
      ago, highlighted photos in our photo gallery of 35 species of 
      recently hatched birds --  the cutest birds 
      you'll ever see! the number is now up to 
      105 species (in 2022).  here are 
          links to the updated pages.
   









            
ebird links for our birding places:
there are description and directions to over 500 
      birding places on the utah birds website.  we now have links to the ebird sightings for almost all of them, both in the "index 
      of birding sites" and on  the individual pages describing the 
      places to bird found on the county pages.  
      through each ebird link you can also find other ebird information for 
      nearby places, by using the "hotspot map,"  so once you've found one 
      place you can easily find information for other places in the area.



  
          types of bird nests:



many excellent photos of bird nests, birds nesting 
      and young birds fresh from their nests, have been sent in by
      utah photographers.  
      a new article on "bird nests and 
      nesting schemes" with some of these photos and information about 
      eleven different types of nests or nesting schemes has been posted on our 
      website.  a big "thank you" to the photographers who have shared 
      their photos with us.



 
          feature article:



here's a series of pictures taken by ernest harlow 
      of a barn swallow nest in 
      brigham city.  this shows everything from eggs, to featherless 
      hatchings, to downy chicks, to feathered chick ready to go, to the empty 
      feather-lined nest.

      to feature articles)
   



  
          utah winter gull identification:



at the october meeting of the utah county birders,
      dennis shirley gave a presentation on identifying 
      "utah winter gulls," 
      which has now been adapted and expanded for the 
utah birds 
      website.  it's become a "work in process" and we'd like you to take a 
      look and give us some feedback on how we can improve it -- and you may be 
      able to learn to better identify the
      winter gulls in utah at the 
      same time.



            
bird humor:


here 
          are some links to the "bird 
          humor" section of our feature pages:
  - "change is in the air"  (a stealthy 
          starling is up to something).
  - "mom's favorite"  (how 
          you can tell you're not).
  - "snack-lifting "  
          (a clever little gull is hooked on junk food).
  - "heavenly smiley faces"  
          (smiley faces are use in emails and...)
