subject:rock show recap
security:public

though i was camera-less, i have seen some amazing shows recently including:pearl jam/sonic youth at the fonda: it was a fan only show and probably one of pj's best. my personal highlight: "crazy mary," during which eddie vedder damn near chugged an entire bottle of red wine. some celebs in the house, too. i spotted adam sandler standing side-stage, jeremy piven in the crowd and white stripes drummer meg white hanging at the roof-top bar. matt costa at the troubador: i didn't know much about this guy until i went to coachella and literally half the girls i interviewed said he was their fesitval favorite. so i went to check him out and when i got there, was told that my tickets were for the previous night's show. oops... still, i hung around outside and listened in and what i heard i really, really liked. rooney/kelly clarkson at the pnc bank arts center: i love those rooney boys and was psyched when i heard they were opening for kelly clarkson on her us tour. i caught the show in new jersey and got to catch up with the guys and hear some of their new material. it was great to see them back on stage, getting the kiddies all riled up. and kelly brought down the house! her show is spectacular, the best part being when she runs into the crowd for since u been gone. clarkson rocks, there's no doubt about it. the raconteurs at the wiltern: excluding that killer keane show at the fonda, this may be my favorite concert of the year so far. it was the answer to all those nights when i was watching the white stripes wondering, "will i ever be able to see jack white play with a real band?!" and what a band the raconteurs turned out to be. brendan benson... so hot! and even jack, without that scary jacko vibe, seemed super sexy. it's a beauty of a record and one hell of a show. see it if you can.

subject:long time...
security:public

i know it's been a while since i last posted. on a trip to new york a few weeks ago, i lost my camera and have been severely depressed about it ever since. just the thought of someone walking around with all my favorite photos - some of which were never downloaded - totally bums me out. but, i had to get over it and just two days ago, brought myself a brand new casio exilim 6.0-megapixel digital (my camera of choice). ======>> needless to say, it's been a busy few weeks. i've seen some amazing shows, done some interesting interviews, and tried to make the most out of this insufferably hot la summer. i've also been glued to the tv, watching the latest developments in israel, where much of my family resides. nothing i can say about that. it's just all so unfortunate.

subject:my katharine cover is out this week!
security:public

hey everybody, my teen people cover on katharine mcphee is finally out! a lot of late nights went into writing this story so i hope you get a chance to read it. the interview was done about 36 hours after the idol finale, so you can imagine how exhausted kat was at the time. still, she was surprisingly candid about her struggles with weight, hollywood and guys and i must admit that i was really impressed by her poise and general presence. of course, it was difficult to learn about her eating disorder, but katharine seems to be much healthier now and is eager to tell her story so other girls can avoid the same fate. a noble act, indeed. here are some pics from our cover shoot, but the ones in the mag are much cooler so pick up a copy at your local newsstand and let me know what you think. [we ordered a manicurist for kat but found out soon enough that the girl bites her nails like there's no tomorrow!][talk about a multi-tasker! while katharine has her hair done, she also conducts a conference call with print reporters][kat takes a lunch break with teen people's hayley hill (left) and lori majewski (right)][just one of the killer pics photographer brian bowen smith shot for the mag][mcpheever still runs high in la. i saw this shirt on display at hollywood & highland just last week!]for some video footage from our cover shoot, check out teenpeople.com

subject:radiohead rules!
security:public

radiohead played two glorious nights at the greek theatre and there's no doubt la was buzzing. especially around my 'hood of silver lake, which is only a couple miles from the venue. i caught the first show and it was spectacular. the greek has to be my favorite venue (though i still haven't seen a show at the hollywood bowl) and it's perfect for the trippy, sensory overload performance that  radiohead always gives. the after-party was pretty cool, too. i heard that jim carrey and new girlfriend jennie mccarthey were in the audience so i was hoping to see them there, but no such luck. i did, however, see roseanna arquette, giovanni ribisi and scott speedman hanging out. [see, i wasn't kidding! the radiohead love was outta control.]

i ran into the lovely jesse mccartney at shane west's birthday bash on sunday nite. he couldn't help but sing the praises of his girlfriend, katie cassidy, who just nabbed the coveted role of lucy ewing (beating out jessica simpson and kristin cavalleri) in the movie remake of dallas, which happens to be one of my fave shows of all time. yeah, yeah, jesse - you told me so, but way to go katie! here are some more pics from shane and eric podwell's party at skybar.

security:public

it must be years since the last time i saw pete yorn play somewhere in new york, but i was such a huge fan of musicforthemorningafter that when i heard he was heading out on an intimate acoustic tour, i decided to check out the kick-off show in santa barbara. of course, first shows tend to be a little, um, sloppy, and this one was no exception, but pete was spot-on for fan favorites like "life on a chain" and "murray" ("strange condition" was strangely absent) and even a couple of covers including the smiths' "there is a light that never goes out" and the association's "never my love." and i have no doubt that his set will only improve as he treks onward. welcome back, pete. it's nice to see you again...[the view from outside]pete yorn is on the road, playing small venues and record stores, all friggin' summer!06/27/06 -- dallas, tx -- gypsy tea room / ballroom  06/28/06  -- austin, tx -- the parish  06/30/06  -- lawrence, ks -- the bottleneck  07/01/06  --  saint louis, mo -- blueberry hill's duck room  07/02/06  --  madison, wi -- the annex  07/05/06  --  indianapolis, in -- the music mill  07/06/06  --  columbus, oh -- the basement  07/06/06  --  columbus, oh -- the singing dog  07/07/06  --  louisville, ky -- phoenix hill tavern  07/08/06  -- buffalo, ny	-- town ballroom  07/10/06  --  rochester, ny -- water street music hall  07/11/06  --  portland, me -- the asylum  07/12/06  -- cambridge, ma -- newbury comics  07/12/06  -- boston, ma	 -- paradise rock club / lounge  07/13/06  --  towson, md -- record & tape traders  07/13/06  --  baltimore, md -- sonar  07/15/06  -- carrboro, nc -- cat's cradle  07/16/06  -- knoxville, tn -- blue cats  07/17/06  -- nashville, tn -- exit / in  07/18/06  --  atlanta, ga -- smith's olde bar  07/19/06  -- birmingham, al -- the nick  07/21/06  -- council bluffs, ia	 -- whiskey roadhouse @ harrah's  07/22/06  --  minneapolis, mn -- electric fetus  07/22/06  -- minneapolis, mn	 -- varsity theatre  07/24/06  --  denver, co -- walnut room  07/25/06  -- boulder, co -- fox theatre  07/26/06  --  salt lake city, ut -- club sound  07/28/06  -- seattle, wa	 -- crocodile cafe  07/31/06  --  san francisco, ca -- great american music hall  08/01/06  -- encinitas, ca -- lou's records  08/01/06  -- san diego, ca -- the casbah  08/02/06  -- scottsdale, az -- martini ranch  08/08/06  -- alexandria, va -- ollson's books and music store  08/08/06  --  alexandria, va -- the birchmere  08/09/06  -- richmond, va -- alley katz  08/11/06  -- philadelphia, pa -- north star  08/12/06  -- asbury park, nj -- stone pony

subject:green day win the ascap creative voice award
security:public

some pictures from the ascap pop awards, which honored green day, ciara, switchfoot and maroon 5, among others. since the awards are all about songs and songwriting, i thought i'd ask the green day guys what lyric changed their lives and i got some interesting answers. check 'em out:me: what was a lyric that changed your life?billie joe armstrong: "'i’d rather see you dead little girl, than see you with another man.' it's from an elvis presley song called 'baby, let's play house' and it was on sun sessions. i was probably about 10 when i heard that."tré cool: " 'if we can walk together, why can’t we rock together.' it's by 7 seconds."mike dirnt: "billy joel's 'still rock and roll to me.' i heard it on the bus going to ymca camp in oakland, california and i just thought that song was the coolest thing in the world. to me, it sounded like what real rock-n-roll should sound like."tré cool: "see, he almost got to be in a band with billy joel but he had to settle for billie joe!"[that's ciara] [on top of signing it, billie joe fully christened this guitar.][green day received the creative voice award. thank g-d somebody's talking...][that's jonathan foreman from switchfoot, talking to billboard's melinda newman.][the papa roach guys, who performed "scars" later in the show. is it my imagination or does singer jacoby shaddix look like he lost a lot of weight?][that's my friend jackey with her adorable boyfriend]

subject:keane for a day
security:public

o.m.g. i'm still riding high from last night's keane show at the henry fonda. those heart-melting melodies and soul-searching lyrics, plus a packed house chanting along to every word - it was quite the la welcome. the first time i saw these guys was back in new york city, before their debut, hopes and fears, was released in the us. needless to say, outside of them being a british three-piece who didn't use any guitars, people didn't really know much about the band. and i remember that show being stiff, like the singer, tom chaplin, wasn't entirely comfortable being the "frontman." but here we are maybe three years later and the guys have come a long way. richard and tim handled their multi-instrumental duties like seasoned pros and tom, believe it or not, had this jim morrison thing going on last night, with the low-hung sexy belt and seductive gaze. no wonder a good 100 fans were lined up for three hours after the show waiting for autographs. these guys have got it going on and people are taking notice. so this brings back another memory (and, yes, i'm a music geek so i'm sure you see where this is going), when a colleague of mine at rolling stone poo-pooed my love of keane. "why not just listen to the snowpatrol record?" she said with a sting. and, don't get me wrong, i love snowpatrol, coldplay and all those piano bands, but there is something really special about keane and i think it's their sincerity. i don't know, i just worship them. so take a listen to their new album, under the iron sea, if you haven't already. like the last one, it's just plain beautiful. and check out these pics of the guys. [tom signs a stack of posters, cd liner notes and soccer balls - or footballs, as he would say.][that's keyboardist tim rice-oxley and, um, he's hot.][drummer richard hughes ain't too shabby, either.][tom looks noticeably slimmer. he told me that he's not drinking on this tour, could that be why?][actor paul rudd was there! (that's my friend, brenda, with him.) anchorman already made him cool in my book, but being a keane fan makes him so much cooler.] [this was the line of fans waiting outside of the stage entrance at 2:00am! can you believe?!][and, of course, the band obliged every single one.][the next day, keane taped an in-studio performance at kcrw in santa monica] [this was the simultaneous webcast.]

subject:howling on hollywood blvd.
security:public

paid a little visit to my friends over at jimmy kimmel live tonight to catch wolfmother play on the outdoor stage. i missed their show last night at the fonda, which i heard was packed beyond belief, so it was nice to see an intimate five-song version. so does this australian band live up to the hype? "woman" rocks, that's for sure. as for the rest of the songs, i really liked what i heard. they sound like a sloppier, more garage-y led zeppelin. and for a three piece, they make a helluva lot of noise. plus, if i'm not mistaken, the bass player was pulling double duty, manning the keyboards, too. that's impressive! jimmy's guest tonight was jack black, who was also rocking out dewey finn-style from a couch on the side of the stage. speaking of, it was practically a school of rock reunion when sarah silverman (aka amazing comedienne, and jimmy's girlfriend), joined her pal jack on that couch. she was so good in that movie and i can't wait for her comedy central show.  [wolfmother singer, andrew stockdale][jack and jimmy give a standing ovation, while guillermo wanders aimlessly. gotta love guillermo!][these are the guys that make it all happen — music booker, scott igoe (left), and executive producer, jason schrift][leaving the show, jack black signed autographs for waiting fans.]

subject:long live andrew mcmahon!
security:public

don't know if you were a something corporate fan, or if you've even heard of the band, but they were one of my favorites. singer andrew mcmahon sounded like ben folds (another fave), but had more balls and spunk. i adored him before i ever met him. so when andrew formed a new group, jack's mannequin, a little over a year ago, i was one of the first to jump on the bandwagon - literally. but just a few days after a pre-tour hang with andrew at this fabulous party in beverly hills, i received news that he had cancelled his new york shows because he wasn't feeling well. not long after that, we all learned that he had been diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia. cancer?he was only 23 years old?! wtf????i started reading andrew's blog, which he was writing from his hospital bed, and could barely deal. i can't even imagine how he did. fortunately, andrew is strong as a motherf-er and pulled through, with the help of his sister, katie, who faciliated a stem-cell transplant. not surprisingly, andrew started playing again as soon as he could and, on that first show back in december 2005, he looked weak and pale. he rocked it, but wasn't pounding on the piano with the ferocity that he used to have. i was happy to see him, but sad that i couldn't give him a hug because any germs put him at risk for infection. still, he was getting better everyday and, as long as he was alive, countless friends, family members and fans were overjoyed. now it's been a full year since the diagnosis and andrew is back on the road opening for o.a.r. i caught the set at the wiltern theatre on friday and was so psyched to see that he was back to his usual on-stage antics, getting the crowd riled up with every chord. but the best moment came at the end, when andrew belted his true-to-the-original take on tom petty's "american girl" as the closer. hot damn, was it good! so i'm happy to present these photos of a strong, healthy, rejuventated andrew. the first is from the night of the show and the second from a photo shoot we did a few days later for an upcoming issue of teen people. if you look closely, you'll notice that his hair went from brown to black practically overnight. he's a cutie either way, but i think i like the black better. which do you prefer?

i caught a somewhat secret appearance that constantine maroulis made at this cool jazz club in bel air called vibrato. i didn't think i'd know anybody there, but when i walked in, i saw sean lennon on the stage (who i don't know personally) and ryan cabrera, a mutual friend of mine and constantine's, in the crowd with his mom. so we all sat down and waited for constantine to perform two new songs, which i must say, were not what i expected. the music had this old soul, sam cooke kind of vibe, a complete 180 from his last band. and, as usual, he commanded the stage like only constantine can. here's hoping for a record soon.

subject:carrie underwood rocks morongo casino

i went to see carrie underwood perform outside of palm springs at the morongo casino, which houses the brand new key club. it was my second time at the key club (i saw duran duran the week the club opened), and looking at their list of upcoming shows, i have to say that they're getting some really cool bands to play there, including la's infamous 80s hair-metal cover band, metal skool, which has a weekly residency that i highly recommend you check out if you're ever in the area. anyway, carrie was great. i hadn't seen her since the grammy awards back in february and the time she's spent on the road, playing tons of county fairs, by her account, has really helped her performance. she's more confident than she ever seemed on idol, and her voice truly is tremendous. the show was sold out and i saw tons of cowboy-hat wearing locals in the audience. carrie is a country artist, for sure, but she has her inner metal, too. during the hour-long set, she covered two guns 'n roses songs, "patience" and "sweet child o' mine," giving them both a twangy treatment which went over really well with the crowd. but my favorite moment was her hushed version of dolly parton's "jolene." simply spine-chilling, i tell you.

subject:high school musical mania!!
security:public

when the disney channel movie high school musical first aired, there was little fanfare and certainly no red carpet. the under-the-radar flick, about a basketball player and a math geek who, while worlds apart, and drawn to each other through song, was a blip of disney's programming slate. now, mere months later, the premiere for the dvd was sheer pandemonium on hollywood boulevard, with its stars just as taken by the spectacle as the fans themselves! "the fact that we can do this for the dvd, after people have seen the movie a hundred times is crazy!" said monique coleman, who plays taylor in the movie. "there's so many people on this street, i've driven by other premieres before and tonight i'm on the other side. it's a big honor." it was also a really busy day for the cast, who attended the premiere following a separate press junket that morning. then, once they were done with the carpet, they made their way into the famed el capitan theatre for a sing-along screening followed by an after-party at the highlands, where they shot hoops and rubbed shoulders with industry folks and fans, including celebs like lisa rinna and american idol's ace young. [the themed carpet — complete with school desks and lockers — was way cool. nice work, disney!][the main event, mr. zac efron, said he "felt blessed to be chosen" for the role of troy.] [ashley tisdale is all laughs and having a blast on the carpet. the former jersey girl (like me!) said she was also excited about the high school musical sequel. "it's being written and everybody's signed on," she told me. "we all can't wait. it couldn't come any faster."[this adorable baby doll dress was a betsy johnson find, said ashley. "it was the first thing i saw and tried on and i thought it was perfect. and the cast was supposed to wear all red and white because of the wildcats, but..." well, you know how hard it is to coordinate outfits.][vanessa anne hudgens, who plays gabriella, walks the line next to lisa rinna.][two adorable little girls sing songs from the movie to a local news crew. awww....][here's zac being interviewed by teen people stringer, lindzi scharf]i accidentally deleted my photo of cutie lucas gabreel, who was sporting a toned down look. "hair's down, no hat, outfit's kind of mellow, i don't look so girlie," he said to contrast his character, ryan. as for the premiere itself, it was actually lucas's first red carpet. "this is insane," he said. "but i signed up for this, so i gotta roll with the punches."

subject:happy birthday, joe francis!
security:public

who is joe francis? he's the multi-millionaire businessman responsible for the girls gone wild series, which i have never watched, not even a snippet at a frat party, i swear! anyway, the guy's got a lot of money and is also quite the hollywood scenester. so much so that he invited about 2,000 of his closest scenster friends to celebrate his birthday at six flags magic mountain, 30 miles outside of la. now, it's not that easy to drag celebrities outside of their comfort zone, but with promised free concessions, no lines on rides, an open bar and a set by dj am, they came out in droves. jessica alba, lindsay lohan, paris hilton, kelly osbourne, mekhi phifer and kristin cavalleri were just a few of the stars who made the trip, though i didn't see any of them inside because the place was so friggin' big! perhaps they were sampling the park's newest coaster, tatsu, in which you literally dangle in the air while staring straight down. yeah, you couldn't pay me enough money to get on it, but i'm sure paris doesn't have that hang-up. and so i spent most of the evening with fellow scaredy-cat, alexis arquette (of surreal life fame), laughing and people-watching. and, even with no celebs in sight, what an entertaining crowd it was!  [you had to take a tram from the parking lot to the main gate, where hundreds were already lined up][paris gets cozy with her latest boy toy][jessica alba looking stunning, as usual][dirty dancing with tweety?? now that's just not right][alexis makes her red carpet entrance][stephan bender, who plays young clark kent in the new superman movie, arrived with a date by the name of stephanie][there were lots of fun games to play for those of us not into flying through the air at the speed of light][that's alexis with one of my favorite photgraphers, mark, the cobra snake][and speaking of cobra snake, i loved this shot he took of all the discarded stuffed animal prizes. what's the point of keeping those things anyway, right?][six flags' latest mega-coaster, tatsu, which should maybe be called nutsu!][it also graced the official party pass]
