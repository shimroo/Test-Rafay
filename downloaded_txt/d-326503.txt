international living magazine again chooses mexico 









world’s top 4 retirement havens  
mexico
9 years in a row





(usa was #14)



												 
mexico top country to retire in
excellent health care/insurance at very affordable prices.
extremely low property taxes
excellent real estate pricing - especially beach property! 
mexico took first place in 2007, 2008, and has been in the top 4 countries to retire in the world for the past 9 years!!!!
 
international living magazine quotes:
"mexico’s colorful, vibrant culture does rank high with expats who live here…but it is just the cherry—and the icing—on a very rich cake. for expats, mexico is an easy, convenient choice…a largely first-world country, at bargain prices, right on their doorstep. no wonder a million or more expats make mexico their home.
today’s mexico offers modern highways and airports, cable and satellite tv, internet, and other goodies expats enjoy at home. want a big u.s.-style washer and dryer or a monster refrigerator?
no problem in mexico—you’ll even find familiar brands. yet the overall cost of living can be as little as half what you’d pay in the u.s. or canada.
health care, too, is good to excellent. (so good, in fact, that many mexican hospitals do a thriving business in medical tourism.) across the board, health care—including doctor’s visits, hospital stays, lab tests, and devices—costs a quarter to a half of what you’d pay in the u.s. that’s assuming, of course, that you even pay out of pocket. if you hold a valid residence visa, you can sign up for mexico’s national health-care system—which has a top cost of about $300 a year."

 
**************
playa de oro  says:
    baja's beaches 
are the

    miles of white sand, sun, sea, golf and  palm trees
a great investment!

we all promised ourselves that
we would retire on the beach.
let playa de oro help you 
keep that promise.
