professional website tips
this  website tells you all you need to know about   getting your uk business online with your own website. it explains in   layperson's terms all the processes and costs involved in website          development. look for the useful web site design tips in these boxes in the margins of each page. 
 designer's history check 
before committing yourself to a website design   company ensure that it has some history. many of my clients approach me   after being let down by web designers          who have just disappeared. 
these are people who think that getting into web   design is a good idea at the time. they then decide that it is not for   them or they lose interest or get a different job          leaving previous clients high and dry. 
web design tip 
ensure that you offer your website visitors hard copy information where appropriate
on your business website you can provide full printed details   of your business without the usual high          printing and updating cost. within your web pages you can also   offer your site visitors downloadable information about your company,   products and services. 
all you need to do is provide me with copies          of your brochures, catalogues, pamphlets, specification sheets,   documents or lists. i can then build them into your website for all your clients and prospective clients to download at no additional cost to you. this means          that your visitors can retain hard copy details, including full   contact information for your business.
website content development
we can develop the required content for your website by writing the copy for you. contact us for web design advice and advice on content development.
look at the web designer's portfolios
in small business web site design you are able to see previous work before choosing your webs designer. most   professional web designers want to show          you their own web design portfolios.

we apply tried and trusted methods of promoting your products or services with a clean, attractive, "no nonsense" business website development,   which will have the sole aim of encouraging        your prospective clients to do business with you. 
many website   designers have a tendency to show people all the clever stuff they can   create using their various programming skills but in business      website design we must never lose sight of the objective, which is   to sell your product or service. 
too much flash and animation,   for example, is just a distraction that can annoy people causing them   to lose track of the real content of your        site and to click away to those of your rivals. this is fact, not   an opinion. recent surveys have found that the majority of people who   are seeking goods or services on the internet consider flash        intros to be irritating.â

some companies may get their sites built then use another agency   to help them get found but all this can be included in your deal with   toucher web design. contact me for a free ecommerce website quote. (bryan weir, freelance web designer.)
