mafia turncoat anthony arillotta takes witness stand for second day at trial of emilio fusco for murder of al bruno






arillotta, 44, a mafia soldier-turned-informant from springfield, resumed the witness stand wednesday for the second day in a mob murder trial in manhattan. on trial is longmeadow loan shark emilio fusco, a fellow "made man" in the new york-based genovese organized crime family. both arillotta and fusco were indicted for a string of crimes including the 2003 murder of their onetime boss, adolfo "big al" bruno, amid a power play in 2003.

arillotta, however, entered into a plea deal with federal prosecutors shortly after his arrest in 2010 and has testified against his closest confidantes and bosses over two trials. last year, arillotta took the stand against two of his most trusted enforcers, fotios "freddy" and ty geas, of west springfield, plus the former acting boss of the genovese family, arthur "artie" nigro, of bronx, ny.

those three were convicted and are serving life sentences in federal prison. fusco, whose trial was delayed because he fled to his native italy, according to prosecutors, has opted to take his chances. he has denied all charges against him including racketeering, murder and extortion.

sicily's mafia said to pocket a third of all government transfers




rome (dow jones)--the sicilian mafia pockets more than a third of all the money allocated by the central government in rome for public services on the island, according to a study to be presented at the royal economic society's 2012 annual conference.the report by guglielmo barone and gaia narciso found that organized crime effectively undermined economic growth and development by manipulating the assignment of public funds aimed at poor and undeveloped areas on the island.the study found that organized crime took 35% of the funds from contracts awarded by the italian government to local firms to provide public services in sicily--as well as other poorer regions in the country.sicily's crime syndicates create fictitious firms and encourage corrupt public officials to allocate resources to these companies. barone and narciso cite local claims that the modern costra nostra is a "new mafia-related bourgeoisie, made of lawyers, notaries, accountants and entrepreneurs."they argue that similar problems are likely to be found in other poor regions of europe which receive funds from the european commission.

how bertie rose to power with the drumcondra mafia






it's impossible to look at the story of bertie ahern's political career without reference to the small cabal that was by his side throughout. you see, it was never just bertie ahern. it was always bertie ahern and the drumcondra mafia.

the drumcondra mafia was not a political party -- incredibly many of them weren't even members of fianna fail -- but it succeeded in putting its man in the most powerful office in the land.

money is of central importance to their story. the formidable constituency machine it built was the best funded in the history of the state -- helped by an annual dinner that assumed almost mythical status. and money, of course, was central to mr ahern's downfall. it took the best part of two years for it to happen, but the discovery that large sums had flown either through his own bank accounts or those of his associates, and the less than convincing explanations he subsequently gave, led directly to his resignation as taoiseach.

st luke's, the routine two-storey red-brick former doctor's surgery across the road from fagan's pub, was the nerve centre of the drumcondra mafia operation. with the ministerial merc parked outside on the footpath, it became the physical manifestation of mr ahern's power base. for a decade, it was effectively the alternative seat of government. and the building was to feature heavily in the investigation into mr ahern's finances.

stolen ipad led to huge meth bust in san jose




surely, police must have been on the trail of a major theft ring when they arrived thursday at an apartment complex in san jose, only to trip over one of the biggest stashes of methamphetamine ever seized in the united states?not exactly.palo alto police were apparently looking for a single stolen ipad when they arrived thursday at the woods, a sprawling apartment complex on snell road, according to the santa clara county district attorney's office.the cops had tracked the ipad via gps, said assistant district attorney david tomkins.the officers didn't have a search warrant, so they knocked on the door of the apartment and asked the occupants for permission to come in. they consented, tomkins said."they probably thought if they didn't, we'd suspect something," tomkins said. "or they thought, 'i'll let them in -- they probably won't find anything.'"much to their amazement, the officers found 780 pounds of crystal meth scattered around the place, worth about $35 million.district attorney jeff rosen said roughly 100 pounds or a little more of meth are recovered annually in the county, making this seizure "easily at least six years worth," he said."i told my dad about the bust," said rosen, "and he said, 'they have $35 million, and they can't go out and buy an ipad?"

shooting victim had montreal mafia connections






montreal — a 38-year-old man, shot dead in montreal thursday evening near a known mob hangout, had a colourful and extensive history with the mafia.





giuseppe (closure) colapelle entered the montreal mafia's bad books in 2005 — "tarnishing everyone," according to a mob leader's assessment recorded by police — when a serious conflict arose between the rizzuto organization and an organized-crime group based in granby, que., and known for smuggling marijuana.





according to evidence that surfaced during the project colisee mob-surveillance investigation conducted by police during that period, that conflict degenerated to the point where one man was kidnapped and another man's car was set afire in granby before the dispute was resolved.



in court documents, colapelle was revealed to be at the very heart of the conflict.





mafia leaders were, at one point, recorded by police discussing the possibility of having the man they referred to as closure brought to the basement of a cafe in montreal for a beating.



the recordings suggested colapelle was a partner of giuseppe (ponytail) devito for a brief period — but that their relationship soured because of the conflict with the people based in granby.





in october 2004, mafia leader francesco (compare frank) arcadi was recorded discussing the matter inside the cafe consenza.





at one point, arcadi complained that colapelle was "tarnishing everyone" in the mafia because of how he was handling the aftermath of a large-scale marijuana deal that had gone bad.

crossfire between troops and criminals in mexico




mexican armed forces’ confrontation with organized crime and the criminal acts of the latter currently constitute the most terrifying aspect of mexican society.the country’s information services daily reveal heavy blows against these illegal groups, with the capture of many capos and members, plus the seizure of weapons and other resources.successes highlighted by the government include the fact that, since 2009, 22 of the 37 most wanted criminals have been arrested, or have died in confrontations with other gangs or during their capture.however, despite these results on the part of authorities, aggressive drug trafficking gangs continue their criminal activities, compounded by others such as narcotics trading, extortion, kidnapping, person trafficking and theft.this diversification has notably intensified crime in the country, in particular bloody fights for territorial control, with frequent inter-gang killings, also involving other victims.the principal gangs involved in the confrontations, characterized by their high degree of cruelty, are the zetas, the sinaloa cartel, the félix arellanos, the michoacana family, the caballeros templarios, as well as gangs of hired killers linked to them.

police arrest 25 alleged anonymous members, angry hackers retaliate




law enforcement authorities arrested 25 individuals allegedly members of the anonymous hacktivist collective as part of an international operation, according to interpol.the operation began in mid-february after police traced several high-profile online attacks originating from argentina, colombia, chile and spain, interpol said feb. 28. the attackers allegedly targeted websites belonging to the ministry of defense and president in colombia, endesa, a chilean electric company, and chile's national library, among others.operation unmask was coordinated by the interpol's latin american working group of experts on information technology crime. interpol helped share intelligence across national law enforcement agencies in argentina, chile, colombia and spain. based on the information, police officers executed more than 40 searches across 15 cities in those four countries and confiscated around 250 devices and mobile phones. payment cards and cash were also seized during the raids. the arrested individuals ranged in age from 17 to 40, according to interpol.“this operation shows that crime in the virtual world does have real consequences for those involved, and that the internet cannot be seen as a safe haven for criminal activity, no matter where it originates or where it is targeted,” said bernd rossbach, active interpol executive director of police services.four individuals in spain had been arrested for sabotaging websites and posting confidential data online, spanish police said before the interpol made its announcement. the server logs obtained as part of those arrests led the police to five suspects in colombia, six in chile and 10 in argentina, according to a report by agence france presse.

chardon, ohio - a teenager opened fire in the cafeteria at a suburban cleveland high school monday, killing one student and wounding four others before he was chased from the building by a teacher and captured a short distance away, authorities said.



a student who saw the attack up close said it appeared that the gunman targeted a group of students sitting together and that the one who was killed was gunned down while trying to duck under the cafeteria table.



fbi officials would not comment on a motive. and police chief tim mckenna said authorities "have a lot of homework to do yet" in their investigation of the shooting, which sent students screaming through the halls at the start of the school day at 1,100-student chardon high.

u.s. treasury dept. penalizes japan’s largest organized-crime group




washington — the treasury department has imposed sanctions on japan’s biggest yakuza group, an organized-crime syndicate that operates with relative impunity there and whose far-ranging criminal activity has become a significant concern in washington.




in an announcement on thursday, the department said it would freeze the american-based assets of the group, the yamaguchi-gumi, and two of its leaders. it will also bar any transactions between americans and members of the penalized crime syndicate. yakuza have been tied to drug trafficking and other crimes in the united states, with particular prominence in hawaii and california. the treasury did not elaborate on the dollar value of united states-based accounts that might be frozen under the new sanctions.

in a statement, the treasury said the group made “billions of dollars” every year around the world. its criminal activity includes prostitution, money laundering, fraud and trafficking in humans, weapons and drugs.

the action “casts a spotlight on key members of criminal organizations that have engaged in a wide range of serious crimes,” david s. cohen, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.

canadian targeted in montreal mafia sweep now faces prison for coke smuggling






montreal — a man who was once the target of a four-year manhunt now faces the prospect of a lengthy prison term for drug smuggling as his wife prepares to go on trial in the deaths of their two daughters while he was in hiding.





giuseppe de vito, 45, was targeted in project colisee, the police investigation into the mafia in montreal and its associates.
