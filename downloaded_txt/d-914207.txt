highly skilledi'm very pleased with the installation services of stafford mechanical services. mike is very knowledgeable about hvac products and what would work best for our home. the price was competitive and there were no surprises. things went smoothly from start to finish, and the two technicians that did the entire installation (elijah & wyatt) are highly skilled and know what they are doing. they also work hard and got the job done in a professional manner ahead of schedule.from now on, i will use stafford mechanical for all of my hvac needs.- william g.






professional, courteous, and very friendly
stafford mechanical services came to our house in february and submitted a clear and competitively priced quote for an update of an older gas furnace and the addition of a heat pump to create a hybrid system. the work crew that completed the project was professional, courteous, and very friendly. they completed everything in the time alotted for the project and left a pristinely clean work site behind. i happily recommend stafford mechanical services to anyone looking to have some hvac work done. our project manager greg was very pleasant and easy to work with.

kind, professional, and honest
i would recommend stafford mechanical to anyone after our experience. gary helped get someone to our house fairly quick and the tech who came was kind, professional, and honest. i would welcome this team to come back to our house for any future needs. the price was reasonable and much better than the quotes received from competitors. thank you so much to gary and the tech for taking care of us. we can happily wash our toddlers again with warm water ðŸ™‚ thank you to bob as well for being very responsive and helpful. nothing short of 5 star service.

strongly recommendstafford mechanical was one of three companies i called for a cooling solution for my home. i was undecided between central ac added to my existing furnace or a ductless mini-split. after talking to greg, we went with a 18k btu single zone mini-split to cool approximately 1k square feet. greg spent my money as though it was his own and didn't try to oversell me. i have zero complaints from beginning to end and the system functions exactly as i had hoped. i would strongly recommend these guys to anyone.- tyson f.






highly recommendthank you stafford mechanical for installing my new four ton heating and air conditioning unit. it was great working with you from start to finish. greg and the rest of the crew did a very good job. great guys and very professional. we appreciate your work pulling the job together and to install the new unit. definitely would highly recommend this company.- that breakfast place

excellent servicewe received excellent service from stafford mechanical. greg helped us plan our ductless system, and was always available to assist with the process and answer questions. sinjin went the extra mile in constructing the system so drainage hoses were less conspicuous and located in a preferred location. he also clearly explained how to operate and maintain the cooling system. the excellent quality of service was greatly appreciated!-Â  michael u.



excellent companythe crew showed up on time to disconnect my very old air conditioner system (ac) and install a new (ac). they checked to make sure it was operating correctly and before leaving they made sure everything was pickup up, leaving no messes. excellent company & very knowledgeable hard working crew. i highly recommend people hiring this company to handle your air conditioner & furnace needs. can also make appointment with them to do the yearly inspection/cleaning of your units.-Â  sheila d.
