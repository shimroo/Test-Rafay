stuff i love





*sigh*my new jeans.  i love them so.these may be the most flattering jeans on earth, or at least a close second to my all time favorite jelessy jeans (which died a tragic death when they split from one cheek to the other when i squatted down to pick up the little boy).i picked up these hudson jeans on sale at macy's - thank goodness they were on sale, because even at 40% off they were $95.  still, worth every penny.  snug in all the right places without pinching or pushing anything in a direction it ought not to go.  long enough (praise jesus!) for this 6'0 tall girl, in fact i have to wear heels with them.  my legs look about 10' long in these jeans.  they've got a bit of stretch, so they're comfortable to wear all day, even if i have to crawl across the floor with the baby.  best of all is the butt pockets.  i will not buy any garment meant to cover my butt that doesn't have rear flap pockets - everything else is just horribly unflattering.  not only do these have the flap pockets, but they're pointy!  making me appear to be even slimmer!  genius!

stuff i love





i had to get a new phone.  the former phone was pretty much only good for talking, and even for that limited use it wasn't great.  i've gotten to a point with work where clients need to be able to have me respond to emails pretty quickly, even if it's just to confirm that i got it.  i also needed something that played nice with my mac but that wasn't going to cost me $400 and require that i wait until the end of june for the new iphone (as sweet as that iphone is, i'm just not digging the touchscreen when it comes to texting and emailing).the lovely boys at my local at&t store, who know me well by now based on the frequency of my visits with issues with the last phone, recommended the blackberry.  so far, i'm pretty happy with it.  sure, i wish that when it synched to my mac it would do it via bluetooth (nope, need to be connected via usb cable), or that when it imported my address book contacts it retained the pictures that i had associated with most contacts (frustrating, but not a deal-breaker).  but overall the coverage is excellent, the battery lasts a good long while, and the keyboard is super easy to use.  best part is, i'm going to play with it for the next three weeks and if i'm not still loving it, i'll return it and wait a couple of weeks for the new iphone.

getting my move on





at long last, we're moving home.  it's been almost two years since we left our house in town, and i've missed it for most of that time.  we were able to find a tenant for our mountain house, and so early in june, we'll load up the truck and move back down the hill.it was a hard decision for us as a family, because a loves the mountain house.  he loves the solitude and the scenery and the space (both inside and out).  but for me, things changed when valentino was born.  i don't want to put him in his carseat for 40 minutes at a time, twice a day, just to drop him at the nanny's.  i don't want him to be limited to visits with friends and family to only those times we come down the hill with specific plans.  i want to be able to plan days at the park or the pool and be able to come home for a nap, instead of having to plan my day around being gone from home the whole day, because it's too far to go home for a nap and leave again.  i also want back that hour of commute time each day, so that i can spend it with my boys.to say that i'm thrilled about the move would be the understatement of the century.  i'm not even stressed about the actual move event (although for me, that part is trivial, i have lots of practice - this will be my 21st move in my 37 years).  we have wonderful friends who've offered all manner of help with getting ready and the actual lifting of my furniture.all of this reminds me is that things usually work out for the best.  i was getting miserable in my home in the mountains, and i truly knew that i needed to move back.  we were able to make that happen.  i'm forever grateful to my husband for knowing just how badly i needed to do this, and helping to make it happen.
