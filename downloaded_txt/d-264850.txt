                                            receive every time i go. they never rush or make me feel they need to
                                            move on to another patient. they even offer a blanket to keep me warm
                                            while they work on my teeth. they also show an interest in me as a

                                            step-by-step instructions!
 







		you asked, we answered!
	

		our team at dental wellness of lexington believes strongly in you being an active part of your treatment, which is why we’re always here to provide recommendations, share advice, and answer questions. while you’re more than welcome to talk to our team over the phone or at your next appointment, many patients also like completing some research online beforehand. if that’s the case for you, then read on for the answers to faqs!
	


			how can i find a female dentist?
		

			look no further than our lexington dental office! we’re proud to have three dedicated, talented, and exceptional female dentists, dr. maxie combs, dr. carol wilson, and dr. amita patel. although their educational backgrounds and journeys to dental wellness of lexington are unique, they share the same passion for delivering world-class dentistry, and they would love to help you achieve your smile goals!
		

			of course, if you aren’t in the lexington area, then it may be helpful to ask family, friends, and coworkers for their recommendations. you can also search google for “female dentist near me,” which can provide you with a list of providers in your area.
		

			what do you do if you can't afford a dentist?
		

			there is a common misconception that dentistry is expensive. in reality, a study from
			
				the journal of dental medicine
			
			found that every dollar invested in preventive care can save you between $8 and $50 on restorative and cosmetic dentistry. so, the best way to keep your dental treatments affordable is by prioritizing good oral hygiene best practices, like coming in for a checkup and cleaning every six months.
		

			our team is also proud to offer our patients several financial solutions so cost isn’t the only thing standing in your way of getting the preventive, restorative, and even cosmetic dentistry you desire. we welcome dental insurance, happily accept flexible financing through carecredit, and offer periodic special offers to help you save on popular treatments.
		

			what level of education is required to be a dentist?
		

			as you may know, becoming a dentist requires years of schooling as well as a commitment to continuing education. the journey begins by earning an undergraduate degree (which is usually in a major that’s heavy in math and science). then, the aspiring dentist needs to be accepted to one of 67 accredited dental schools in the us. even after earning their doctor of dental medicine (dmd) or doctor of dental sciences (dds) and becoming a licensed dentist, they need to pursue additional training annually to stay abreast of the latest techniques and technology.
		

			how do i get emergency dental care?
		

			priority number one is assessing your situation. if you’re experiencing potentially life-threatening symptoms in tandem with your dental injury (i.e., difficulty swallowing, uncontrollable bleeding, trouble breathing), then you need to visit the er for medical attention. if you aren’t experiencing any potentially life-threatening symptoms, then your first call should be to our lexington dental office. we do our best to accommodate emergency patients with same-day treatment. that way, we can restore your beautiful, functional, and pain-free smile asap.
