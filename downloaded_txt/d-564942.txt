testimonials








{what i love most about being part of the pd committee are the relationships i’ve made. it’s also been such a fantastic way to give back, feel part of this incredible community and have a say in the opportunities we give to members for professional development. it gives me sense of accomplishment and purpose within the chapter.



dominique mas




{i am a solopreneur and do virtually all of my coaching online; it can be lonely at times. volunteering on the membership engagement committee for icf new york city helped me to address a major challenge that i was facing.
how do i avoid being isolated and create a community of peers to ensure that i routinely interact with, and learn from, other coaches?  (more…)



brian gorman




{it’s been a very good experience creating programs that have a true impact on our community. the power of our practice is truly felt by those who have not had the chance to have a coach and to see the tremendous turn around in the client makes me know that the work we are doing not only is needed, but is wanted and embraced in the local community. i look forward to creating more robust and sustainable programs that the community can come to expect.



angelo moultair




{volunteering has been personally fulfilling to my humanitarian driver and affirming to why i pursued coaching. serving as a pro-bono coach enables me to bring the power of coaching to people who might not otherwise get the benefit from it in their lives.
