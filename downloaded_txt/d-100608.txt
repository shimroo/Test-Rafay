boom! bang! twang! album sampler by steve ellis on vevo.boom bang twang!iconic mod-soul vocalist with 1960’s chart-toppers the love affair releases new studio album ‘boom bang twang!’ produced by paul weller, charles rees and steve ellisnew album reunites  steve with the sony label and coincides with the 50th anniversary of uk number one ‘everlasting love’ released on cd, limited edition vinyl & download 20 april 2018“maybe if we live long enough, we grow into what we always wanted to be. just maybe, if we stick at what we love, it’ll  come around and come good. steve ellis has earnt the right to sing the blues if he wants. and sing it he does!” paul welleron 6 february 1968, one of the uk’s most  endearing number ones - everlasting love  - hit the top of the charts. the group behind it were called love affair fronted  by singer steve ellis who was acknowledged as having one of the best soul-rock  voices in the business. with their sharp mod looks and a host of national tv  appearances behind them, love affair found themselves enjoying the kind of  exposure and adulation that was being afforded to the likes of the beatles and  rolling stones. their version of everlasting love remains a stone-cold classic, one which not only reached  number one in the uk, but went top 10 in 7 other countries and has amassed over  10 million sales to date. its enduring charm has seen it copied by everyone  from u2 to the cast from casualty, as well as appearing in numerous films and  adverts globally. however, the only member of love affair to appear on the  actual record is steve ellis and it’s this fact that provides the backdrop to a  50-year tale of triumph, tragedy and resurrection. 2018 marks a very important anniversary for  steve ellis. in the same year that everlasting  love celebrates its 50th birthday, steve releases a new album ‘boom  bang twang!’ on 20 april, 2018. fittingly enough it reunites steve  with the label where he enjoyed great success with love affair � cbs/sony � and  is an expertly crafted mix of new songs and some heartfelt covers with guests  and long-time friends paul weller, cow, manfred mann’s mike d’abo, kev wallbank  (the dream foundry), andy crofts and ben gardelier (the moons). ‘boom bang  twang!’ is the work of a man who believes in not resting on his laurels. ‘boom bang twang!’ shifts effortlessly  through soul, rock, rhythm & blues, reggae and pop with all the quality one  would hope for from an artist who’s been there, seen it, done it, and still has  the t-shirt. the first single lonely no  more, co-written with paul weller, is a glorious northern soul-esque shaker  absolutely primed for radio. soul trek is  another stand-out. utilising an exquisite john schroeder string arrangement,  steve delivers an outright corker of a song. forever (written by cow) is a real sweet, catchy love song; forgot to be your lover a truthful and  respectful cover of the william bell classic, whilst gerry marsden’s don’t let the sun catch you crying runs  deep, soul deep. cry me a river (again with paul weller) is a nitty gritty rhythm & blues stomper, jimmy  cliff’s sitting in limbo gets the  steve ellis makeover as does tim hardin’s black  sheep boy, whilst album closer oh  death, sees steve explore psychedelic blues to dramatic effect.the steve ellis story begins in1966 when  as a 15-year-old, steve got his first professional gig singing in a group  called the soul survivors. after the band’s first release on decca, they moved  on to the cbs label and became one of the most successful british pop acts of  the late 1960s under their new name ‘love affair’. affair scoring a string of  chart busting singles in 1968 including everlasting  love, rainbow valley, bringing back the good times, one road and a day without love, in autumn 1969, steve ellis walked out of love  affair to re-think his musical direction. cbs retained him as a solo artist and  his future appeared decidedly rosy. steve seemed to have the world at his feet,  but it didn’t work out that way. some excellent solo singles and a killer  soundtrack (loot) failed to ignite,  then came stints with 2 new bands - firstly under the name of ellis - followed  by one album with rock super group widowmaker - before another solo album was shelved  due to contractual issues. this was followed by tragedy when, having given up  on the music industry to work as a docker in order to get “match fit” and to  re-think his next musical step, steve suffered a most horrific accident or as  he calls it “an altercation with some two-tonne forklift blades.” an incredibly  brave, 8-year fight to regain his mobility ensued and led him back to music in  the early 90s. for the best part of the next 10 years,  he toured as steve ellis’ love affair and once again found himself being cited  as a mod hero to a new generation of fans whilst retaining the support and  respect of his own musical peers. one  such occasion was the 2001 steve marriott memorial concert (held at the  astoria), a much-revered show which saw steve perform alongside noel gallagher,  paul weller, peter frampton and small faces’ ian mclagan and kenney jones. in 2004, it was somewhat fitting to see steve  joining pete townshend, ronnie wood and slim chance for the unforgettable  ronnie lane tribute show at the royal albert hall.the past few years has seen steve release  two acclaimed solo albums ‘best of days’ & ‘ten commitments’, as well as touring  regularly and generally applying himself at what he does best - singing and  performing from the heart with that tremendous (and most definitely intact)  voice of his. now back with the label where it all happened originally and with  a fine new album to unveil, steve ellis has come full circle. album track listing:1. black sheep boy2. sitting in limbo 3. soul trek (holy blue) 4. tobacco ash sunday 5. forever 6. forgot to be your lover 7. lonely no more 8. don`t let the sun catch  you crying 9. cry me a river 10. glory bound 11. oh death pre-order here:https://www.amazon.co.uk/boom-bang-twang-steve-ellis/dp/b07985bxjtnew single for release in the autumn.recorded at black barn studiosproduced by sir charles rees/paul weller/steve ellis.best of days available on angel air. catalogue no. sjpcd469see review on sea of tranquility herenew box set out 29th junerpm records have compiled a 3cd box set of all the cbs recordings by the love affair and also steve ellis' solo material. available to buy from 29th june 2015. for more details go to http://shop.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=5081 cow  & steve ellis coming soon......double  a side vinyl 45 single limited edition"rise"  and "up"mark and maxine from the band cow met steve ellis (voice of the love affair) in a clothes and record shop in brighton in the summer of 2013.we started gassing about various interests, mainly music, and we struck up an instant friendship.steve mentioned that he was thinking of putting together a new solo lp of his own material and songs from other writers too.we sent steve half a dozen of our own songs waited for a bit, then steve suggested we record two of the songs together, we spent a few days at black barn studio in ripley surrey, and the job was done !engineered by sir charles rees and with a little help from some of our mates.....including kenny carrol on keys, paul weller on guitar and piano, tom heel on drums, andy lewis on bass guitar and kev wallbank on tuba....the double a was in the bag!the single is due for release soon with "rise" going on steve's new album and "up" being put on cow's new album both due out later this year.enjoy the sneak previewlove and more lovemark, maxine and stevexfor pre-orders please contactmaxine@cowmusic.co.ukbe happy and soulful but most of all keep the faith...cherry red records are set to release the definitive steve ellis and love affair collection on a three c.d. box set scheduled for release in june. more details to follow including catalogue number and how to order in due course.disc 1. love affair the complete recordings + rare bbc sessions never released before.disc 2. love affair. new day  with gus eadon.disc 3. steve ellis. the lost masters  remixed and containing over twenty classic tracks.widowmaker -
