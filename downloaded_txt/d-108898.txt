	fshod - fearlessly seeking honest open disclosure
	
  

in this blog we discuss science, space, spirituality, esoterica & the failure of governments to disclose the truth about nearly everything important to humankind!  this sometimes requires activation of the flying shithook of death!
fshod is a 'members-only' blog.  to become a member, email fshod@hotmail.com
