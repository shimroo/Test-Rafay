landing zone

























 
 welcome  to the landing zone for forays into another country, a creative works country  populated largely by gentle beings of a collective mind. and sure, here is  warfare for our virtual reality offers authenticity; however, the aim is to  gather scattered consciousness into baskets for weaving into threads of the  mind â peace, sisters and brothers, toward peace.
  expect  hawking (pitching sales) of books, periodicals and music; we survive in a cacophony of  energy exchange systems and among them, unfortunately high on the totem, is  money â scratch, bucks, lucre (filthy or otherwise).
 new  slices from pies fresh from the oven will be available weekly or daily as the  muse inspires, in short videos and printed lines of poetry and/or narrative.
 welcome,  and if you, fellow traveler, have snippets of creative fare please send samplings  to us to possibly share alongside our own scatterings:

forward to conscious  scattering of dust
 
truth  escapes us.
we  paw at its periphery, discern vague shapes of a face. but ever will truth elude  us, is beyond our finite grasp.
this  revelation does not mean we should cease trying to find what is true, however,  as searching for the core of life's reality is a constant thread in our being,  in all our experience.
how  is truth related to time and space?
all  are realities of existence, of life defined beyond egg and sperm notions we  fragile things on earth imagine.
and  if we were more aware, would we realize the spark within our dust is not frail  and fragile at all, but is that alpha and omega which survives.

conversations  linking souls in passage

connection  to sands of long ago
 
we  are more than unheard cries at night, who
come  in pain and agonize upon the rack a spell
before  falling into a frigid sea
â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â we have shed our cloaks
upon  the forest floor
celebrated  in redwood groves
danced  circles above the wind
â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â lives filled, overflowed
with  visions of ages past, ages yet to be
and  the orphan has shared bread with us, may
recall  our names on return to castles

crowds  suckle on the earth, and
all  are brothers, sisters
â â â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â yet how few the intimate
sprinkled  upon corners of the world
to  this family
are  these words
this  scattering
of  dust

introduction to  readings
 
coming  before you to entertain
yet  not as entertainer
 
to  educate
yet  not as teacher
 
to  prophecy
yet  not as prophet
 
offering  synthesis, pallet of color
splashed  into vinettes
â â â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â  â â â â â â â â â â â â â  â â â â â some ripped from heart and soul
some  come as rain from heaven falling
gentle,  easy into buckets
 
from  crossing of mountains
and  highways and seas
 
through  kind fate
cruel  karma
life,  a speckled journey
 
and  whatever seeds of passion we sow
to  share them
that's  what i know
what  i care
