what people are saying…










brigitte had all the poise and patience of royalty. i have been involved in many real estate transactions (as an investor, not a realtor) and i have not seen as many problems with one transaction, which this particular sale was my previous home. each hump (some mountains) that found us, brigitte would contact me and give me full spectrum of my options. i felt fully confident of her knowledge of each situation. brigitte stayed calm through each long step on my journey! i told her after the final closing table (we went twice to a closing table) that she "was my woman" for now on for realty transactions. thank you so much, brigitte, for all your efforts and expertise!-natalie g






daniel helped my parents navigate their options when they were trying to decide whether or not to sell their house. he was kind and patient. he showed them their options and spent time helping them. he never rushed them or tried to force them to make a decision. he was very professional but also very caring. i would highly recommend him.-kim d
