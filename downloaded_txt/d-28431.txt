about catnap
catnap is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to creating lifelong relationships between companion animals and their adoptive families. we will provide shelter and care to all healthy and treatable relinquished, abandoned or transferred kittens and cats until we can bring the adopter and animal together for a lasting relationship.  we also have a low-cost clinic on site to provide low cost spay and neuter services, as well as other veterinary care, to rescues, tnr groups, and the general community.
