					it is also taught among us that we cannot obtain forgiveness 
					of sin and righteousness before god by our own merits, 
					works, or satisfactions, but that we receive forgiveness of 
					sin and become righteous before god by grace, for christ's 
					sake, through faith,  when we believe that christ suffered 
					for us and that for his sake our sin is forgiven and 
					righteousness and eternal life are given to us. (augsburg 
					confession article 4)
