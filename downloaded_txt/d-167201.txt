in western massachusetts and statewide, ces manages programs and services that focus on the educational, social-emotional, and health needs of children and youth

what we do
the collaborative for educational services (ces) is a public nonprofit, educational service agency that offers direct and support services to its 37 member school districts and to various state and district-level clients across new england. the work of ces divides roughly into three areas: a range of direct services for children and youth particularly those at risk; professional development and training for educators and professionals; and consulting services including community health, research and evaluation, and business services for districts, schools, and community organizations.













students are at the heart of our work
founded in 1974, we are a massachusetts educational collaborative governed by representatives from our 37-member school districts in hampshire and franklin counties. we work with children, youth, and adult learners; families; schools, districts, and educators; and community members in the pioneer valley and across massachusetts to create and improve educational opportunities both in and out of the classroom and ensure that every child has the opportunity to achieve their full potential. we are a community of innovative and effective professionals dedicated to improving education.
our mission
the mission of the collaborative for educational services is to develop and foster lifelong learning and to provide opportunities for wellbeing for all of the communities we work with, through collaboration and leadership.
our vision
we envision a society with equitable communities, led by the people within them. we envision a learning system within and deeply connected to those communities, which centers the histories and cultural identities of black, indigenous, people of color, and other marginalized groups, and supports all children and young people to discover their gifts and move boldly towards their futures.

read our land acknowledgement



























social justice and equity is critical to our mission, reflected in our organization’s values
a culture of community and care: we will look out for and support each other, celebrate each other’s successes and grieve each other’s losses. we will live out an ethic of community care, learn from mistakes, and be challenged to do better. we will foster speech and discourse, formal and informal, that promotes equity, justice, and understanding.
equity and inclusion: we will work to eliminate racism and other injustice and oppression, and promote inclusion and equity at ces and in our community by identifying and dismantling all forms of social oppression. our vision of social justice is intersectional and means working to transform all types of oppression, including racism, ableism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, adultism, ageism, transgender oppression, and religious oppression. 
self-awareness and growth: we will continually reflect on our own cultures and identities, and how they relate to or allocate power and privilege; and we will learn about and partner with others to challenge our own biases. we will make a personal commitment to growth toward equity, inclusion, and a community of care; and know that learning happens when we commit to being brave. 
action and transformation: we will take action, speak up, and propose solutions when we see oppression or discrimination; knowing that saying nothing means colluding with oppression. we strive to decolonize teaching practices, learning methods, and curricula through the accurate inclusion of the voices of people and cultures most impacted by white-supremacist narratives. we will be willing to make mistakes, and learn from both our mistakes and successes, in order to grow.
 

















ces has been a tremendous resource to our schools. the opportunities you offer for administrators and teachers to gather and share experiences, resources, etc., have been enormously helpful. the workshops have been outstanding.
