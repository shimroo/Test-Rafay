science fact & science fiction concatenation




































usually futuristic, science fiction speculates about alternative ways of life made possible by technological change.
the science fact & science fiction concatenation is the 
seasonal review of science fact and science fiction. formerly the (1987-1997)  
annual (paper) magazine distributed at the british national sf convention and european sf 
convention.  today its three principal internet editions come out in the northern hemisphere's 
academic year: spring, summer and autumn.

january 2025 news
our thoughts are with those who have lost their homes and nearly all their belongings to the wildfires in califorinia, usa.  this is a tragedy for anyone and it also appears a number of sf fans have been affected. let's hope all are safe. stuff is just stuff; lives aren't!
 
the sci-fi london film fest is back for 2025!  last year, due to cineworld closing the community cinema venue, the event was truncated to a single day event of shorts. this year it is back to a four day event at a new venue just north of central london.  it will be held 19th - 22nd  june, 2025, at the picturehouse cinema, finsbury park, london.  finsbury park has a rail and underground/metro station just around the corner from the venue (which, if you are visiting and want an extra day of central london tourism, makes for a good base, less expensive than central london accommodation).  there are plenty of hotels near-by such as the farringdon travel lodge.
 
2000ad is launching its official podcast 15th january.  just search '2000ad thrill-cast' and subscribe on apple podcasts, spotify and the major podcast apps.
 
 
new up...
we have our 'spring'* season edition.  as usual, this includes an extensive, seasonal full news page, with its  film news;   television news;    publishing news;   general science news  and   forthcoming sf books from major british isles sf imprints for the season, among much else.  there is a lot to unpack here with many links to youtube trailers and other videos, so take time to make a mug of tea, settle down at your pc or with a laptop or pad, and dive on in.
* 'spring' season here being the northern hemisphere, academic year spring.
separately, we have a couple of stand-alone articles and convention reports.  plus there is the usual tranche of stand-alone book reviews.  something for every sf enthusiast and/or science bod.
                    ☺
for details of / links to the new content, scroll down to beneath 'most recently added' below.
   
forthcoming
mid-march 2025 we will have the first of our four, one-page pdf, short sf stories from the science journal nature. these science fiction shorts are weekly and behind a pay-wall.  so if you do not subscribe to nature you will not be able to see them.  however sf² concatenation has an arrangement with nature to get the respective authors' permissions to re-post what we consider to be among the best four of the past year. 
what's not to like?
