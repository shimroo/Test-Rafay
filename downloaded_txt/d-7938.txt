nasa data reveals role of green spaces in cooling cities

a recent study used nasa satellite data to identify a major gap in global resilience to climate change: cities in the global south have far less green space — and therefore less cooling capacity — than cities in the global north.

about giss
research at nasa's goddard institute for space studies (giss) emphasizes a broad study of global change, which is an interdisciplinary initiative addressing natural and man-made changes in our environment that occur on various time scales — from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal and annual effects such as el niño, and on up to the millennia of ice ages — and that affect the habitability of our planet.
giss is located at columbia university in new york city. the institute is a laboratory in the earth sciences division of nasa's goddard space flight center and is affiliated with the columbia climate school and school of engineering and applied science.
