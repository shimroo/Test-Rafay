  i found these writings in my google drive that i had saved on various computers from way back in the day. these essays present an interesting mathematical point of view to those who struggle with or maintain the notion, of life sprouting on our planet from chance events during the history of our ~13.8 billion-year-old universe. even if you don't believe in creation, these essays give pause to the big question.  thoughts? given enough time anything is possible - even evolution by david n. menton (c) copyright 1991 missouri association for creation, inc.  this myth is the ultimate argument of those who attempt to "explain" the origin of the cosmos and all life by chance and the natural properties of matter and energy. evolutionists hope that by invoking immense amounts of time, highly improbable events can somehow be made probable. but with this type of argument, it is possible to "explain" anything. we've all heard it said, for example, that "given eno...

december 27, 2018








     i frequently travel for work around various parts of the united states and i usually use uber to get around. i'm only in town for a day and don't really need the extra expense or hassle of renting a car. i do not know the breakdown of ethnicities but a lot of the drivers are from out of country and have come to the u.s. to make a better life. i talk to all of them, at least the ones who want to talk- fascinating stories and friendly people. interestingly enough, there is one conversation that is common with all of the uber drivers i've had it is the topic of homelessness in america, but more on that topic later.        some of my more memorable drivers were people from iran, jerusalem, malta, ukraine and iraq. almost a pattern, isn't there? the iraqi was my driver on my way back home here in the sacramento area and was moved to the u.s. after serving as a translator for the u.s. military the last 5 years. the u.s. moved his whole family here and they g...

  big news about the national walkout day to protest gun violence. it was nice to see kids get involved with something as large as this, but i would imagine very few of them thought about anything past their "children over guns" and "we need gun reform" signs- which i'm sure their parents were more than happy to help with.           if anti-gun people can present an argument that reforms guns without taking away the rights of millions of responsible gun owners then i would at least be of the mind to listen to them.  you cannot argue emotion and all they argue is past tense. they present emotional arguments with no rational thoughts on the outcome: "how many dead kids are enough?", children over guns, children shouldn't be afraid to go to school. if you want more gun control then speak in future tense. tell me how you want to do it. (i already know how they want to do it. the big sign above tells all).         i agree with all of their sentiments. i...

december 02, 2017











   let me start by saying that i really don't give a shit about all the kneeling, kaepernick, or anyone else who jumps on this bandwagon. perhaps i don't really understand why they are kneeling in the first place- because after reading kaepernick's own words, and not someone interpreting his reasons for kneeling, i just don't get it.    "i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," kaepernick told nfl media in an exclusive interview after the game. "to me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."   he can't show pride in a country that oppresses black people? an entire country that "oppresses black people"? that is about as broad a statement as you can make, and if it weren't for the media who love to stoke the racism poop pile,...

november 25, 2017











 the events in egypt have reminded of some great dialogue from pat condell who freaking nailed it so many years ago when he was embarrassed for the u.s. and the new mosque that was being built so close to ground zero.  any religion that endorses violence is incapable of delivering spiritual enlightenment - how obvious does that have to be? - and it has no right even to call itself a religion. without the shield of religion to hide behind, islam would be banned in the civilized world as a political ideology of hate - and we have no obligation to make allowances for it, any more than we do for nazism.  it's a bigger threat to our freedom than nazism ever was. yes, both are totalitarian, and both divide the world unnecessarily into us-and-them, the pure and the impure, and both make no secret of their desire to exterminate the jews. but we were all more or less on the same side against the nazis, whereas the islamonazis have got plenty of friends among people in the west who ought to ...

april 18, 2015











   on april 13 th child protective services “retrieved” two unsupervised children  from a park in silver springs, md. the meitivs are being investigated for child neglect after neighbors complained to cps that the parents repeatedly allow their children to walk to and from a local park unsupervised. the park is two blocks away, the kids ages 10 and 6 routinely make the trek back and forth from their home and they were not harmed in any way.      is this an example of people stepping up and protecting a child in need, or is it an example of buttinski do-gooders?      flash back to august of 2014, in the middle of a utah summer, when april suwyn  left her 11-month old baby in the car so she could run in her house to take a shit. didn't realize what she had done for two hours. oops! mother calls it an accident and one that could have been avoided if she “had just gone to the gym” like she usually does. really? oh, no charges filed. there are many more of these example of suffocat...

january 16, 2015











in an effort to keep racism alive in this country, the twit0sphere exploded with angry twits from clueless race baiters yesterday when the academy award nominee list revealed that there was not enough diversity on the list. within minutes, #oscarsowhite gained enough steam to actually become a thing thanks to the racist twits that flooded the internet.   after disappearing from the public eye after several news sources covered the horrifying death  of a st. louis white guy by several black teenagers (using hammers), al sharpton reappeared to announce that he would have an emergency meeting to discuss the unchecked racism running  rampant in hollywood. sharpton began his diatribe with a very soothing statement meant to ease tensions on the subject:     "the movie industry is like the rocky mountains, the higher you get,  the whiter it gets ,"  isn't that special? that will surely bring people to realize that race is a very important topic in this country and that it is a h...

veteran acc referee karl hess made an "ethnic" remark to former  chairman of the wake forest university board of trustees named   mit shah and is now out of a job. mit shah,  now the ceo of an atlanta-based hotel management company, is of indian descent and was born in new jersey, but he grew up in winston-salem. what could this 25 year acc veteran have said that was so devastating during a recent  louisville-wake forest game in winston-salem, north carolina, that it made shad jump on his twit account? hold on to your mouse. here it is:    karl hess to me at the wake-louisville game tonight..."when i'm older, i want to sit in your seat & watch your egyptian ass ref a game" #wow   wow? how about something a little more appropriate like this:    i'm such a thin skinned moron that i can't handle a retort from a referee whom i was flipping shit to. #tittybabiesunite!   hess was fired for this remark. really?      i can see the hyper...

december 20, 2014











   we all have our dmv horror stories, but when i left the island nation-good old boys club in 2007 i never thought i would have to deal with the backwards thinking, pain in the ass hawaii department of motor vehicles ever again.   wrong.   i lost the title to one of my vehicles and asked my bank to resend their lien release form so that i could send it to hi and get a duplicate title drafted. evidently, a lien release form signed by my bank is not good enough. the bank must send it in, because hawaii dmv is stuck in the 1920's and is apparently not aware of the newly adopted, but widespread use of, anti-fraud measures - like telephones.   a process that would take a normal dmv about 20 minutes to handle, is going to take (by my estimations) almost a month, hopefully. hawaii has a back log of these kinds of requests and the cosmically inefficient processes of this government run organization can only accommodate 3 or 4 requests a week (month?).   i called the hi dmv to see if there...

apparently not, as long as black continue to believe that white cops have it out for them. statistics show that white cops don't kill blacks any more than black cops kill black suspects, but let's not let these facts get in the way of the race relations of our country.      i'm a white guy and i cannot relate to the black guy's assertion that he is targeted by the police and profiled more than i am. perhaps that is true, however i do not put myself in situation that raises police suspicion of me. for some reason, the sweeping generalization that  "not all people who wear hoodies are criminals, but all criminals wear hoodies" comes to mind.       before you start shaking your fist at me, i do understand that their are racist cops, however i am just looking at the statistical data to support the ongoing claim that there is an epidemic of white on black crime, specifically by white cops.   from real clear politics :   between 1976 and 2011 across the united state...

november 01, 2014











colbert interviewed  anita sarkeesian, well known feminist and pain in the ass, on her rant against the "male  dominated " industry of gaming.    i saw this on the colbert report and i wanted to seriously 1v1 this delusional woman who is attacking the gaming industry to further her anti-man agenda. i wrestled over the thought of trying to write an informed but scathing post over this insanity, but someone already did.   i am so glad i read the comments section for this story because i found someone who is very informed on this woman and her agenda- that isn't about gaming, but more about taking things away from men. as a gamer, i can't count the number of times i have been handled by a female player and punished for being a split second too late with a trigger pull. s arkeesian, along with all the other feminist d-bags, need to really stick to lobbying the wnba and wpga. i'm sure both the viewers of those sports events would greatly appreciate the coverage.   here...
