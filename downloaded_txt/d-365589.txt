quality bikes that are the true representation of value.

 

for 20 years i have honed my skills and sharpened my tools to get to where i am now. desalvo bicycles can be defined with this simple statement: with confidence, i produce hand crafted bicycles that represent value in terms of build quality,  function, and cost. nothing to hide, what you see is what you get. i believe in honesty. mike desalvo

 




























































 

the builders special badass bikes that dont break the bank

 

the builders special is the best bike i can make at an honest value. no smoke, no mirrors, and nothing hiding under fancy paint. the builder special is a custom bicycle made to perform,  and built to an extremely high standard.
