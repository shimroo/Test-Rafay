know about nnwa





the navy nuclear weapons association (nnwa) is a nationwide organization of military and civilian participants in the us navy department nuclear weapons program during the years 1946 to present. many of our members meet annually in september or october at various locations across the us to reminisce with long-lost friends, provide support with veterans affairs and medical information, visit historical sites, enjoy quality entertainment in hospitable environs, and salute our departed. the nnwa invites you to join our society of cold-war “keepers of the dragon”©





 we publish semi-annual newsletters with information concerning our unique experiences while in the navy. we are a not for profit corporation governed by a membership approved by-laws, an sop/pdl and an elected board of directors we maintain a nnwa roster of all members, their addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, so that you may find some long-lost shipmates.

board of directors
