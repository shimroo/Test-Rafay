sfcc honors the legacy of us senator diane feinstein










the san francisco conservation corps (sfcc) is proud to honor the tremendous legacy of leadership and service of us senator diane feinstein, who passed away on september 28th at the age of 90. senator feinstein was one of the founders of sfcc in 1983, when she was serving as mayor of san francisco. she recognized the need for increased employment and educational opportunities for youth in the city and worked to found the corps with justice tony kline, who has since come back on to the sfcc board of directors. “senator feinstein was always a champion for the corps and an advocate for the opportunity youth sfcc serves,” said interim sfcc executive director james walker. sfcc is now one of 14 local conservation corps across the state and was the first urban conservation corps in the state. since its inception in 1983 sfcc has worked with approximately 6,000 youth who have provided more than five million hours of service to the community. in 2018, senator feinstein took time to make a video recognizing sfcc on its 35th anniversary and to celebrate its achievements. her leadership will be missed and  sfcc send its condolences to the family of senator feinstein.
