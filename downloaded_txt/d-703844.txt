appraisals (assessments)a manuscript appraisal (also known as a manuscript assessment) offers a broad overall assessment of your manuscript, outlining strengths and weaknesses – provided in the form of a report. specific problem areas may be flagged and general suggestions for improvement may be made, but a critique won’t provide line editing or scene-by-scene advice for revision. appraisals are tailored to your manuscript and will look at areas such as narrative development, plot, voice, tone, writing style, characterisation etc. it will provide an overview of where your manuscript’s strengths lie and where work is required to prepare it for publishing.

mentoring & book coachingsometimes we need a little more help and support than what the appraisal offers but we’re not quite ready for editing … this is where author mentoring comes in. mentorships offer you an opportunity to work directly with kit carstairs, maa director, in order to develop your manuscript, work on your writing technique, enjoy the support of an advocate generally while you sculpt your narrative. it is like having a good friend… who will give you the truth (the whole truth) and will push you in the direction you need to be pushed. we welcome authors at all stages of their writing career, however mentoring opportunities are limited to kit’s availability.
