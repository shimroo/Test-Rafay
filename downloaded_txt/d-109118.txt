cu is on a mission to highlight the impact our campuses - boulder, denver, colorado springs, and anschutz - have on coloradans' everyday lives. through our campaign “dear colorado,” we're creating an open dialogue with real coloradans to better support the things they care about.



 



strategic plan — fulfilling cu’s mission
between the summer of 2019 and the spring of 2021, the university of colorado conducted a collaborative and inclusive strategic planning process to identify common themes that would help guide the university for the next five years and beyond. priorities identified were collectively chosen by stakeholders involved throughout the process and will advance cu’s mission.
strategic pillars
 affordability & student success
 discovery & impact
 diversity, inclusion, equity & access
 fiscal strength
