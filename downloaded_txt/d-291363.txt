for over 30 years webebop has been a major resource for women's regular and plus sizes apparel. we started in berkeley as a small company that offered great casual styles, but soon expanded into a network that included thousands of boutique and department stores.
our goal has always been about quality and comfort which is why our generous fit has remained a key selling point. this is especially true for our plus sizes because the industry has made too many changes which has caused confusion to our customers. our customers value that we maintain a size standard that can be applied to all our styles which include plus-size dresses, plus-size tunics, plus-size swing tops, plus-size pants, plus-size skirts and many more.
at webebop we celebrate a woman's curves and take pride in providing great silhouettes that work for day or night. we have sourced the world to make our garments, including manufacturing in california, or importing great cotton styles from india, but our biggest success has been sourcing amazing handmade fabrics from indonesia.
our core product is made with the highest quality printed and solid rayon which is a natural, non-synthetic, fabric that breathes. what makes rayon special is that it drapes beautifully and if you machine wash in cold water and line dry, it will never fade and last for years. it's amazing to hear stories from our customers who are happy to share that they are still wearing webebop garments from 25-30 years ago!
we are always expanding into new designs that are welcomed by women from around the globe. in a world with cheap fast-fashion, our customers know that we are providing a quality designs at an affordable price. we also don't just develop what we think will sell, we listen to our customers and design in a way that creates community. at webebop, we are a family and strive to keep producing amazing clothing for years to come.
