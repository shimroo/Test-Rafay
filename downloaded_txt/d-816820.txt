css
the animations on this page use only css. the ball at the top has four independent elements: 1) the ball, 2) the yellow highlighting, 3) the background shadow and, 4) the floor shadow.
                 if you wait long enough you may see the animations go out of synch... the joy of css. view the source if you're curious.
