hi, my name is skipper, and i work in product strategy and design.


i start with a people-first approach and believe that the most sustainable success comes from supporting teams, not depleting them. start with the basics — focus on foundational research, work towards outcomes (not outputs). because great products start with strong, clear teams.through how this works co, i help growing groups transform complex challenges into clear paths forward through focused facilitation and strategic guidance. i combine hands-on work with proven frameworks to unlock team potential and drive meaningful outcomes — whether through a focused 1-hour power hour﻿ or a design sprint 2.0.with leadership experience from thoughtbot, softserve, and mediabistro, i help teams create human-centered experiences that drive business results. i also host the how this works show podcast and mentor folks through adplist as well as through my own coaching practice, drawing from my time at fjord ny and pbs frontline.

let's join forces!


whether it's around an open role, a project that could benefit from a fresh perspective, mentoring, or assisting with a connection, i'm here to help. let's get started...
