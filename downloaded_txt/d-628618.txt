tips on how to pass english psle composition
composition is one of the components of english plse. students are tested on language proficiency, sentence structure, creativity, and writing skills. some students struggle to come up with interesting storylines, and this affects their final score.
other challenges students face with composition writing include:

limited vocabulary.
simplistic compositions.
repetitivetales.
poor timekeeping results in incomplete compositions.

these errors tend to lower the score of english composition, and this ultimately lowers the overall english psle score.
english tutors help students come up with the right theme, character development, and story flow. here are some tips on how to pass psle english composition.

brainstorm before writing. many students start writing as soon as the timer is set, even before they know the plot, characters, or even the setting. this often leads some students to be stuck in the middle of writing the composition or have a broken storyline that makes no sense to the reader.
create an outline. this is a guide that students follow even as they create the storyline. for example, you can come up with the conflict and how it will be resolved.
go through past compositions. this is critical because tutors can identify where the students need to improve. the english tutor will also analyse different themes and focus on the most challenging ones.
practice writing regularly. students can work independently on this but also give the english tutor their written compositions for analysis.
read extensively. good composition writing is a reflection of how much a student reads. students who read books, newspapers, or magazines have a better vocabulary than those who don’t read. reading also improves writing skills.
stick to the instructions. some students often do not follow the requested storyline. even if the content is interesting, if the story doesn’t follow the given theme, students will get low marks.
proofread the composition before submitting it. this is a step that many students skip, either because they have run out of time or they are not interested in doing so. unfortunately, this means students may not identify spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors that will affect their score.

composition writing is a critical part of english psle, and failure to prepare for it may affect the score. this is why when parents enrol students in english tuition in singapore, they should discuss the depth of the lessons, including composition writing. this way, the student increases the potential of getting good english psle grades.

pros of english tuition

personalised learning

one challenge many students face with their studies is the use of the same teaching method for all students. unfortunately, this only means some students are left behind because there is no one-size-fits-all teaching method. some students need personalised learning, and this isn’t always possible.
this is where an english tuition centre becomes handy. the english tutor will analyse your child’s needs and tailor a teaching style that will have the best outcome.

builds student confidence

english tuition singapore provides a supportive environment for students to build confidence when preparing for psle english. outside of regular classes, some students don’t have support in preparing for the examination.

since english psle tests oral, composition, and vocabulary, english tuition is a great way to ensure students are ready to handle different aspects of the paper.

early intervention for struggling students

most students in singapore start tuition at an early age, and this continues in psle and secondary school. if anything, at least 90% of students in secondary school are enrolled in tuition. this is at least 20% higher than students attending primary school.

comprehensive learning

english tuition tends to be more comprehensive. the tutors focus on reading, composition writing, grammar, and listening skills. students also get lessons on their spoken english. since one of the psle english tests is an oral exam, the tuition is helpful.
since the tutors are specialists in the language, their attention to detail helps ensure the students are ready for english psle.
cons of english tuition
undoubtedly, english tuition has its benefits. however, it also has some challenges, both for the students and parents. here are some of the disadvantages:

tuition is time-consuming. depending on the challenges the student has, the english tutor may have to spend a lot of time helping prepare the student for psle english. this means the student may be left with very little time for other activities. 
english tuition can be costly. depending on when the student starts the lessons, parents may end up spending a lot of money getting students ready for psle. 
students become overly dependent on tuition. this is one of the main challenges of singapore’s tuition culture, especially if students start tuition in the first few years of primary school. some students even overlook their regular classes and instead focus on english tuition because they either prefer the tutor or the teaching style.

despite the setbacks, english tuition has its benefits, and they outweigh the costs. students have so much to gain from it, and with the right guidance, they can easily overcome the disadvantages.






benefits of having your child study earlier for psle



				january 5, 2023			

				january 10, 2023			





			by			 yvonne hernandez







primary school leaving examination (psle) is a yearly exam that primary 6 students are supposed to take before moving on to secondary school. 
there is no doubt that psle is a crucial milestone in every child’s life as it determines their path to secondary school. the primary purpose behind the psle is to asses children based on their knowledge and proficiency in everything they have learned in primary school, including subjects like english, science, and mathematics. 
when the time of the year comes, psle becomes the headline. the examination not only gets the children stressed but also the people associated with them, like their parents. 
a common question that crosses their mind is, “when shall we start preparing for the coming psle?” 
the answer to that question is not very complicated. start as early as you can!
this article will discuss the benefits of preparing for the primary school leaving examination beforehand. 

adequate time

starting early means getting enough time to prepare and identify weaknesses. for example, in the case of mathematics, having a solid foundation is extremely important. if you begin preparing early, you will have a reasonable period to cover the basics and convert them into your strength.  

finding the right tuition

finding the tuition that perfectly caters to your child’s needs is a task. starting early gives you the head start on finding a tuition centre that is reliable and effective for your child. many parents let their children start tuition as yearly as in lower primary years to prepare them for psle. psle math tuition is helpful as it helps students get constant practice and more time to work on their weaknesses. for instance, you can identify if your child is more productive studying in a group of children or if they understand better when they get individual attention to decide which kind of tuition programme to go for.

give time for each subject

another advantage of studying earlier is giving the desired attention to each subject. you can derive a study plan and divide your time among different subjects accordingly. 

practicing past year’s papers

starting early also means finishing early. this will save you time to practice past paper questions and evaluate your preparation. if you cannot solve the problems independently, you can still refer to the study material to try and reteach yourself during practice.

identify which study method suits your child best

having ample time on your hand means you can try and test different studying techniques and choose the one that suits your needs the best and is also the most effective. some children can study independently, whereas others require guidance and external support like tuition. therefore, it is essential to determine the best studying methods and techniques for your child to achieve the best results.

less stress and anxiety

the word ”examtly” calls for stress and anxiety. but this will not be the case if you are already prepared for the exam beforehand. instead, having a command of the study material will make you more confident to attempt the exam.
now that you know the benefits of early preparation say goodbye to psle-associated worries and start preparing!

psle (primary school leaving examination): it is an exam taken by the education ministry of all students in primary 6 before they move to the secondary level. this examination tests students’ proficiency in their respective languages (english, chinese, malay etc.), science, and mathematics. 
mathematics is considered one of the most crucial subjects as most students and parents fear math due to the many complex concepts and formulas, which is not a surprise as not everyone can excel at math. 
give this article a read to gather all the information you need about math psle.
patterns, challenges, and resources of math psle
for children to ace psle examinations, they should be able to comprehend and apply the knowledge learnt confidently. they should be aware of all the factors included in that examination, such as the pattern, syllabus, time limit, number of questions, etc. for math psle, the most updated resources can be found online on the singapore examinations and assessment board website. the next thing your child should be doing is to have a good understanding of mathematical concepts, rules, and formulas. they should be able to perform algebraic calculations, perform computations, analyze questions and apply the correct mathematical concepts when they encounter different question types.
the total duration of the test is 2 hours and 30 minutes. during this time, students have to complete two papers, paper 1 (which comprises 45 marks and has a 1-hour time limit) and paper 2 (which comprises 55 marks and has a 1 hour 30 minutes time limit), including multiple choice questions and short and long question answers. calculators are allowed during the test, so they should also have a grip on them. 
this exam includes questions for which students have to think critically to solve complex formulas, making them worried about the shortage of time. another problem is frustration when they cannot solve a particular question for which they have practised a lot. one thing to keep in mind is always to fill in the questions, even when the steps of a particular question slip out of mind. when situations like that happen, students should keep their cool and write as much as they remember to get marks for the calculation steps.

top benefits of english tuition in singapore



				december 12, 2022			

				december 19, 2022			





			by			 yvonne hernandez









english is the most spoken language, with about 1.5 billion speakers globally. it is no surprise that many countries, including singapore, have english as the default language. tuition is not unique to singaporean parents, and many opt for english tuition for multiple reasons. 
here are the top benefits of english tuition.
refine communication skills
since a quarter of the world’s population speaks english, it is the most recognized language in the world. when people converge in a conference hall, english is the language used. people who don’t understand it are forced to rely on interpreters. 
unfortunately, one may only sometimes have an interpreter, so learning and perfecting the language is the best option. when children attend english tuition in singapore, they can learn how to communicate using english effectively. 
the english language is complex
english, just like other any other language, has a vast vocabulary. no one can claim to have exhaustively covered the dictionary or the english vocabulary. however, regular practice will expose students to an extensive vocabulary and knowledge of more words they may never have encountered. 
english tutors use multiple avenues to expose students to a range of new vocabulary. they include reading books, both fiction and non-fiction. storytelling and spelling lessons are also great for expanding a student’s knowledge of the english language. 
students get better at spelling and pronunciation
many students struggle with both spoken and written english. this is more common among students who don’t speak english at home. although over 50% of singaporean homes use english as the primary language at home, many still use other languages, such as chinese and its dialects. 
this limits the opportunities a child has to speak english. english tuition gives students extra hours to learn english, which might be a secondary language for some families in singapore but is likely to be their primary language in the future. 
stimulates an interest in english
some students take english as a subject for granted because they can speak and write it well. however, english enrichment classes do much more than teach students how to speak and write correctly. 
they also stimulate students to develop an interest in english and all it entails. your child will learn to look beyond words and deeper into what they mean. unfortunately, english tends to have multiple meanings for a single word, and students are expected to understand the context, especially in advanced classes. 
discover an interest in english-related careers
all the great poets and literature experts started by showing an interest in english. when children attend english enrichment, they have the space to explore what english has to offer and if they can succeed in an english-based career, especially in singapore. 
children who develop an interest in reading early in life can progress to become great writers. english tuition hones these skills, and the tutors guide them to fulfil their destiny as linguists and writers.
english may appear easy, but many people struggle with it, especially if it is not their first language. english tuition is an excellent way to get students to develop an interest in the language and all it offers.






signs of an effective english enrichment class



				december 12, 2022			

				december 13, 2022			





			by			 yvonne hernandez









a child’s response to english tuition will depend on how well they fit in and their connection with the tutor. unfortunately, sometimes you may not be so lucky and have to ask for a different tutor or enroll them in another english enrichment centre. 
here are signs that the english enrichment class is effective. 
your child shows excitement when going to class.
this is one of the most visible signs that your child is enjoying english tuition sessions. you have made the right choice if your child is always excited about attending enrichment classes. when a child is happy with the session and tutor, they are likely to perform well. 
on the other hand, if your child appears to drag their feet when going to the english enrichment classes, you need to find out why. there is a reason they don’t want to attend classes. if this affects performance, parents may need to look into it and consider a different tutor or another enrichment class. 
regular updates from the english tutor
an excellent english enrichment centre will keep you updated on your child’s progress. if your child is progressing well, the english tutor will tell you. however, if there are challenges, the tutor should also point them out so you can see how best to help. 
an increased desire to read
one of the aims of the english enrichment class is to stimulate your child’s interest in reading. the enrichment class is effective when you notice your child showing more interest in books and always seems keen on reading. 
support your child by getting them books to read because the more they read, especially books that they enjoy, the more likely they are to maintain a deep interest in reading. 
an improvement in your child’s vocabulary 
when your child keeps reading, their vocabulary will get better. this is one of the benefits of reading. english enrichment classes encourage students to develop an interest in reading and writing to improve communication skills. 
when your child has a vast vocabulary, it opens their interest in the english language even more because they are interested in discovering more words and how to use them. 
if you are keen, you’ll notice a notable increase in your child’s vocabulary after attending english enrichment classes.
your child keeps talking about the enrichment class
another telltale sign of an effective english enrichment class in singapore is a child who never seems to stop talking about the class, their friends, and tutors. if the stories you get at the end of the day are centred around what happened in the english tuition class, then your child is happy and is enjoying the enrichment classes.
many parents assume that all enrichment classes are the same or that their children will be happy with their choice. however, it would be best if parents looked for signs of satisfaction or dissatisfaction in their child to determine the effectiveness of classes.






why your child needs cognitive training



				may 26, 2021			

				june 15, 2021			





			by			 yvonne hernandez






the human brain has different functions. some functions are essential life skills that allow you to be productive and successful. cognitive training for children involves the use of computerized programs designed to make these skills better. there are thousands of activities and exercises that the cognitive development learning centre uses to enhance cognitive functions. 
all children benefit from cognitive training. cognitive trainers believe that the brain evolves and that cognitive skills and the brain’s functions can be enhanced. while there are several brain training activities for adults, children are ideal candidates because their brains are still developing. 
children are still in the discovery stage. they are still developing cognitive skills. when you start training their brains early, you are likely to enhance the skills necessary for learning. 
the exercises help children to be more attentive.
one of the complaints teachers often make, especially on children who have just started school, is the lack of attention. this is not surprising because young children, especially those in preschool and early primary school, are excited about being in a new environment. they are impulsive, and their attention tends to wander. 
singapore’s cognitive development learning centre has various programs to test attention in children. the games and exercises are enjoyable, so children are likely to enjoy the tasks given for longer. 
these exercises have different durations, so at the beginning, children work for a shorter time. when they complete the tasks successfully, they progress to longer tasks. over time, children learn to complete all their assignments, irrespective of the duration. 
your child’s brain will start processing information faster.
when you ask a question, does your child spend a long time thinking about it? when your child goes to school, he will be expected to think faster. if he maintains a slow pace of thinking, he may have difficulty following the school schedule. this is likely to affect his performance.
cognitive training activities that focus on speed are perfect for helping your child hone his skills. not only will he start processing information faster, but he will also give the right responses to the questions asked. it will be counterproductive for a child to work faster and fail at the assignments over avoidable mistakes. 
the excises will boost your child’s memory.
many children struggle with learning because they are not able to retain information. fortunately, memory is one of the brain functions that cognitive training targets. the exercises test a child’s short and long-term memory.
when you enrol your child in the cognitive development learning centre for cognitive training, you will find out the state of your child’s memory at the moment and the improvement over time. 
cognitive training promotes flexibility.
when your child goes for brain training, he will be exposed to various exercises designed to test different functions. after introducing the various aspects of the program, the trainer will test your child’s ability to shift attention from one brain function to another. this enables the child to be cognitively flexible in thought and action. 
think of your child’s brain as a search engine and a central processing unit. when it functions optimally, you can easily identify your child’s cognitive growth. for example, if your child counts using his fingers, he should start showing signs that he is doing math in his head after cognitive training. 
when you reach out to the cognitive development learning centre, ask the differences you should expect after your child completes the cognitive training program. this way, you can keep track of your child’s cognitive development. 






online brain booster tips to improve your child’s memory



				may 26, 2021			

				june 7, 2021			





			by			 yvonne hernandez






“please, can you focus?”
“i taught you this yesterday!”
“don’t you remember?”
how often have you said these words in frustration because your child cannot recall what he just learned? this is sometimes worse if your child’s school performance is affected because of gaps in his memory. 
it is important to note your frustration could easily rub off on your child. instead of reprimanding your child for something that may be beyond his control, you can follow these brain booster tips. 
feed your child with brain-boosting foods
brain health is as important. when preparing your child’s meals, ensure you choose foods that will promote body and brain health. omega-3 fatty acids are essential for improved brain growth and function. 
whole grain cereals and vegetables are rich in antioxidants, which are helpful memory boosters. another important nutrient is choline. it is found in eggs, cauliflower, peanuts, lettuce, and beef. choline is essential for cell development, but it specifically promotes learning and memory function in the brain. 
ensure your child gets quality sleep
do you know why children sleep soundly and for longer periods than adults? yes, their bodies are still developing, and they tire faster than adults. however, their brains are also developing rapidly. the brain is also processing the information your child was exposed to during the day. 
sleep is regarded as a brain booster because it improves thinking skills, strengthens focus, improves memory, and positively impacts your child’s mood. a child who sleeps well is likely to be more attentive in class. 
attempt to use multiple senses simultaneously 
online brain booster activities for children often use patterns because children learn best when making connections. when you introduce activities that involve the use of multiple senses, children are more likely to retain the memory because of the connections.
for example, during hands-on activities such as gardening and baking, you can help your child with academic concepts he is struggling with. if he has issues with the alphabet or counting, you can start teaching him as you work together. multiple sensory learning encourages memory retention. 
play games
play is not just a means to keep children occupied. it is essential for brain development. if you feel your child has exhausted games available to him, you can introduce online brain training. you will discover various games that will test your child’s visual memory, auditory sensory processing, and other brain functions. 
online brain training games will also help your child develop several skills, such as decision making and critical thinking. 
limit time spent on electronics
while your television can serve as a distraction when you want your child occupied as you do your chores, you shouldn’t turn it into a full-time activity. children need to explore other activities to test their brain’s functions. 
children who spend much time before the television tend to be inattentive in school and are unwilling to explore other brain-boosting activities. if your child is a television addict, maybe it is time to introduce the television fast. 
without the tv, your child will find something more beneficial to do. for example, playing with his legos will help improve fine motor skills. he will also start sleeping better, which will make up for any grumpiness he feels because of the loss of his favourite pass time. 
if you are struggling to find brain booster activities for your child, brain training online will help give you age-appropriate activities for your child. 






what is the best age to introduce brain training activities to children?



				may 26, 2021			

				june 4, 2021			





			by			 yvonne hernandez






many parents wait for their children to join preschool before requesting brain training. usually, this is because they have seen that their child is facing some learning difficulties. however, brain training can be introduced even before the child reaches school-going age.
in singapore, children join preschool between the age of three years and six years. this age group is perfect for preschool and brain training because a child’s brain develops rapidly from birth to age 5.
introducing brain training during this period of brain development helps the child prepare for school in several ways.
exposes the child’s patterns of thinking
when children notice something that piques their interest, they are likely to spend a lot of time asking questions about it. 
brain training for kids indulges a child’s curiosity by introducing activities that will further nudge the child to develop deep critical thinking skills. in this case, one may argue that brain training takes advantage of the child’s curiosity to develop life skills, such as critical thinking.
while the child is naturally curious, brain training helps him develop a yearning to learn additional information.
exploration of new ideas
right brain training singapore appreciates that our brains are not static. the brain can take in new information and ideas irrespective of age. however, young children are usually more willing to take in new ideas. they only need the right environment to explore and learn.
brain training activities test a child’s limits and abilities to try out new things. this is why trainers keep introducing new activities or even elevate the expectations of the activities that the child has learned.
these activities introduce flexibility to a child and make learning easier and more fun since the child looks forward to learning something new.
improves cognitive skills
kids brain training targets several cognitive skills, such as visual processing, memory, attention, reasoning, logic, and auditory processing. these are necessary skills for learning. children who suffer from shortfalls in these skills, such as inattentiveness and poor memory, face learning difficulties.
when a child participates in the right brain training singapore, the trainer will identify the specific challenges that the child faces. if the child has challenges with visual processing, the trainer may introduce brain games, such as shadow matching, to nudge visual scanning and introduce comparison skills.
helps a child cope in a stressful environment
although it may not seem like it, children also get stressed. they are suddenly leaving a relaxed environment at home where a schedule was a foreign concept. now, the child is going to school, where he is expected to spend a few hours learning and playing. some children struggle to cope and can easily get stressed. when this happens, learning is affected.
brain training gives the child a chance to relax and, at the same time, expose the brain to its ability to adjust to different environments. instead of shutting down, the trainer shows the child ways of indulging in fun activities that help keep stress levels low. when the child finally learns to control stress, he will be ready to learn.
kids brain training activities help to stimulate and prepare the brain for learning. the board games, puzzles, books, and other brain training games enable children to learn all the necessary skills to succeed in academics and their social lives.






what to expect from an enrichment class for toddlers

				may 29, 2021			





			by			 yvonne hernandez






when one sees how many singaporean parents enrol their toddlers in enrichment classes, the first thought is likely to be the kiasu culture. parents in singapore indeed tend to be quite competitive when it comes to their children’s cognitive development and talents.
however, toddler enrichment classes are much more than an avenue for parents to give their toddlers a competitive edge. 
did you know that the brain grows fastest from birth to when a child turns five years old? most of the enrichment class for toddlers singapore caters to children between 18 months and 36 months. 
you don’t need to be present in the enrichment classes.
if this your first time enrolling your child in an enrichment class for toddlers singapore, you may be wondering if you need to be present during classes. well, it depends on the enrichment class you choose.
some toddler classes have enough staff to take care of the toddlers in the hours they are at the centre. as you know, toddlers can be a handful and require individual attention. 
unfortunately, since this is the first time toddlers are separated from people they have known since birth, they are likely to experience separation anxiety. find out how your toddler is coping in the first few days. if he spends his days crying, you may need to consider an enrichment class for toddlers singapore that requires parents to be present. 
toddler enrichment classes more than playgroups
enrichment toddler classes are more than playgroups. these classes introduce skills that will be helpful when the toddlers finally go to preschool in preparation for formal education. the games are selected to help toddlers build their socialization skills. 
toddlers learn how to share and listen to one another and their caregivers in a school-like setting. they also enjoy singing, listening to music, dance, craft, and storytelling. 
some enrichment classes for toddlers singapore choose activities, such as swimming, learning new languages, dance classes, and playing musical instruments to test the toddlers’ learning capabilities. 
before enrolling your toddler in an enrichment class, determine what learning and play options the classes offer. ensure you don’t overstretch your child with learning too many things since they are likely to resent the classes. 
enrichment classes get your toddler out of his comfort zone.
if you are worried about your toddler’s reaction to spending a few hours away from home, you are not alone. however, getting your toddler to a different environment will help him become independent faster. if you can get your toddler to enjoy an enrichment class, you will have an easier time sending him off to preschool when the time comes. 
enrichment classes should not stress a toddler.
when sending your child to an enrichment class for toddlers singapore, what are your expectations? these enrichment classes are designed to help boost a toddler’s growth. however, if the child is introduced to complex learning when he is not ready, he will likely start showing signs of stress. 
instead of putting pressure on your toddler to perform well, it is best to encourage activities that your toddler will enjoy. your child still has a lot of time ahead to learn and grow. so, take the pressure of measured achievements and just let him be a child. 
since the pandemic, most of the enrichment classes for toddlers singapore have had to cut down on the number of toddlers attending the sessions. the class sizes were cut even further for facilities that require parents to attend classes with their toddlers. before enrolling your toddler in enrichment classes, find out the measures put in place to keep the toddlers safe. 






occupational therapy for delayed developmental milestones

the majority of children achieve developmental milestones within the expected age. unfortunately, some do not, and this affects their ability to function and perform tasks well. occupational therapy for children aims to provide support to children with delayed milestones. 
learn more about occupational therapy for children here: https://brain.com.sg/blog/occuptional-therapy-for-children/
the first two to three years of a child’s life are quite defining. these are the years when a parent hears his first words and sees him take his first steps. besides the evident physical development, brain development takes place during this period. if anything, physical milestones depend on the brain’s development. 
unfortunately, some children do not follow expected developmental patterns. some have delayed or restricted development. when this happens, occupational therapy for children becomes necessary. 
sensory processing
some developmental delays occur because of sensory processing disorder. in this case, the brain fails to receive the right message from the sensory stimulation. in some cases, the response is false, or the interpretation comes in too late. this may cause a child to be clumsy or fail to respond in a way typical of all children. 
unfortunately, this makes learning difficult. parents also have a difficult time understanding why their child is struggling. occupational therapy for children helps address some of these issues. in some cases, it helps children catch up with developmental delays, while in others, it helps them cope with their unique situation. 
body awareness
by the time they join preschool, most children have an idea about some of their body parts, especially those that aid their senses. unfortunately, some children fail to use some of their body parts because of poorly developed muscles. 
occupation therapists look out for signs of poor coordination or neglected muscles. they then help the child to develop organization skills, fine and gross motor skills, as well as self-regulating skills. these skills will help children with poor hand-eye coordination, poor balance, and those who experience difficulty with self-care routines. 
guide children to know their independence limitations
children who show signs of developmental delays often do not know their limitations or even how far they can go to become independent. occupational therapy for children helps them to achieve their potential and achieve milestones they thought beyond their reach. 
for example, children who have delayed speech may assume they cannot speak, but they may say a few words with a little push. eventually, such children speak as well as those who spoke earlier. 
children with disorders that are there to stay are still able to realize their potential through occupational therapy. for example, some children may not be able to speak, but they can learn how to communicate. some may learn how to use sign language and gestures which caregivers can understand. 
occupational therapy is essential for children who fail to achieve their developmental milestones. however, parents need to remember that children develop at different timelines. however, if the child takes too long to speak or walk, it is best to seek help. 
some of the reasons behind the delay do not go away as the child gets older. so, waiting for the child to figure his way around is counterproductive. with the right support, children experiencing slow development can still achieve set developmental goals. 






how occupational therapy helps children with special needs



				march 24, 2021			

				march 24, 2021			





			by			 yvonne hernandez






a 2019 ministry of education report shows that singapore had approximately 32,000 students with special needs. 80% of these students had mild learning needs, some of whom were diagnosed with dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), and mild autism spectrum disorder. 
singapore appreciates the challenges parents and teachers face when it comes to teaching and caring for children with special needs. this is why it has developed different programs to make learning easier and the care of these children easier for caregivers. 
for example, in 2013, the government established the developmental support programme (dsp) to assist preschoolers with developmental delays or different learning needs. so far, dsp is available in 300 preschools and has catered to more than 2000 children.
dsp has various programs that support occupation therapy for children. preschoolers under this program have become more competent. they also find everyday activities therapeutic. 
additionally, singapore has been flexible when it comes to the curriculum used in preschool. children respond to different styles of teaching, including those with special needs. the ministry of education has approved six major curriculums taught using different styles.
this allows parents to pick the best preschool for their child based on his personality trait and learning capability. 
helps children cope in new learning environments.
children with special needs find it hard to learn in the same way as other children. others even have a harder time learning and playing in the same environment. occupation therapy for children helps them learn uniquely. 
occupation therapists help to assess the challenges the children have with either the school system or learning programs. they then find ways in which teachers can still communicate with the children such that they can still learn, but in a unique way.
identifies disorders that make learning difficult.
while some children with special needs are easy to identify, others are not. some children with sensory processing disorders, mild autism, and adhd take a little longer to get a definite diagnosis because their behaviours are often considered normal for children. 
sadly, unless occupation therapy for children is sought early, these children experience unique challenges that are often seen as carelessness, inattentiveness, too much play, and overall bad behaviour by others. the assumption is they intentionally take too long to complete a task or get easily distracted. 
some of these children spend years being reprimanded for their playfulness and disinterest in their academic work. occupational therapy helps to distinguish normal children behaviour from disorders. 
helps to control erratic reactions
occupational therapy also helps control erratic behavioural patterns, such as hyperactivity, emotional outbursts, impulsivity and poor attention. sometimes, teachers and parents struggle to identify triggers for reactions in children with special needs. 
occupational therapy for children studies their needs, the environment they live in, and the triggers to their reactions. some children prefer solitude, so when they are forced to play with others, they act up. 
some, like those in the autism spectrum, have no control of their emotional outbursts. they may be having a good time, and they are in tears the next minute. occupational therapy strives to help these children identify their emotions and ways to handle sudden changes in their emotions. 
occupational therapy for children is critical for those with special needs because it helps them have a semblance of normal life. therapists help them overcome developmental issues that keep them from performing daily activities, such as writing, playing, and reading.

language is a wonderful thing. it can make actually connect people and even the whole world. without it, people would not be able to understand each other. there would be no communication and interaction. good thing that we have language and surprisingly, there are a huge number of languages around the world.
if you are looking for good arabic classes singapore, you should check out berlitz language school. they are one of the most established and oldest language schools in the world, and they offer a wide range of language courses and at varying proficiency levels. if you want to learn arabic seriously, you should check out their site above.

in this article, we are going to focus on arabic and the reasons on why we should learn about it.
to start, lead with languages is going to tell us why we should learn arabic.
why learn arabic
connect!
arabic connects you to hundreds of millions of speakers around the globe
arabic, counting its many varieties, is the fifth-most spoken language in the world, with over 200 million native speakers of arabic and more than 400 million total speakers of the language.
arabic connects you to arab-american communities
in the united states, more than one million americans speak arabic at home, making it the fastest growing second language in the united states since 2010. these 1 million are among an estimated 3.6 million americans total of arab origin. these people make up diverse communities that represent different religions (primarily christian and muslim), countries of origin, and cultures, including first-generation immigrants and families who have been in the united states for generations. read more here.
the first reason that was mentioned above is that arabic connects you to hundreds of millions of speakers around the globe. arabic is one of the most spoken languages around the world and this would mean that learning how to speak arabic would enable you to understand and communicate with more people all over the world. now, katie will give us five more reasons on why we should study arabic.
top 5 reasons you should study arabic
within the next decade, job openings in the u.s. for multilingual employees are set to increase by over 40%, making it easy to see that learning a foreign language is more beneficial—and profitable—than ever before.
however, you may have doubts as to which language you want to focus on in order to ensure that you get maximum returns for your time and effort.
although arabic is one of the most difficult languages to learn, it provides vast career options closely followed by hefty monetary compensation. so while debating the worth of each new prospective language to add to your repertoire, factor in these five reasons for why arabic may be your best choice for business success:

rapid economic growth and booming business in the uae.

dubai and abu dhabi are both part of the uae (united arab emirates) and are examples of quickly growing economies and cities which are becoming global financial hubs. you may be under the impression that if you work in the uae you’ll have to be involved in the oil industry, but you’ll be surprised to discover that this need not be the case. read more here.
            one of the reasons above involves rapid economic growth and booming business in the uae. we all know about all the big business in uae and learning arabic will help you to take advantage of these different opportunities whether you’re interested in the oil business, the vacation industry, or the international exchange market.
now lastly, lowy institute will tell us learning arabic is really worth it.
learning arabic: is it worth it?
as a student of the middle east, i recently delved into edward said’s classic, orientalism. what struck me was that for all his disdain for orientalists, said makes mention of the fact that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, scholars of the ‘near’ east were, as a matter of course, fluent in sanskrit, arabic and persian. this was considered the baseline for acquiring knowledge of the region, but if someone mentioned today that they were fluent in all three, it would cause an audible intake of breath.
on return from my year spent in syria studying arabic, i was invited by my former arabic teacher in brisbane to speak to his students about my experiences in the middle east. their reasons for wanting to study arabic varied. there were postgraduate students who needed it for their research, others planning to work in the middle east, and some who had been on holiday to the region and wanted to maintain a connection with their experiences. possibly the most interesting category were those who had had nothing to do with the region but were just curious about the language.  read more here.
there would really be problems to be encountered along the process of learning arabic. it would always be present in any language learned. however, we should look at the brighter side of it. we should think about the good that it can do to us. we should think about the benefits we would have. learning another language would not bring you any loss because it will in fact, give you more gains and advantages.






executive functions issues



				december 18, 2017			

				december 16, 2017

executive functions consist of several mental skills that help the brain organize and act on information. these skills enable people to plan, organize, remember things, prioritize, pay attention and get started on tasks.
if your child has unusual difficulty getting organized, remembering things, doing homework, and finishing projects, he may have executive function issues. executive functions are cognitive skills we all use to analyze tasks, break them into steps, and keep them in mind until we get things done. these skills allow us to manage our time effectively, memorize facts, understand what we read, solve multi-step problems, and organize our thoughts in writing.
executive functions are mental skills that we all use every day to get things done. we use them to set goals, plan how we’re going to do something, prioritize, remember things, manage our time and possessions, and finish what we start. some children have weaknesses in executive functions and, regardless of how bright they are, struggle to do schoolwork and stay on top of tasks as a result.
executive functioning issues often go hand-in-hand with adhd, but kids without adhd can struggle with them as well.
some children have weaknesses in executive functions, and, regardless of how bright they are, they struggle to do schoolwork and stay on top of things they’re responsible for. some of these functions are more obvious than others, because they involve a child’s behaviour in the world — losing her jacket, forgetting her homework, not following directions. others are less obvious but just as important, especially for learning: retaining facts, solving problems that take several steps, figuring out what’s important in things she’s reading, putting things in a reasonable order when she’s writing.
there are several different kinds of tests that can be used to see what kinds of executive functions your child might be having a problem with.
neuropsychological evaluation
the most comprehensive way to assess a child’s organizational issues and determine their cause is a neuropsychological evaluation. this is made up of a set of tests, questionnaires, interviews, and observations that clinicians use to get a good picture of what each kid’s strengths and weaknesses are. the test shows how kids complete tasks and process information.
signs of executive functioning difficulties
organizational issues:
losing or forgetting important items on a regular basis
being unable to maintain a clean room, desk, or locker
time management difficulties:
struggling to be on time due to disorganization or poor planning
difficulty moving from one task to the next promptly
struggling to perform in school:
difficulty memorizing facts, digesting important information, organizing thoughts in writing, solving multi-step problems, and completing and turning in homework.
how to help if you suspect your child has executive functioning weaknesses:
• talk to your child’s teacher and ask her to give you a rundown of the things your child is struggling with.
• ask if the school psychologist can observe your child in the classroom. this can clarify the things he seems to be having trouble with, which will help you decide if testing is appropriate.
• have him tested? the most comprehensive way to assess a child’s executive functioning issues is a neuropsychological evaluation by a professional. kids can also be tested using questionnaires, like the behavior rating inventory of executive function (brief), or a psychologist observation and assessment like the cognitive assessment system (cas).
• after identifying your child’s specific issues, her teacher and school psychologist can work together to find ways to support her in the classroom, focusing on strengths and providing help where needed. a learning specialist can help your child develop tools and systems to support and strengthen weaker areas. for example checklists, planners, and other organizational and time management tools can help kids stay organized at home and school.






how can your child benefit from having a growth mindset



				december 9, 2017			





			by			 yvonne hernandez






 

 
a mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more people or groups of people that is so established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviours, choices, or tools.
a growth mindset is a wonderful gift to develop in your child. with a growth mindset, your child will feel empowered to persist and work hard in the knowledge that they will get better and more proficient at a skill. by contrast, a fixed mindset can stagnate a child’s talents and sense of agency. it is not helpful to tell children ‘they are a natural’ at a skill or hobby as it limits their ability to improve and excel.
the way we praise our children can have a profound impact on their mindset. research on praise and mindsets shows that when we praise children for being smart, it promotes a fixed mindset. it sends a message that their accomplishments are trait-based, and tied to something innate. in contrast, praising kids for working hard promotes a growth mindset. it sends a message that the child’s effort is what led them to success.
a growth mindset gives a child a sense of control over their skills. this ‘internal locus of control’ is empowering as opposed to an ‘external locus of control’ where, e.g., genes or ‘natural talent’ is identified as the reason for a child’s skills.
even if you think your child is talented and motivated in a certain area, one of the most precious life skills is a growth mindset. it is an attitude that will permeate every area of your child’s life from creativity, art, and music, to sports, academic work, and even their emotional development.
also, a growth mindset helps to give a child a path to improvement and learning as well as a sense of energy and resilience during the learning or training process. this makes motivation and productivity easier and even enhances emotional development and a child’s relationships.
toddlers have a growth mindset. they enjoy the process of playing, art and exploring rather than the result and are less interested in the result, e.g., painting a picture. they don’t reflect on themselves as ‘talented’ and just get on with trying and doing. they have big reserves of perseverance and will try and try and keep practicing new skills until they accomplish them. this is how they learn to pull themselves up to standing and start to walk.
alternatively, “in a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. this view creates a love of learning and resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
one of the best ways you can model a growth mindset is to speak candidly about the mistakes you’ve made, and what you’ve learned from them. speak positively about your mistakes and struggles, and this will show your children that taking risks and making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. explain to your children that trying hard things is what helps us grow, and you can’t be perfect when you try something hard!
people often confuse a growth mindset with being flexible or open-minded or with having a positive outlook — qualities they believe they’ve simply always had. my colleagues and i call this a false growth mindset. everyone is a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience. a “pure” growth mindset doesn’t exist, which we have to acknowledge to attain the benefits we seek.
practising growth mind set theory with children is a great way to get them engaged with subjects and activities that they try to avoid through fear of getting things.






here are those crucial questions you want to ask a speech therapist



				november 29, 2017			

				november 15, 2017			





			by			 yvonne hernandez







it is a common belief that speech and educational therapy for children is only meant for kids who have a problem with their speech and understanding of the languages. parents need to be aware of the fact that this notion is completely untrue and the idea needs to change. every child needs to visit a speech and language therapists who works on strength and weaknesses of a child’s language and speech skills and makes them better communicators. this is especially required in today’ scenario wherein, it is very important how you talk and express your self to other people. let us take you through the essential question you need to ask a language and speech therapist.
1. why does my child need therapy, even after being able to speak and communicate properly?
language and speech therapy is not just for children who have problems but this therapy is meant for all the kids who want to communicate better in future. there are numerous other skills related to communication, other than talking and these areas also need to be developed in order to help your child communicate better. these associated skills are learning to listen while communicating with other. listening also involves paying close attention to people while they are talking to them. other related skills involve visualization and comprehension, following instructions and express when not being able to follow a particular instruction. in order to develop all these skills the language and speech therapist works with the child to help them achieve better through communication. hence parents need to understand in the very beginning that speech and language therapy is meant for all and is very essential to know, understand and assimilate better and have an edge over the others in terms of communication.
2. why is the therapist busy playing with my child and when will he get to work?
many a times, when we go in for a session with a therapist we notice that he spends a lot of time in play, at least it looks like he is playing to us. what might look like play to us might be a very carefully crafted and thought out technique that the therapist is using to get to the child. play is also a great way to know and learn and therapy should be all about knowing more and learning through play. it is not always necessary that you need to get to work to learn. in fact children learn the most through play. therapists use this technique to familiarize with the child and also teach then new things through play. through play the therapist is trying to catch a glimpse of your child when he is uninhibited. this is far better than when a child is conscious of being judged by a therapist and goes into a shell. when the child goes into a shell it is very difficult to help him get out of it, hence doctors use play as a method and technique.
3. ask questions that you feel will enrich your experience and will be helpful to your child.
parenting is not an easy task and while we are at the therapist there might be several questions that you might feel that you need to ask but shy away from asking. you might restrain yourself for sounding silly or any other reason, but you need to understand that you are a novice and you need to be able to understand what is going on in order to help your child make the most of this experience.
