we were truly blessed in having mena catering for our wedding day. every guest later on told how amazing the food and the service was. we had heard of how couples sometimes don't get to enjoy their wedding food or appetizers, but we are very happy that that was not our case. their servers were so attentive in making sure that we and the wedding party enjoyed the appetizers as well. amazing experience, no doubt.

our wedding was a huge success thanks to mena catering.
                                        mena catering is amazing! especially lily de la osa our wonderful event coordinator. planning our wedding reception was a dream thanks to lily, she was able to create the perfect menu and dining style for us. her comprehensive knowledge and vast experience was a great help. leading up to the wedding she made sure we had all our bases covered whether it was the rentals or the flowers. our wedding went off without a hitch due in great part to lily, we couldn't have done it without her. everyone who attended our reception has not stopped gushing over how delicious the food was at the wedding. our guests loved everything from the hors d'oeuvres, the food stations, and the late night snacks. many of the guests have gone on to say that it was the best food they have ever had at a wedding. mena's servers were awesome too, they made sure that we didn't miss out on any of the hors d'euvres and our glasses were always full. i highly recommend mena catering to everyone, they made sure our special day was perfect

my husband matthew and i worked with lily from mena catering for approximately one year to plan our wedding. i cannot emphasize how pleased we are with words. lily was responsive throughout the entire process, catered to our requests, and was always transparent in what she needed from us. additionally, she took our ideas and transformed them into culinary masterpieces! for example, we wanted a simple cuban style buffet. in return we received cuban sushi rolls, amazing churasco, and a few mojitos to boot. set up was flawless, food was amazing, and lily even stepped in to give matt and i a drink when things became a little... stressful on the day of :) we wish we could do it all over again, and perhaps one day we will with mena.
                                        bottom line: excellent food, excellent company. our guests all commented on the quality.
