my family has been coming here for years and it’s one of our favorite places to camp! we love riding on the elroy sparta bike trail, and it’s convenient to have the option to rent bikes right at the campground. it’s wonderful to have access to flushing toilets, showers, running water, and electricity, and the pool is the perfect place to cool off when it gets hot. we look forward to camping at tunnel trail every summer!- kellee k.
