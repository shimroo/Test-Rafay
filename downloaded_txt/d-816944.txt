                    asked questions

 dublin

                    cctv ireland cctv dublin









black & white

                    (b/w) or colour?  

            the trends are with using colour cctv systems these days. the colour cameras

            provides clearer identification than b/w . but, in a low light condition

            like in 0.1 lux, you may need b/w cameras because they generally

            require lower illumination.


what

                    parts do i need?  

            camera body, lens, mounting bracket, cable, ac adapter are the basic

            parts to produce video and many economic mini camera packages come

            with all of these parts.  you may add a cctv monitor (if you

            don't use your own tv), quad splitter or switcher to combine more

            than one camera, time lapse vcr, outdoor housing case and other accessories.

            or, you may choose wireless systems to avoid cabling. network based

            web camera servers are popular for remote surveillance via the internet

            and for convenience in lan or wan systems.

 


how

                      many cameras do i need?  

            you can use 
 quad

            splitter or 4 channel switcher to combine

            up to 4 cameras into one monitor or tv. or, many "observation

            systems" come with all in one package, including quad or switcher

            built-in monitor and 4 cameras. if you need only 2 or 3 cameras,

            a switching system should be enough. if you only need one camera,  using

            a standard tv rather than special monitor will cut expense. you may

            need a 8 channel switcher or multi-plexer to see more than four cameras

            on one monitor.

  


do

                      i need outdoor cctv camera? 

            if you want to mount a cctv camera outdoors you will generally need to

            use   an

            outdoor housing case, with or without heater and/or blower. the heater

            and/or blower built-in housing cases generally require separate power

            supply. some cameras are made water resistant and don't need separate

            housing cases. some of them also have removable sun-visor covers.

   


do

                      i need infrared cctv camera to see in total darkness? 

            commercial infrared cameras, some of which are also water-resistant

            for outdoor installation, can see up to 30ft distance in total darkness.

            if you need to see farther, you may need professional infrared illuminators

            but they are usually expensive and complicated to install due to

            its emission of heat. infrared cameras work as ordinary video camera

            during daytime. most colour infrared cameras work as b/w ones at

            night. minimum 
 illumination

            for most b/w cameras these days is 0.1 lux so you will not necessarily

            need infrared cameras or illuminators if there is some kind of ambient

            lighting.

   


what

                    angle of view do i need for the lens?  

            widely used and recommended angle of view of the lens for surveillance

            purpose is 72o to 78o narrower will give you clearer pictures. wide

            angles like 92o can cover more area but it may not contain the required

            detail or may be distorted.

    


do

                    i need zoom lens?  

            a manual zoom lens of, for example, 3.5 ~ 8.0mm will allow you to

            manually adjust angle of view from 3.5mm to 8.0mm. 3.5mm equates

            to about 90o of diagonal view angle on 1/3 " sensor camera and

            8.0mm sees about 38o. auto zoom lens can be adjusted at the control

            centre or from your computer. 


do

                    i need dc drive auto iris lens?  

            a little of auto iris functions are built-in in most of cameras included

            in most observation systems today. but, when you use professional

            cameras you may need to separate dc drive auto iris, a motorized

            device to meet the changes of lighting condition of the sun. generally,

            auto iris device is not necessary for indoor application with artificial

            lightings. 

  


do

                    i need pinhole lens? 

            a pinhole lens with a tiny opening can be hidden easily in a wall

            or ceiling or other objects. many economically priced  mini

            cameras have built-in pinhole lens . a pinhole lens for professional

            camera is very expensive. 

  


what

                      monitoring system do i need: professional cctv monitor or standard

                      tv? 

            if you use 1 camera, a simple tv (which has  rca

            video input) is definitely recommended. even for more than 1 camera,

            if you use combiner like quad splitter or switcher, a tv would be

            fine. but, for special features like slave video output (to be connected

            to additional monitor), alarm systems or for packaged observation

            systems, you may need professional cctv monitors. 


what

                      type of cctv monitor do i need: quad screen or single? 

            unless it is necessary to see four pictures at the same time on quad

            split screen,  a

            switching system which shows the pictures one by one (you can control

            dwelling time) is recommended for its larger image. 

  


what

                    size of cctv monitor do i need?  

            12" was the popular size during over the years but these days,

            14" for colour and 17" for b/w have become very popular.

            or, 4" lcd monitor to place on the desk is another choice. 


what

                      video transmission is required: wireless, coaxial or multiple

                      wire (din)?  

wireless

                                                  systems can be convenient to

                                                  avoid cabling works, but can

                                                  be affected by high voltage

                                                  power lines nearby, unseen

                                                  razor waves, huge machines

                                                  like lathe, metal walls etc.

                                                  some wireless systems transmit

                                                  locally up to 300ft and others

                                                  up to 700ft. coaxial

                                                  cable is conventional in this

                                                  field and proper for professional

                                                  cameras. it goes up to 450ft

                                                  without losing the picture

                                                  quality. multiple wires like

                                                  din carries not only video

                                                  but also audio and power. it

                                                  can be extended up to 250ft.

                                                  for remote surveillance, you

                                                  should consider web cameras. 

  


is

                      a power outlet located close to the cctv camera? 

            or, should the power be supplied from the monitoring place? 

            for professional cameras, the 
 power

            source is better located close to the camera. you may use 12vdc ac

            adapter if the camera is installed indoors and if the power outlet

            is within 5ft. if a professional camera is installed outdoors or

            the power outlet is located far away, you should use 24vac ac adapter.

            for din cables, which come with pre-packaged

            observation systems or mini camera package, the power source can

            be close to the monitoring site, but the distance from the power

            source to the camera should be less than 250ft. 

  


do

                      i need video amplifier?  

            when you need to send the video image more than 250ft on mini 
din

            or rca cable, or 450ft on coaxial cable,

            you will need to use video amplifier.  you may also need a video

            amplifier when you want to connect one camera to 2 monitors.

    


do

                      i need time & date generator?  

            many observation systems  have

            built-in time & date generator. but, most mini cameras don't

            have them and you need one if you want the time & date shown

            on the monitor. time lapse vcr usually has built-in time/date generator. 


do

                    i need motion detection? alarms?  

            in many cases, the motion sensors are possible to connect to existing

            cctv systems however they are difficult to sight correctly. however,

            in digital video recording systems, where the motion detectable area

            can be assigned with software using a computer monitor, motion detection

            is simple and easy. 


do

                    i need pan, tilt and/or zoom control?  

            pan, tilt and zoom functionality is required in special circumstances

            and is generally expensive. there are however some systems with built

            in  ptz which is easy to install, maintain and control. 


do

                      i need to record the pictures? 

            on conventional time lapse vcr or dvr (digital video recorder)?  

            conventional 
 time

            lapse vcr, even though inconvenient to review the recorded pictures,

            is surely economical than dvr (digital

            video recorder). dvr is getting more and more popular for its convenience

            and picture quality. (standard home vcrs are not good to run 24 hours

            a day and some are only for play, not being able to record.) 

   


do

                      i need computer based observation system?  

            with a video capture card which converts analog signals to digital

            ones, you can connect any cctv video camera to the computer if it

            has enough capacity to handle the video files. the more common method

            is to use 
 web

            cameras which run fast over the internet or intranet (lan

            or wan) with small file sizes. many so-called "pc cameras" uses

            c-mos chip instead of ccd chip and also requires separate software.
