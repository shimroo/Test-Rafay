for over a decade i have been committed to what my pastor called ministry of helps in his ministration in 1997 and also prophecised the internet revolution that same year and his prophecy has come to pass. and i am one of the most popular nigerians¬† blogging about nigeria and the rest of the world. i love nigeria and committed to the nation building of a new nigeria in the leadership of africa among the comity of nations. i have spent millions of naira for the advocacy for the education of the millions of underprivileged girls out of school in nigeria since 2013 and i have gone as far as paying human traffickers to release a secondary school girl trafficked to libya in 2016 and she returned to benin in edo state. i spent hundreds of thousands of naira for her rehabilitation. widows and other needy people have received as much as i can give. since the 2019 covid-19 pandemic, incomes from my social media channels have been reduced and compelled me to borrow to make ends meet and cont...

#sundayexaltationsüëèüíïüíãüíûüôå hallelujah! happy sunday, happy new week and happy new month of progress, prosperity, success, triumph and victory of triumphant overcomers and victorious champions of our one and only almighty father god jehovah jireh. happy 63rd independence day of nigara and 60th anniversary of¬† republic of nigara. psalm 34 1 i will bless the lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 2 my soul shall make her boast in the lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.¬† 3 o magnify the lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. 4 i sought the lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. 5 they looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. 6 this poor man cried, and the lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. 7 the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 8 o taste and see that the lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him. 9 o f...

august 07, 2023











    get books on awolowo and nigerian political leaders   chief obafemi awolowo: the political moses is a story of a man who dedicated the entirety of his life to serve humanity and the development of mankind. the author makes use of the noun moses to depict the tiresome journey of an activist who fought rigorously alongside others to gain independence for his people. the fact that his ambition to be president of nigeria was foiled is in itself a matter of discussion transcending the nigerian political debate till now. as late chief odumegwu ojukwu once said awolowo, the best president nigeria never had. the book investigates the celebrated treasonable felony of 1962; bringing into focus the case hearings and the political unrest of the period, party system and political parties in nigeria, nigeria electoral processes from pre-colonial era to the fourth republic, review of political prisoners around the world, and making succinct recommendations for nigeria electoral processes. chief o...

  i am ekenyerengozi michael chima, publisher/editor of nigerian times blog. being a self-employed writer and human rights advocate fighting against corruption and violation of human has been challenging and often traumatic in nigeria.¬† i am also known as the champion of the education of the millions of underprivileged girls out of school in nigeria and developing saas applications for wealth creation and distribution for th e reduction of poverty among the majority of nigerians for the nation building of a new nigeria in the leadership of africa among the comity of nations. fighting corruption in nigeria is suicidal, because of the institutionalization of corruption in the society from the street to the corridors of power in the government. and majority of nigerians don't fight or protest against corruption if the corrupt government shares the loot with them even when only the crumbs of the national cake are left for them in what they call "you chop i chop" government. m...
