forums
forums for discussing art, photography and other topics of general interest

it seems that discussion forums are 'old hat' these days and forums-based websites are considered, by many, to be a relic from the age or the dinasours!! no matter... artfreaks.com was originally - (in the first decade of the 21st century, by the way!) a forums-based website - with a gallery tagged-on for good measure. now, with the articles, blogs and downloads areas of the site, artfreaks.com is so much more than that - but the forums are staying. some people still like them... if you don't, then please do feel quite free to ignore them completely!

								and they keep slipping in little things here and there to almost make you use their flippin cloud services ai and all the rest of that bullshit!
 


	not so long ago, we used to opt in or decide to subscribe to extra functionality. if we wanted it.
 


	now? you almost have to fight your way out if it!
 


	 
 


	i tried deleting microsoft edge and onedrive altogether - just to save me from having to disable these programs from automatically starting up, every time i rebooted my laptop. then my windows wouldn't work until the laptop had gone through all it's "undo changes" - and all the rest of that routine.
 


	i was quite busy that day... 'just as well i had another machine up and running at the time, so i could get on with some work!
 


	 
 


	talking of which...

								microsoft are a pain in the arse, the way they keep changing everything, just for the sake of change. no useful improvements - just unnecessary changes to make it look like they are doing something for their money.
 


	 
 


	if it ain't broke - don't fix it!!
 


	 
 


	microsoft word... the version i had up to a few days ago was absolutely fine...
 


	then here comes another one of their endless updates - and now i have to look around all over the place - just to perform the simple, routine tasks that were second nature to me - until the other day!
