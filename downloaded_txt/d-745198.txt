blood types needed
many variables can impact our blood inventories such as weather, holidays or tragic events.  every day, patients who need blood are in crisis and you can help by volunteering to donate.  less than 10% of the population gives blood, so donors that give on a regular basis are important to meet these needs. book an appointment today!
