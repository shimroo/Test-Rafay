quang ho, paintervietnamese-american, b. 1963



quang ho is more interested in representing the mundane details of his immediate environment than in searching the world for preconceived artistic content. his diverse subject matter ranges from still lifes, landscapes, and interiors, to dancers and figures. “realism and abstract—it’s all the same to me,” he has said. “the real essence of painting is the dialogue between shapes, tones, colors, textures, edges, and line. everything else follows—including light, form, concepts, personal beliefs, and inspirations.” working primarily in oils, watercolors, and pastels, ho is not tethered to any particular mode of expression; a single painting may be a color study, another a formal arrangement, and yet another an exploration of texture and surface.
