sometimes we get weary, and we need a place apart, where careful little stitches delight a tired heart. a place where we can slow down, and just take time to look, like turning favorite pages in a well-loved childhood book. so each and every time you're here, you'll see that it is true, no matter where you come from, this haven's just for you.     - michelle rietz, author
