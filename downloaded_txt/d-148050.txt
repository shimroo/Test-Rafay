indigenous







































































                                      cultures 


each indigenous
                                    culture is distinct and unique.
                                    while many peoples may express
                                    similar worldviews and a common
                                    indigenous identity, their cultures
                                    are nonetheless based on different
                                    histories, environments, and
                                    creative spirits.


the universal
declaration







































































                                      of human rights affirms the
                                    inherent dignity, equality, and
                                    inalienable rights of all members of
                                    the human family. the rights of all
                                    members of indigenous populations
                                    are included in this declaration.
                                    however, indigenous peoples also
                                    have rights as distinct cultural
                                    groups or nations.
 
indigenous
                                      people are people defined in
                                      international or national
                                      legislation as having a set of
                                      specific rights based on their
                                      historical ties to a particular
                                      territory, and their cultural or
                                      historical distinctiveness from
                                      other populations that are often
                                      politically dominant. the
                                      concept of indigenous people
                                      defines these groups as
                                      particularly vulnerable to
                                      exploitation, marginalization and
                                      oppression by nation states that
                                      may still be formed from the
                                      colonising populations, or by
                                      politically dominant ethnic
                                      groups. as a result, a special set
                                      of political rights in accordance
                                      with international law have been
                                      set forth by international
                                      organizations such as the united
                                      nations, the international
                                        labour organization and
                                      the world bank.

                                        declaration on the rights of
                                        indigenous peoples to
                                      guide member-state national
                                      policies to collective rights of

                                      education, and natural resources.
                                      although no definitive definition
                                      of "indigenous peoples" exists,
                                      estimates put the total population
                                      of post-colonial indigenous

                                      million to 350 million.

"in the world of the
                                      powerful there is no space for
                                      anyone but  themselves and
                                      their servants. in our world
                                      everyone has a place. only those
                                      who give up their history are
                                      consigned to oblivion. on the
                                      vacant ground of today, there will
                                      grow a flower of tomorrow."
mankind 'is'
                                        the product of his ancestors."

                                              inspiration


"mankind must
                                            be a steward of the earth -
                                            caretakers for all that
                                            dwells upon it."
 
"whenever we
                                            walk on the earth,
                                            we should pay attention to
                                            what is going on. too often
                                            our minds are somewhere
                                            else, thinking about the
                                            past or thinking about the
                                            future. when we do this, we
                                            are missing important
                                            lessons. the earth is a
                                            constant flow of lessons and
                                            learnings which also include
                                            a constant flow of positive
                                            feelings. if we are aware as
                                            we walk, we will gather
                                            words for our lives, the
                                            lessons to help our
                                            children; we will gather
                                            feelings of
                                            interconnectedness and
                                            calmness. when we experience
                                            this, we should say or think
                                            thoughts of gratitude. when
                                            we do this, the next person
                                            to walk on the sacred path
                                            will benefit even more."
 
"humankind has
                                            not woven the web of life.
                                            we are but one thread within
                                            it. whatever we do to the
                                            web, we do to ourselves. all
                                            things are bound together.
                                            all things connect."

                                            enrich their minds are those
                                            who keep their history on
                                            the leaves of memory. not to
                                            be aware of the past is to
                                            be eternally a child, but
                                            for those of us who forget
                                            the past will be condemned

                                                however, there are basic
                                                principles that all

                                                because of them that our
                                                economies and our
                                                societies are equitable,

                                                      i will share the
                                                      seven directions
                                                    as i was taught when
                                                    i was young. though
                                                    some tribes use
                                                    different colors to
                                                    mark the cardinal
                                                    points and different

                                                    good example is the
                                                    cherokee who use
                                                    blue to designate
                                                    the west instead of
                                                    black. probably
                                                    because they were
                                                    the only tribe i
                                                    know of that owned
                                                    slaves and thus see
                                                    black as a danger be

                                      peoples
 indigenous
                                    peoples are a significant and
                                    important portion of humanity. their
                                    heritage, their ways of life, their
                                    stewardship of this planet, and
                                    their cosmological insights are an
                                    invaluable treasure house for us
                                    all.

                                    the word indigenous has many
                                    meanings. in every region of the
                                    world, many different cultural
                                    groups live together and interact,
                                    but not all of these groups are
                                    considered indigenous or inherent to
                                    their particular geographic area. in
                                    fact, it is only in the face of a
                                    collective or shared sense of
                                    identity that the term indigenous
                                    peoples has been internationally
                                    recognized.

                                    indigenous peoples live in every
                                    region of the world. they live in
                                    climat s ranging from arctic cold to
                                    amazon heat, and often claim a deep
                                    connection to their lands and
                                    natural environments. for many
                                    indigenous peoples, the natural
                                    world is a valued source of food,
                                    health, spirituality and identity.
                                    land is both a critical resource
                                    that sustains life and a major cause
                                    of struggle and even death.

                                    stories
our stories were us, what we knew,
                                  where we came from and where we were
                                  going. they were told to remind of us
                                  of our responsibility, to instruct,
                                  and to entertain. there were 
                                    stories of the creation, our
                                  travels, our laws. there were legends
                                  of hard-fought battles, funny
                                  anecdotes - some from the smokehouse,
                                  some from the trickster - and there
                                  were scary stories to remind us of

the poets of the indigenous







































































                                    america have assumed principal
                                  roles in oratory while defining
                                  present and presence; contemporarily
                                  interpreting value and condition; and
                                  performing intellectual reasoning
                                  which may very well present necessary
                                  prophesies of solution for our world.
                                  it is in these voices the culture
                                  resonates and is shared freely, and in
                                  these voices are indicators of deeper
                                  realms in actual presence within
                                  places of origin now often inhabited
                                  by representatives of nearly all
                                  peoples of the global planet. whereas
                                  inclusions are also present of
                                  indigenous american poetsâ ventures to
                                  outside regions and continents as
                                  well.

 
indigenous







































































                                    nations
indigenous peoples are the
                                  descendants of the original habitants
                                  of a region prior to colonization.
                                  these groups have maintained some or
                                  all of their linguistic, cultural and
                                  organizational characteristics and
                                  consider themselves distinct from the
                                  societies currently governing those
                                  territories. throughout the world,
                                  indigenous peoples have struggled to
                                  co-exist with immigrant peoples who
                                  have established settlements in their
                                  territories. history reflects that in
                                  many instances, non-indigenous peoples
                                  (settler populations and their
                                  governments) have not adequately
                                  respected or supported the sovereignty
                                  or cultural values of indigenous
                                  peoples, which has threatened the
                                  survival of these groups.
