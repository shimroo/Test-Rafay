fig



gioia



























this is fig (figaro) howard, road ready for a visit in the fig rig (a furry friends purple stroller to the rest of the world). he’s turned out to be a better furry friend than anyone could have anticipated. he does four engagements a month, including a visit to the forum, two reading buddies events, and a visit to the ronald mcdonald house. if someone will pet him, he can pup up onto the edge of his stroller and is happy to respond. when he’s not out on assigment, he’s an olympic-level snoozer, a big nosher, and curious about everyone he meets. he greets the guests who visit his home, and has been known to come out to peet’s or starbucks for coffee with friends. fig really loves being a furry friend.



gioia (joya) is a 4 year old cavapoo and has been in furry friends for 3 years.  her teams are the los altos library, los altos terraces, stanford ronald mcdonald house, and kipp prize academy in san jose, where she gets to play fetch and run off leash with special needs children.  she is exhausted afterwards and sometimes naps when kids read to her at the library.  other days we do dog agility at half moon bay dog sports and play frisbee at the beach.  gioia's best friend hazel is an accomplished pet therapy dog and we love to do special visits together.  gioia has earned the akc canine good citizen title, along with the advanced trick dog & therapy dog titles.  it sure is fun learning new things together.
