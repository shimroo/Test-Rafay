the meru project is
      based on 40 years of research by
      stan tenen into the origin and
      nature of the hebrew alphabet, and
      the mathematical structure
      underlying the sequence of letters
      of the hebrew text of genesis. the
      project is sponsored by the meru
      foundation, registered california
      501(c)(3) private nonprofit research
      and educational corporation founded
      in 1983. 
 from the introductory text:
"the meru project has discovered an extraordinary and unexpected geometric metaphor in the letter-sequence of the hebrew text of genesis that underlies and is held in common by the spiritual traditions of the ancient world. this metaphor models embryonic growth and self-organization. it applies to all whole systems, including those as seemingly diverse as meditational practices and the mathematics fundamental to physics and cosmology...meru project findings demonstrate that the relationship between physical theory and consciousness, expressed in explicit geometric metaphor, was understood and developed several thousand years ago."

announcement:


we  regret the passing of stan tenen in early 2022.
                                  those  of us who worked with stan over the years are dedicated
                                  to  disseminating his work and building on his research.
                                  we  welcome advocates and contributions to this cause.

                                        text of genesis, stan tenen has
                                        created the beginnings of a
                                        wonderful geometric language -
                                        using real and deep mathematical
                                        structures. the language is a
                                        new alphabet, an alphabet of
                                        geometric forms that may solve
                                        the riddle of genesis. the
                                        geometric alphabet is itself not
                                        only of great artistic and
                                        conceptual value, but i believe
                                        that it will be seen to hold a

                                      our work is ongoing, and our
                                      resources are limited.
                                      if you like what you see, and
                                      would like to see more of it, we
                                      need your help.

                                      we need funding, but we also need
