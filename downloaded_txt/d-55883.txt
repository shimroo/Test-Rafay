action alert, palestine, discrimination and profil





safeguard free speech by protecting our democracy



action alert, palestine, discrimination and profil




the countering antisemitism act (caa) poses just as much of a threat as the antisemitism awareness act (aaa) to free speech as they both conflate legitimate criticism of israel or zionism with antisemitism. this conflation, if passed into law, would lead to government overreach and censorship, stifling political discourse and academic freedom.

don’t scapegoat arab americans 



feb 10, 2025




there’s an insidious blame game occurring on social media. whenever president donald trump takes one of his outrageous actions, arab americans are subjected to a flood of abusive messages.

what trump’s threat to clean out gaza means 



feb 3, 2025




president donald trump’s “shock and awe” assault on virtually every major institution in washington has been, to a degree, successful. there’s a perverse logic behind his radical cabinet appointments, widespread firings and threats to the federal workforce, and his seemingly scattershot executive orders that upset apple-carts up and down the street.

can this israeli-palestinian ceasefire bring peace? 



jan 27, 2025




there are two realities that must be confronted in any consideration of “what’s next for gaza?” the first is that it would be naïve and risky to put too much faith in this current ceasefire. the second is that failing to understand the true human toll of this war is dangerously insensitive—it’s far greater than the tens of thousands of palestinians who have been killed and/or severely wounded by israeli forces.

an arab american assessment of biden's failures



jan 20, 2025




as joseph biden’s presidency comes to an end, his national security advisor, secretary of state, and now biden himself have been making an effort to put a pretty face on their disastrous performance in the middle east.

foreign manipulation of the arab east must end 



jan 6, 2025




there’s no two ways about it, the arab east is a mess. it is weak, divided, directionless, locked in multiple conflicts, and not in control of its own destiny. this isn’t new. it’s been this way for a century, with non-arab powers preying off the region in pursuit of their own aspirations.

the debate on israel/palestine is changing, but we’re not there yet 



dec 30, 2024




this afternoon, i went for a walk and noticed that a homeowner had recently placed a sign on their front lawn. it simply read “i stand with israel.” if this had been 400 or so days ago, i would have thought nothing of it. back then, supporters of israel were still reeling from the shock of the october 7th attack and felt a need to express themselves.

a perfect christmas message: the manger covered with a keffiyeh 



dec 23, 2024




the scene at the paul vi chapel in the vatican’s st peter’s square was quite moving. pope francis had come to thank those who had donated the chapel’s christmas tree and the carved life-sized figures that depicted the birth of jesus that had been set up at the foot of the tree.

need to remember: palestinians in gaza are still suffering 



dec 9, 2024




it’s disturbing how the us news media flits from story to story, seemingly incapable of sustaining attention on events that require it. the nightmare of gaza which received in-depth treatment for over a year has now faded from view eclipsed by other dramatic developments in the arab east.

i’m skeptical about the israel/lebanon peace deal 



dec 2, 2024




this past week, israeli, lebanese, and us leaders were busy patting themselves on the back announcing the completion of an israeli/lebanese ceasefire agreement.

biden’s legacy: complicity in israel’s gaza war 



nov 25, 2024




history will not be kind to the presidency of joseph biden when it evaluates his administration’s handling of israel’s genocidal war on gaza. at best, his response will be judged weak and feckless. at worst, he will be seen as enabling of or even complicitous in the crimes committed.

the gaza war won’t end by imposing a “solution” on palestinians
