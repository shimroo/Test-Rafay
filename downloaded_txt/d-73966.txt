testimonials

what our clients say








kelly r."great dumpster rental company. you call, and a real person answers, they tell you when they will deliver, and then they do exactly as they say. when they arrived they put nice thick boards under the dumpster wheels to prevent any damage to our drive way , which is the first time i have ever seen anyone do that… and i greatly appreciate it. when it was time for it to be picked up i called, again got a real person and they came as promised on the day and time we agreed upon. the entire experience is how i would expect a dumpster rental to go down, but they are he exception, as we have done this 5 times now and cl noonan was the first one to get it right. they have good pricing – pretty standard, but it is their great customer service that makes them stand out. 5 stars all the way, i wish i had found them sooner."

sandy l."we had a challenging job on our hands that we had to act on fast to clean up, called our regular container company who did not come through for us..while the clock was ticking on what we knew was already going to be a lengthy glass clean up (30,000 lbs) of shattered glass to be precise- i reached out to cl noonan containers for help, thinking all the while “there not going to help us were not a regular customer of theirs “ ..well did i ever get a pleasant surprise, this wonderful, professional lady who said her name was megan ladetto happened to pick up that phone and took care of setting our company up with a container large enough to handle the job. megan thank you for going above and beyond, your a sweetheart your professionalism and kindness means so much to me. our heartfetl thanks to megan & cl noonan for their assistance."
