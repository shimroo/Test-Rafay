make you own: foot scrub





what you need:

8 strawberries
2 tablespoons of olive or safflower oil
1 teaspoon of kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon of almonds, finely chopped

how to make it: 

mix and blend all the ingredients together to form a paste. don't over blend. the strawberries have a lot of water in them and too much blending makes for a 'watery' paste. massage it onto your feet, rinse off and dry your feet. be careful with your massaging here because you don't want to grind almond bits into your skin. you can refrigerate any mixture that is leftover. shelf life is about a week.

designer line: jimmy choo for uggs






your eyes do not decieve you!﻿ there is a pair of ugg boots that might tempt you more than the average. too bad the price tag is absolutely astronomical... jimmy choo or not no pair of fluffy sheepskin boots is worth $795.00 but, if you are still interested you can purchase them here.

retail therapy!






wish you could score a hot new bag! i'm always trying to find a way... pop sugar is giving away the real deal, seven different designer handbags, each one better than the last in popsugar's retail therapy's first ever contest! think balenciaga, chanel, alexander wang! to enter, head over to popsugar's retail therapy game on facebook, click the "enter now" button in the top banner and fill out the form that pops up. each bag is unlocked based on the number of people playing popsugar's retail therapy, they've already given away the first one so everyone else need to get in the game! they've unlocked the next bag and have started again! the best part is, you only need to enter once. the seventh level bag is the holy grail of handbags, the bag of all bags (approximate retail value $10,000)! i'm waiting with bated breath like you... so enter now and tell your friends! the sooner we hit the levels, the sooner we'll unlock the bags! to learn more, read the official rules. good luck!
