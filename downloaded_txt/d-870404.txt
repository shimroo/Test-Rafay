american airlines homophobia


begging for a boycott.


i was on a plane once with a couple of lesbian lovers who were all but making out. it was not exactly embarrassing, more, very distracting, peering through the gap between 6 rows of seat backs to get a good look - and  where do you look when you have eye contact with a girl whose tongue is down her girlfriend's throat. this ocurred on easy jet uk to spain, so i guess the english stewardess would have been to shy to ask them to stop. us businesses are neutered and retarded arent they, in comparison to the rest of the world?


this is really sad, particularly since i've been trying to rack up aa miles lately (by doing anything i can except fly on them -- like charge things).  sounds like the pursar only really got upset when the question "would you treat straight people the same way?" was asked -- oh, those uppity gays!i hope someone stays on top of this until a real explanation is given.


hi, i`m from germany and i wonder me what about telling you?but, it`s interesting to read! see you latertorstenhotel rothenburger hof dresden


it's not unusual nowadays to see such a sceen. people are more relaxed in their actions now and it's not that bad.


aa has a lot of nerve.  when the pilots switch on auto-pilot, they pull out the porn and probably do a little in-flight action with some of the stews.  give me a break.  this is what they worry about after 9/11?  unreal and unacceptable.

hi,i just want to share the information that i have. based on many researches that have been published, most of the research comes with this result;25 to 35 percent of patients with cancer will develop depression.suffering from both a physical and psychological illness makes patients more ill and disabled. however, it has been proven that the signs of depression in cancerous patients may hard to be picked up since it is superimposed by the complication of the cancer itself. what ever it is, what we need to do is to keep giving and show our support to them in order to improve life expectancy and increase the quality of life. we can do it!thank you.

gay or straight nothing wrong with wanting to join the mile high club, airlines should make the loos bigger so people dont have to do it in public.


begging for a boycott.


is not nothin much to say about this page. i think a very successful and useful.


sorry to hear they treated you guys like garbage.  it's looking like they treat all their customers like garbage, and expect to "corporate fancy talk" their way out of it.i am posting this response on every blog i can find to get the word out.  don't waste your money on american airlines.i wish i had found this blog before my trip last week.  i would not have bothered with these american airlines ***holes.my suitcase was broken into and some of my tools were stolen while my bag was in posession of their company.  i was on a business trip and really needed them.the lock was cut, but hung back through the loops so it appeared to be intact when i glanced at at after pulling my bag off the carousel.what did i get from aa? a sappy letter full of meaningless niceties and hollow, canned platitudes telling me that i should have reported the loss within 24 hours.gee thanks, for nothing you jerks.in the past, i just wore my pocket tool and swiss army knife on my belt and they were never stolen.  i also never hijacked a plane with them either.but now that everyone is treated like a terrorist... we have to check our personal property ...and trust that these clueless corporate jerks are competent enough to hire honest employees.obviously, they don't deserve my trust or my company's money.i don't care who you fly with folks, but do not fly with american airlines.

i agree with your four categories that are important for the next generation of the internet. however, regarding your definition of what open standards are, i am missing bu sitede en saglam pornolar izlenir.the most important attribute, that of being open to anyone that wishes to actively participate without the approval by those responsible for the administrative and/or operational side of the development process. sadly not to many standards activities labeled open today are truly open.

in school, students very rarely get to experience life. when the students get enrolled in college, they are first of all away from their families, so this makes them independent, and thus, they learn how to be on their own. during the college years, if the students have the right attitude, i.e., they really want to learn and study, the scope for it is unlimited. write essay

clones are not the same


do you think this is just an issue of poorly understood science, or do you think there might be various odd religious ideas afoot as well?  at least in the human case, there seem to be people that are using the genome as a physical proxy for supernatural ideas like souls.  i hear anti-abortionists emphasizing the genetic uniqueness a new embryo.  they bring this up both in attacks on abortion and on embryo using research.  they seem to think that this accords the embryo some special status, but they never explain why being different is worth anything.  my suspicion is what they are really thinking is that it now has its own unique soul.  i don’t know if that is really what they are up to since they don’t make that claim.  perhaps they realize that it is an unsupportable opinion that they have no argument for.in the case of christians at least, they probably don’t believe critters like mules have “souls”.  but maybe they believe in a related supernatural essence for these other animals.  if so, they would be inclined to believe that two mules with the same genes would have to have the same essence.your thoughts?


yes, i've heard this weird argument as well. they seem not to realize that in fact even the genome is not defined at the moment of conception. immune cells undergo permanent rearrangements of the genome in order to create antibody diversity. then there's the "epigenome" of methylation, histone modifications, etc. that even begin to differ between identical twins. plus obviously the subject of this post, identical twins (as if twins each have half a soul or something?). i think that's just anti-abortion people trying to give a bit of scientific patina to the argument that a soul is infused at the moment of conception (which is itself not a moment, as it takes a few hours for the sperm and egg to fuse their nuclei).and, yes it is poorly understood science, but poorly understood for deeper reasons, even more general than specific religious ideas. i think people have deep-seated intuitions that living things have hidden essences, which is probably how the whole idea of souls got started in the first place.* so even people who aren't really religious are vulnerable to this misunderstanding, since the genome is such a convenient representation of this hidden essence. the reality, that your personal identity is a complicated combination of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, neural firing patterns, and synaptic connections, isn't as appealing or intuitive.*i remember reading about a study where children were asked what would happen if you "modified" animals or objects. if you showed them a hammer and said you were going to take off the metal part and whittle the wood into a sculpture, they would say it wasn't a hammer anymore, but a sculpture. but if you took a dog and replaced all its dog parts with cat parts, the kids were convinced that even though it looked like a cat, it was still "really" a dog - i.e. it retained its dog essence.


that study with the animal essences sounds really interesting.  if i did such research, i would want to push into less people like animals.  snakes? worms?we also have a problem with whether people are really the “same” in an appropriate sense their whole lives.  for instance, does it make sense to prosecute a ninety-year-old man for war crimes committed when he was an ardent young nazi living in a very different world?  hard to get traction on a question like that, so maybe we just let simplified ideas of the genome and the like do the extra work.


this may not apply directly to war crimes cases, but in general there is a deterrence rationale for prosecuting even reformed criminals (e.g., murder unsolved for 30 years is finally solved due to dna evidence, but the murderer repented 20 years ago and became a priest) - you should be equally deterred by the threat of someday going to jail whether or not you have undergone a drastic personality change before getting caught. for the "elderly nazi" case, i'm persuaded by mark kleiman's argument that retributive justice has value in that it restores the social status of the victims of the war crimes, by affirming that they are worth avenging. [which would justify punishing the elderly nazi where incapacitation and deterrence would not.]in a way, there are already legal means of exculpation on the grounds that you weren't "the same person" when you committed the crime - e.g. temporary insanity. of course this is more specific - you have to show that at the time of the crime you didn't know that what you were doing was wrong.


yes, kleiman’s argument seems reasonable and puts the individual case into a larger social framework which certainly seems to be the right way to look at genocide.  but i don’t buy the deterrence argument for general crime at all.  people discount their futures, and 20 or 30 years out, that discount will be steep.  i would guess that the effect of such deterrence would be so slight that it would be drowned out in the noise of any attempt to ever measure it.


true, a 20-30 year discount is pretty steep. that might be part of the reason why we have a statute of limitations on many crimes. but i think a "character change" basis for clemency does undermine deterrence at shorter timespans. i mean, what if you believed you could get off scot-free for murder if, for example, you spend two months at a drug rehab center and afterwards are no longer the "same" person who committed the crime? after all, drastic character changes are correlated with the passage of time, but some people do have drastic character changes in short periods of time while others remain essentially the same over their entire lives.


it is better to try cloning with animals..its all good.. funny watching animals like that...but its better not to try with human-beings.there are some talks like some of the scientists already start experimenting with human beings..aa breakdown cover


i consider the idea of cloning people awful. i think no one will be happy to see a person looking and behaving the way he is doing. the twins is quite another thing.


people discount their futures, and 20 or 30 years out, that discount will be steep. i would guess that the effect of such deterrence would be so slight that it would be drowned out in the noise of any attempt to ever measure it.


and 20 or 30 years out, that discount will be steep. i would guess that the effect of such deterrence would be so slight that it would be drowned out in the noise of any attempt to ever measure it.

hi,i'm not surprised if people still misunderstand this. you know what, our prime minister here in m******a (too shy to mention) even said that dna can be expired (in his answer upon the need of taking another dna sample from our late deputy prime minister, when the dna sample that has been taken from him last 10 years is still there with the police). so what? lol.by,the littmann lightweight ii se stethoscope team


it is nice review.cheers,perniagaan internet | rahsia internet | cari duit diinternet | pemasaran internet | cari duit online


it's somewhat irritating seeing yourself not in a mirror but with another person. an identical twin only the same with physical features, but different in attitude. a clone looks and act the same as you, as it refers to process of duplicating something that already exist. cloning have been done for decades, though mostly are through plants and animals. never seen one though. casablanca ceiling fans

four reasons why brahms is my favorite composer


i'm not familiar with the piano concertos, but if you love those other moments, you need to listen to the string quartets -- especially the viola part in the 2nd (or is it the 3rd) movement of the the third string quartet.


i love the string quartets! in fact one bit that i left off the list was the slow movement of the c minor quartet. absolutely beautiful.

okay, okay, i know the symbology of the cross represents jesus, not the romans, but still, i find the whole story of the crucifixion and its centrality to christianity ("and he did all that for you!") rather disturbing.


when the romans first introduced crucifixion, they probably were pleased that they had come up with a cheap and easy way to terrorize their opponents with dramatic mass executions.  once the cross became such a potent symbol, you wonder if they regretted not using something like drowning.  i doubt that a death cult would have gained as much traction if the principle had been drowned instead.  but who knows?

random question of the day


because the italians still like spaghetti westerns?


for dramatic effect.  it's an election poster for the democratic left


as an italian i can say that it's a quotation from western. moreover italians have a really incredible worship for english language, considered that most of them cannot really speak it...


it is a universal sign - it means the same thing in every language, just like 'wc' on a door anywhere in the world tells you what kind of room is behind it.


aha, that clears it up - thanks for the explanation, everyone!


that's right--we are just so smart.  so what else do you need to know?


i thought it was another sign of anglo-american hegemony.  (now i sound smart!)


maybe it´s also because of the many tourist visiting italy everyday?regchrismy photocommunity

i originally  buy viagra  from my doctor when i went in for a physical that my work required. he gave me cheap viagra  sample pack that had six pills. i tried to buy viagra  before without any luck. the next night (friday) i got really hard in about 20 minutes. i took a shower before we went to bed and basically had a hard on the whole time. i was able to flex my penis harder than normal. when i got out of the shower i came into bed, still with a rock hard  erection- when my wife saw me at full attention, she asked "what got into you!?" i did not tell her i had purchase viagra  pill, but that i was just super horny. we had a very good sex session- she had an orgasm, and i was able to keep it up during "reverse cowgirl", which is her favorite sex position. last weekend while we were playing around, she even took a picture of erections to show her girlfriends at work! at first i told her "no way".i am not sure yet if i am going to use viagra alternative  like cialis online  or to buy cialis online  since i have never try to use internet for buying drugs.my friend told me i can buy cialis someplace buy i am not sure if it is safe, also i never used cialis before, i think i will purchase viagra since prices are cheaper , so maybe it is better to use online pharmacy to buy viagra then to buy cialis online, doctor gave me various samples to choose from:  generic cialis ,  viagra online, generic viagra  , brand versions of them. i liked brand viagra the most. now my sexual life is as good as ever, whenever i know i’m going to get laid, i pop the blue pill in my mouth an hour before the act. brand viagra literally saved my sexual life.

buying viagra and avoiding online scams : the following information from pfizer is provided as a guide and warning to potential consumers who seek to buy viagra online: avoiding pharmacy scams will help you save a lot of time and money as well as frustration. many so called online pharmacies sell dangerous fake versions of viagra that are not only illegal but may be harmful to your health.

i think this is great that we have a lot of online pharmacy no prescription. cause it is easier to save money with them. for example, i want to buy viagra online or buy cialis online or buy levitra online, then i just go to my favorite online canadian pharmacy and get generic levitra. i choose it because this medicine works fine for me. my friend had some problems with health, his doctor prescribed him some antibiotics, so he spent about one thousand dollars!!!! if he knew about that pharmacies, he could save a lot of money and no physician needed.


nice post and nice blog! keep it on dude!

very useful story i will add this blog, well done my friend.


the result would be a cacophony of superstitions — memes vying with memes — some more likely to proliferate than others. in a world where agriculture was drawing people to aggregate in larger and larger settlements, it would be beneficial to believe you had been commanded by a stern god to honor and protect your neighbors, those who share your beliefs instead of your dna. casting this god as a father figure also seems like a natural. parents have a genetic stake in giving their children advice that improves their odds for survival. you’d have less reason to put your trust in a flying spaghetti monster. at first this winnowing of ghost promotional items stories would be unconscious, but as language and self-awareness developed, some ideas would be groomed and domesticated.

erectile dysfunction faq'simpotence, or penile erectile dysfunction, in men is not as rare as one would think it is.in fact, one out of ten men around the world is affected by this condition. it is not exclusive to old men either. impotence is caused not just by physical factors,but mental factors as well.exercising on a regular basis and eating healthy food will increase your ability to sustain prolonged physical effort and we all know that sex is effort.smoking, frequently drinking large quantities of alcohol, taking recreational drugs and lack of exercising will sap your stamina and also slow down the flow of blood.penis exercises can be used for maintaining fitness, preventing or controlling premature ejaculation and increasing the length and girth of the penis.by penis enlargement pills you can overcome these problems and not only that you can also enlarge, extend also to strengthen your penis and premature ejaculation will not exist anymore for you.visit http://www.factspenisenlargement.com for more info.

this is a rather unsettling post about what is going on in china. i'd like to think the society is becoming more open but i can see they still have a long way to go.


i'm reading this post several years after it was written, and i think the author would be amazed to look at the china of 2011 and the china he wrote about in 2006. since then capitalism has taken off, china has hosted olympics, and china has become an economic forced to be reckoned with.

natural selection still happening in humans


hi andrew.i'd welcome your thoughts on this evidence that lamarkian-style effects occur in evolution.


thanksss


animal natural selection, the smartest most fit  most well adapted animals are the ones who reproduce and shape their species. in humans the poorest, least well adapted, most unintellegent are the ones who produce the most offspring and shape the race. any comments on this?


i agree with anonymous.  it seems the stupid humans that shouldn't be spreading their genes are the ones that are reproducing.  this means the human race is devolving and becoming weaker and stupider.what also confuses me is we're the only species that doesn't let natural selection and survival of the fittest do its job.  when i read about stupid people doing stupid things and dying as a result, people say things like "we need to educate others, so they don't die too".  no! we shouldn't stop others from doing it too, it's called natural selection and it's thinning the herd and getting rid of the stupid ones.best example, i was watching a show and parents were talking about how their children had killed themselves playing the hanging game or something like that.  so!  their child was an idiot and nature decided to step in and do its job.  your child was an idiot and probably would have killed a smart person because of their ignorance.  when something like this happens, we should instead say “thank goodness that idiot killed themselves and not a smart person”.thanks for letting me rant

dennett on religion


it also sounds like a slightly more cynical twist on cassirer's language and myth, with his "momentary gods." i assume cassirer had read hume, of course.


this kind of speculation might be amusing, but it always seems to fall into the “sounds good to me” style of argumentation.  and if somebody else says it doesn’t sound good to them, then that’s the end of it since neither party can point to much by way of evidence.  i’m much more impressed by the kind of argument that paul bloom made in the december “atlantic” that looks instead at what is it about humans that make them so susceptible to religious belief.  at least here there is the hope of real evidence for or against your claim.  and if we can nail this question down with some clarity, it might provide at least broad brackets on how historic religious beliefs and practices were likely to have developed.  i’ll probably read dennett’s book, but i’m not expecting it to be one of his better efforts.


i also agree with bloom that religious belief might not have had any adaptive advantage in itself but is, perhaps, merely the by-product of other things that did.  he quite rightly points out that there are many near universal characteristics of humans that do not have such advantage--say, masturbation.


speaking of ideas that dennett may or may not have gotten from hume, his attack on the cartesian theatre sounds a lot like hume's idea that "the mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, repass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations. there is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different, whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity. the comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. they are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant notion of the place where these scenes are represented, or of the materials of which it is composed."steven pinker has a "non-adaptive by-product" explanation of religion along the lines of what bloom describes, as a combination side effect of 1) theory of mind [which causes us to overextend theory of mind to see intention in nature] and 2) trust of experts [adaptive because no one can know everything, so it's good to trust the group's herbal expert, but this makes us susceptible to religious preaching].


i've never read pinker; maybe i should take a look.  one of the most interesting bits of bloom's argument is that the key piece is more basic than an overextended theory of mind causing us to see intention in nature.  before that  the theory of mind causes us to see mind and body as distinct.  who hasn't imagined being "transported" into somebody elses body?  we can think like that with ease.  from there it is no problem to imagine existing after death or without a body at all.  and then why not have all sorts of thinking, doing creatures that either don't need bodies or do quite nicely with a tree or even the wind?


re pinker - i don't think his explanation of religion is in any of his books (as far as i remember) - i heard it at a talk he gave 2 years ago. maybe it will be in his next book... the divorce of mind and body is a key thing, i think pinker did mention that. maybe he took it from bloom!


hi andrew,have you seen yesterday's (feb. 8) interview of daniel dennett at salon?  i'm tempted to read the new book based on the interview.  i like his description of the "invisible moat around religion," keeping scientists from studying the phenomenon lest they "break the spell."  driftwood is right about bloom's article in the atlantic.  it's quite interesting.  i especially like bloom's descriptions of experiments on babies that show how we form different expectations of the physical and psychological worlds very early.  cool stuff.


hmm, since i don't want to turn cookies on just so i can watch an ad from salon, could you fill in a bit what dennett said?i rather enjoyed dennett's earlier work but he seems to have slipped into a bait-and-swap style of promising a lot more than he even tries to deliver.  so my fear is that his book will be padded out with a lot of armchair speculating that might be interesting and might even be possible, but will be a long way off from probable.  but, as i said, i will probably read the book since i have been growing more interested in the subject of late.


hi driftwood,i bought dennett's book yesterday.  i have just begun reading it, but i would say that nearly everything in the salon interview is discussed in the first 100 pages of the book.  if you are going to read the book anyway, don't bother with the salon interview.  here are a couple of answers dennett gave that i thought were interesting:  does it worry you that american politics under the current administration have become infused with religion? it does. the separation of church and state is very important and is not as uncontroversial today in the united states as it should be. around the world we see clear cases of how seriously bad theocracies are. so we certainly have to take steps to preserve the secular foundation of this country. i put my faith in secular, free societies and democracies like the united states. you have "faith"? by faith, i don't mean an irrational belief. i've got to leap and secular democracy is the lifeboat i leap to. somebody else may think, "if i have to choose between my religion and country," i choose religion. we're beseeching people in iraq not to do that. but what about at home? it's all right to have an allegiance to a religion, but is your allegiance to democracy and a secular state more important than your allegiance to your religion? if the answer is no, then i don't want you in office. i think that's a pretty reasonable test. dennett is a good writer.  i am finding the book quite engaging so far.  the topic was also handled well by richard dawkins in unweaving the rainbow.-g


ok, cool.yes, i think dawkins writes well too.


i should clarify my last comment.  there is some overlap between unweaving the rainbow and breaking the spell, but rainbow is broader in scope.  spell is an argument for the scientific investigation of religion, whereas rainbow is a defense of scientific inquiry in general.  both emphatically make the point that scientific understanding in no way diminishes the beauty of the natural - or the human - world.  religion may prove an exception.  dennett argues that investigating religion may be critically important, but we don't know because people are afraid to talk about it.  (i'm beginning to think i have hijacked this thread.  enough from me.)

i'm impressed at the way you have covered the facts without missing any of the key points


the book is divided into three parts. part i discusses the motivation and justification for the entire project: can science study religion? should science study religion? after answering in the affirmative, part ii proceeds to use the tools of evolutionary biology and promotional items memetics to suggest possible theories regarding the origin of religion and subsequent evolution of modern religions from ancient folk beliefs. part iii analyzes religion and its effects in today's world: does religion make us moral? is religion what gives meaning to life? what should we teach the children? dennett bases much of his analysis on empirical evidence, though he often points out that much more research in this field is needed.

so, the scene where ennis and jack are reunited after four years and their passion overcomes them and they kiss violently, and alma sees them and turns away in shock. did people find this scene comic? i saw the movie in two different theaters and in both places the audience laughed. though when you think about it, it's actually incredibly tragic. is there something about the way the scene was played that makes it funny? is it just the shock of it?


i don't remember anyone laughing.  i got a horrible tight "oh, no" feeling in my gut when i knew they were going to get caught.  if i had to guess, i'd say that the "oooh, you're gonna get caught" could strike someone as funny, at least for a moment, until the full import of what it meant in the context of the movie struck home.


maybe it was nervous laughter?  no one laughed where i saw it, but i could hear people (including myself) drawing in a breath.  i thought that was a really tense moment.


yea, i guess it must have been nervous laughter...


no it was not nervous laughter, it was simply reaction to the weak point in the plot: it is entirely unbelievable that ennis would kiss in front of his house, let alone in public.


i agree with anonymous. i didn't buy the scene at all.


no, not at all.this movie is about the psychological corrosion of a life lived in the gay closet.  in fact, two actual closets figure at key moments in the film.  read daniel mendelsohn’s excellent review in the feb 23 new york review of books for more on this.in the scene in question here, ennis is not out in the open in front of his house but instead is in a narrow walkway that is closed on three sides.  so the one time in his life when his passion gets the upper hand over his fearful caution, it destroys his wife’s faith in their marriage.  that walkway was not quite a closet since it lacks a door.  even though he eventually all but collapses emotionally, not even ennis can keep himself so closeted that nobody ever sees in.


yea, i have to say i don't think the scene was unbelievable. the whole point is that at that moment their passion - after 4 years - overwhelmed their good sense (though not enough for them to kiss literally in public, only in the walkway). the scene in annie proulx's story, which is slightly different:a hot jolt scalded ennis and he was out on the landing pulling the door closed behind him. jack took the stairs two and two. they seized each other by the shoulders, hugged mightily, squeezing the breath out of each other, saying, son of a bitch, son of a bitch, then, and easily as the right key turns the lock tumblers, their mouths came together, and hard, jack's big teeth bringing blood, his hat falling to the floor, stubble rasping, wet saliva welling, and the door opening and alma looking out for a few seconds at ennis's straining shoulders and shutting the door again and still they clinched, pressing chest and groin and thigh and leg together, treading on each other's toes until they pulled apart to breathe and ennis, not big on endearments, said what he said to his horses and daughters, little darlin.

watch the video. how many of the guys have their shirt open down their chest? how many of the guys are wearing suggestive clothing? this has nothing to do with wearing “comfortable clothing” and everything to do with women showing cleavage. there are a lot of comfortable, loose fitting summer clothes that do not show cleavage. where is the video of the guy walking around with a spedo and his behind half showing — see ifescort anyone looks at that. step back and take some perspective on the differnce between the clothes that women choose to wear and what men choose to wear (and what is acceptable in our society).

	 american airlines homophobia
	 
    


as if the terrible food and movie selection on the last american airlines flight i took weren't enough, along comes this story to make me boycott american airlines. american airlines flight 45 ... assigned to seats 20a and 20b were george tsikhiseli, a television journalist, and his writer boyfriend, stephan varnier. “we’ve been together only four months,” tsikhiseli said last week. “so it felt like a honeymoon.” ...shortly after takeoff, varnier nodded off, leaning his head on tsikhiseli. a stewardess came over to their row. “the purser wants you to stop that,” she said.“i opened my eyes and was, like, ‘stop what?’ ” varnier recalled the other day.“the touching and the kissing,” the stewardess said, before walking away.tsikhiseli and varnier were taken aback. “he would rest his head on my shoulder or the other way around. we’d kiss—not kiss kiss, just mwah,” tsikhiseli recalled, making a smacking sound. ...a little later, the purser appeared at row 20. she was, by all accounts, calm and professional; to the men’s surprise, she said that she knew nothing about the incident and had not instructed the stewardess to tell tsikhiseli and varnier to stop touching each other.“which stewardess was it?” she asked.one of the men pointed out the stewardess—a woman with, as jackson put it, “texas hair, like from the nineteen-sixties.” according to leisner, the purser rolled her eyes and said, “oh, say no more. i know.”the purser asked the men to describe what they’d been doing, and she acknowledged that their behavior had not been inappropriate. tsikhiseli then asked if the stewardess would have made the request if the kissers had been a man and a woman. suddenly, leisner said, the purser “became very rigid.” contradicting what she’d told them before, she stiffly said, “kissing is inappropriate behavior on an airplane.” she then said that she was busy with the meal service and promised to come back.half an hour later, the purser returned, this time saying that some passengers had complained about tsikhiseli and varnier’s behavior earlier. the men asked more questions. ... finally, the purser said that if they didn’t drop the matter the flight would be diverted. ...maybe an hour later, the purser approached tsikhiseli and said that the captain wanted to talk to him. tsikhiseli went up to the galley and gave the captain his business card. the captain told tsikhiseli that if they didn’t stop arguing with the crew he would indeed divert the plane. “i want you to go back to your seat and behave the rest of the flight, and we’ll see you in new york,” he said. tsikhiseli returned to coach.tim wagner, a spokesman for american, said that the stewardess’s injunction to the men was reasonable, and would have been made whether the couple was gay or straight. “our passengers need to recognize that they are in an environment with all ages, backgrounds, creeds, and races. we have an obligation to make as many of them feel as comfortable as possible,” he said. (he added, “our understanding is that the level of affection was more than a quick peck on the cheek.”) but a customer-service representative named terri, reached last week on the telephone, offered the opinion that kissing on airplanes is indeed permissible. “oh, yeah! sure. i’ve seen couples who are on honeymoons,” she said. “they just don’t want you to go into the bathroom together.”

	 clones are not the same
	 
    


today's silly misunderstanding of cloning comes from the new york times: anyone trying to select a winner at the mule races this weekend in winnemucca, nev., will no doubt have a hard time choosing between idaho gem and idaho star. they may have different names, but they are not necessarily different mules.idaho gem and idaho star are clones. they are two of three mules who were born in 2003 as the result of a cloning project at the university of idaho and utah state university. no, no, no! this is like saying "mary-kate and ashley olsen may have different names, but they are not necessarily different people." the two mules, like the olsen twins or any other identical twins, merely share their dna. this doesn't mean they're the same mule. this misunderstanding pops up quite a lot (especially with journalists trying to get a nice "twist" on the story for an eye-catching lead) and it's really quite pernicious as it distorts the debate about reproductive cloning.

	 the musician of state
	 
    


speaking of brahms, condoleeza rice has  astonishingly similar taste in classical music to me. the classical pieces on her list of top ten favorite musical pieces are mozart's d minor piano concerto, brahms' bb major piano concerto, brahms' piano quintet, beethoven's symphony no. 7, and mussorgsky's boris glazunov. i don't know the mussorgsky opera, but the seventh is my favorite beethoven symphony, and as i said in my last post, the two brahms works are my favorite pieces - probably the greatest piano concerto and chamber music piece of all time. like condi, i too want to learn the brahms 2nd piano concerto "before i leave this earth." i might not agree with her politics, but i like her music taste!

	 four reasons why brahms is my favorite composer
	 
    


1. the re-entrance of the theme, played by the solo cello in f# major after the long hushed suspension, two-thirds of the way through the slow movement of the second piano concerto.2. the minor second in the piano after the long solo statement of the second theme in the first movement of the first piano concerto, just before the piano hands off to the winds.3. the soaring soprano at "die mit tränen säen, werden mit freuden ernten" in the first movement of ein deutsches requiem.4. the end of the first movement of the piano quintet.

	 nature red in tooth and claw
	 
    


yet another lovely example of horrifying savagery in the natural world: when douglas w. mock of the university of oklahoma began studying egrets in texas three decades ago, he knew that the bigger babies in a clutch would peck the smaller ones to death. still, dr. mock was caught off guard by what he saw — or failed to see. he had assumed that the murderous attacks would surely take place while mom and dad egret were out fishing. ...instead, dr. mock witnessed utter parental indifference. the mother or father would stand by the side of the nest, doing nothing as one chick battered its sibling bloody. "the parent would yawn or groom itself and look completely blasé," said dr. mock... "in the 3,000 attacks that i witnessed, i never saw a parent try to stop one. it's as though they expect it to happen."one researcher watched a nest of african black eagles for three days as the larger eaglet alternated between tirelessly stabbing at its sibling and taking food from its solicitous mother's mouth. there was prey to spare, but the mother did not bother feeding the second, abused baby. when the eaglet's poor, tattered body was finally tossed to the ground, the researcher calculated that it had been pecked 1,569 times. another reason to hesitate before too eagerly making the analogy between the "positive" results generated by natural selection and by pure, unfettered market forces.ps: it also adds yet more to the "problem of evil" flaw in "intelligent design" - why on earth would god design hatchlings to kill each other by pecking? surely the mother could at least have been designed to slip the unwanted hatchlings a bit of painless poison.

	 blame orwell
	 
    


language log notes yet another example of the "x have no word for y" sapir-whorf fallacy (in fact, they have a whole list of them, with the "inuit have no word for robin" meme a particularly egregious example) - the idea that since a certain culture has no word for something, they must be totally incapable of conceiving of it, describing it, understanding it, etc. - a notion completely absurd on its face, given that a) people invent new words all the time, and b) you can just describe the thing with a phrase, not a word. for example, if i had never heard the word schadenfreude, that doesn't mean i don't understand the concept of "taking pleasure in another's suffering."i blame orwell for the popularity of this trope. it's true that the hypothesis is named after sapir and whorf, but who's ever heard of them? on the other hand, almost everyone read 1984 in high school, along with its compelling - yet linguistically unrealistic - description of newspeak as the language that would make it literally impossible to even think about concepts like "freedom" because there would be no word for it. 1984 posited that once newspeak was fully adopted, the language itself would do the work of the thought police. but this makes no sense, since without the thought police (and crimestop, doublethink, blackwhite, etc), people could easily just talk about freedom using circumlocutions or a newly invented word. that is to say, newspeak is functionally superfluous as a mind-control device. people have taken newspeak too seriously as a real linguistic possibility, rather than seeing it for what it really is - just another symbol of a party that wants power for its own sake, a linguistic analog of the "boot stamping on the human face - forever."

	 displaying execution devices
	 
    


mark kleiman, writing about possible republican presidential candidate george allen, notes that, among other dubious actions, allen used to display a noose in his law office early in his career. even if — stretching things a bit — we imagine that the noose was intended to refer to legal western hangings rather than the more common informal variety, what kind of twisted character uses a replica of an execution device as office decoration?one might well ask what kind of twisted character uses a replica of an execution-and-torture device as a religious symbol... oh, wait.

	 tragedy, then farce
	 
    


marx said, "history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce." what a fitting quotation to describe the current ideological campaign by the chinese communist party: like a giant company concerned with organizational disarray and a sinking public image, the chinese communist party is trying to remake itself into an efficient, modern machine. but to do so, it has chosen one of its oldest political tools — a maoist-style ideological campaign, complete with required study groups.for 14 months and counting, the party's 70 million rank-and-file members have been ordered to read speeches by mao and deng xiaoping, as well as the numbing treatise of 17,000-plus words that is the party constitution. mandatory meetings include sessions where cadres must offer self-criticisms and also criticize everyone else. ...campaigns of this sort are a legacy of the chinese communist party. when he was president, jiang zemin initiated study campaigns, including one for his signature "political thought," the three represents. more famously, mao introduced as many as 200 campaigns, from the angry purges that predated the cultural revolution era to mass mobilization efforts to exterminate rodents. lest we fear a return to the bad old days, here's the farce part of the story: bao xian has received the praise one might expect from the state media and was listed as one of the most searched phrases on the chinese internet last year. but much of that traffic appears to be driven by cadres downloading essays from the internet to meet homework obligations.in a posting last year, a prominent chinese blogger, keso, said web sites and bloggers were using the ideological campaign as a money-making opportunity by offering essays customized to a person's party rank. the head of a street committee, for example, can find a fake self-criticism essay tailored to that job and then tinker with it to make it seem original.in a posting last year, keso wrote: "the web sites cheat party members, the party members cheat their leaders and the leaders cheat their leaders. so in the end we all cheat the party. this is the comedy of our time." such cynicism underscores why many experts say efforts like bao xian will have little meaningful impact. in fact, some political analysts speculate that mr. hu is using the movement partly as a gesture to ingratiate himself to the older generation of former leaders who remain influential behind the scenes.

no big surprise here, but a new paper in plos-biology did a search for signs of positive selection in the human genome and turned up several genes in different populations that have been selected for very recently. providing the strongest evidence yet that humans are still evolving, researchers have detected some 700 regions of the human genome where genes appear to have been reshaped by natural selection, a principal force of evolution, within the last 5,000 to 15,000 years.the genes that show this evolutionary change include some responsible for the senses of taste and smell, digestion, bone structure, skin color and brain function.many of these instances of selection may reflect the pressures that came to bear as people abandoned their hunting and gathering way of life for settlement and agriculture, a transition well under way in europe and east asia some 5,000 years ago. ...three populations were studied, africans, east asians and europeans. in each, a mostly different set of genes had been favored by natural selection. the selected genes, which affect skin color, hair texture and bone structure, may underlie the present-day differences in racial appearance. some readers may recall that a few months ago i noted a study showing that certain alleles of two genes involved in determining brain size had undergone strong positive selection in the recent past in europeans and asians but not africans, leading certain people to embrace the finding as suggesting that africans are genetically determined to have low iqs. i wonder how they will react to the finding in this study that another gene involved in determining brain size, cdk5rap2, shows signs of selection in the yoruba of nigeria, but not europeans or east asians? (a different brain size gene, cenpj, was selected for in europeans and asians.)ps, i was amused by the picture accompanying the nytimes article - it's as though the photographer was desperate to get the standard picture of the biologist in the white lab coat gazing thoughtfully at a test tube full of purple liquid, but had to settle for equations with a population geneticist.

	 dennett on religion
	 
    


daniel dennett, the namesake of this blog, has a new book coming out about the natural history of religion: for those who do not need to be persuaded, the main draw here is a sharp synthesis of a library of evolutionary, anthropological and psychological research on the origin and spread of religion. drawing on thinkers such as pascal boyer (whose own book is called religion explained) and giving their work his own spin, dennett speculates how a primitive belief in ghosts might have given rise to wind spirits and rain gods, wood nymphs and leprechauns. the world is a scary place. what else to blame for the unexpected than humanlike beings lurking behind the scenes? the result would be a cacophony of superstitions — memes vying with memes — some more likely to proliferate than others. in a world where agriculture was drawing people to aggregate in larger and larger settlements, it would be beneficial to believe you had been commanded by a stern god to honor and protect your neighbors, those who share your beliefs instead of your dna. casting this god as a father figure also seems like a natural. parents have a genetic stake in giving their children advice that improves their odds for survival. you’d have less reason to put your trust in a flying spaghetti monster. at first this winnowing of ghost stories would be unconscious, but as language and self-awareness developed, some ideas would be groomed and domesticated.  sounds like a modern, darwinian twist on hume... no wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in such an absolute ignorance of causes, and being at the same time so anxious concerning their future fortune, should immediately acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers, possessed of sentiment and intelligence. ... nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought and reason and passion, and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves. ...it may readily happen, in an idolatrous nation, that though men admit the existence of several limited deities, yet is there some one god, whom, in a particular manner, they make the object of their worship and adoration. ... his votaries will endeavour, by every art, to insinuate themselves into his favour; and supposing him to be pleased, like themselves, with praise and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggeration, which will be spared in their addresses to him. in proportion as men’s fears or distresses become more urgent, they still invent new strains of adulation; and even he who outdoes his predecessor in swelling up the titles of his divinity, is sure to be outdone by his successor in newer and more pompous epithets of praise. thus they proceed; till at last they arrive at infinity itself, beyond which there is no farther progress.

i want to pose a question about a scene in brokeback mountain, but to avoid spoilers (it's not much of one, actually), i'll pose it in a comment to this post.
