about us
kampers supply was established in may 1975 by marvin and shirley oetjen. their joy of camping with family inspired them to open the rv dealership. "offering the best products in the industry along with service after the sale is our main goal. we live what we sell and we stand behind our products and service. that's why we've been here for 46 years." said marvin.
now the dealership is also run by sons curt and john oetjen. "curt and john's wives also help out in the store and several of the grandkids have worked in the store at one time or the other," said shirley. "it's a family business and we treat our customers like family too."
kamper's supply is a certified service center for most brands of appliances including dometic, norcold, and atwood. in addition, they have a fully stocked parts and accessory store.
"so if you're in southern illinois, western kentucky or southeast missouri, come see us at kampers supply. we have customers from all over the country and they continue to return to us. whether you're in the market for a new rv or you need service on your current camper, come see us. we'll treat you like family too."
-the oetjen family
