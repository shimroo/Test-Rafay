in how to die, joshua s. porter reimagines the christian journey, blending biblical narrative and practical guidance to inspire a radical, authentic discipleship for today's fractured world. for readers disenchanted with institutionalized religion and seeking a radical approach to faith, how to die offers a profound weaving of reimagined biblical narrative, personal story, poetry, parables, and ancient creeds. with a passion for rekindling the spirit of discipleship, pastor joshua s. porter offers: • a unique blend of storytelling, liturgy, and practical spirituality that transcends traditional boundaries and engages with our modern challenges • a gritty, realistic narrative of the bible that helps us think about faith in a fresh way • an unorthodox approach to capturing an orthodox vision for following jesus how to die serves as a provocative handbook for discipleship, inviting spiritually hungry readers to engage with the radical and transformative message of christianity as they rediscover the subversive power of the gospel.coming august  5, 2025




























































 

tessie's four-year-old son was attacked and killed by an alligator in the summer of 1991. a few months later, what she believes to be the same alligator appears in tessie's backyard. her family and friends believe tessie is coming apart, but for tessie, bringing the alligator inside her house is the first step in a cosmic journey to find meaning in her suffering.for seven days, tessie will walk the unforgiving road of memory backward through her upbringing within the grotesque underbelly of southeast georgia, her years as the only female student at a conservative seminary, and her tragically short-lived season as a mother.part southern gothic, part black comedy, the great georgia dirt dragon reads like flannery o'conner by way of ottessa moshfegh-a darkly comic and heartbreaking descent into love, loss, and grief-driven madness.coming october 1, 2024
