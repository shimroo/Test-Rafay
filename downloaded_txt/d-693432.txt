our marines
dedicated 
          to the marines of m co. 3/5 
          and those who served with them
          vietnam, 1966-1971





"for 
            combat vets, 
            by combat vets" 

the 
          majority of this personal website is about the 3rd battalion, 5th marines, 
          m co. and those who served with them in the vietnam war, but we welcome 
          information from combat veterans of all eras. on this site, you will 
          hear personal combat experiences, and reunion stories that will touch 
          your heart, along with some very special tributes to brothers-in-arms. 
          as you read their memoirs and view their pictures, say a few kind words 
          in your heart for these warriors, and for their friends who did 
          not return. god bless them all, and our troops who continue to 
          protect and defend our freedom, wherever they serve.

this 
          is not an official usmc website, but our personal attempt to recover 
          as much information as we can about the 3rd battalion, 5th marines, 
          m co. who served in vietnam. information is from remembrances, pictures, 
          and other related information sent in by marines and fmf corpsmen, and 
          their familes and friends. please don't copy or use their information 
          in any way without express permission to do so.
