time: 12 noon - 2 pm edt (gmt-4)
cost: free for napars members;  $5 for non-members
actar: this event has been approved by actar for 2 ceus. accredited attendees should be prepared to sign in with i-attend app during the presentation.

all attendees will be able to request an attendance certificate during the show.summary:
we will have dan vomhof iii (known to many as dv3) with us to show us how to find a & b stiffness coefficients from nhtsa crash test data. 
this presentation will cover the research of data and calculation of stiffness coefficients for vehicles based on the nhtsa crash tests.
while a presentation of the calculation method will be presented, emphasis will be given to the data points used within the calculations -

crush depths (potentially three  separate sources of depth are available in a given test)
crush width (potentially 2 are available for front and rear tests)
crush energy speed to be used, and how it is calculated
weight (test weight vs. curb weight)

we are pleased to announce heavy vehicle edr training of 2025 hosted by napars:
heavy vehicle event data recorder (hvedr) use in traffic crash investigation analyst training, by forensic training group (https://forensictraininggroup.com/)
this 2.5-day starts with a refresher of definitions, supported vehicles and recent updates to oems. progression into damaged vehicles, supplying power to a partial system, off-vehicle imaging considerations and predictive mentality are discussed. the bread and butter of the course talks about digital data from advanced driver-assistance systems from wabco onlane/onguard, bendix wingman fusion, and detroit assurance. other data sources such as dash cameras, electronic logs and fleet tracking systems are also included. the final pieces of this training opportunity included digital data from trailers and transmissions and how they may be of relevance to semi-truck collision investigations. this class offers a half day of practical testing with collision mitigation system(s).
eligible for actar credits
location: cranberry township public safety training center 
                  1000 maintenance drive
                  cranberry township, pa  16066
may 5 - 7, 2025 ( monday thru wednesday), 8-5 every day.

heavy vehicle forensic mechanical inspection for collision investigators
instructor: bill foche
  obtain the skills required to properly investigate, document, and analyze traffic crashes involving commercial motor vehicles. collisions involving heavy vehicles often encompass unique documentation and analysis components. in this five-day course, crash investigation students learn to inspect collision-damaged heavy vehicles and gain additional skills for examining commercial vehicle crashes. this is a hands-on, basic investigation course for proper examination, documentation, and evidence preservation with no prerequisites. curriculum includes lecture and hands-on training with collision-damaged trucks. forensic work is conducted on the braking systems, suspension systems, wheel systems, and steering systems. our expert instructors provide foundational information about each component, and students learn to use that knowledge to mechanically examine and test a damaged heavy vehicle. participants complete this course able to restore a damaged air-braking system on a heavy-duty commercial vehicle to pre-collision condition in order to collect data for calculations used in evaluating the braking efficiency of a heavy-duty commercial vehicle. students also will be able to identify parts and pieces of steering and suspension systems and explain how the components may have factored into a crash.
