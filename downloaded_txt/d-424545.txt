timeless shapes: fantasias, dances, and variations - tracy cowden & wesley baldwin date and time
this concert brings to life a wonderful range of musical forms in duo music for cello and piano, with music from five composers spanning over two hundred years. discover two of the nineteenth centuryâs most significant and courageous female composers through the sparkling fantasia in g minor by fanny hensel and the lyrical sonata in a minor op. 5 by ethel smyth. enter a journey of moods and impressions by one of americaâs most important art song composers in ned roremâs dances for cello and piano, and delight in the joyful brilliance of beethovenâs variations in f major on âein mã¤dchen oder weibchenâ from mozartâs die zauberflã¶te op. 66. wes and tracy will bring this exploration of musical forms to an end with one final celebratory dance, the mexican âatardecer tapatã­oâ from danzas latinoamericanas by jose elizondo.
