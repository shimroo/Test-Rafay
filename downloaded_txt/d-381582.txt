  the georgia high school rodeo association is a state-wide association of high school students, grades 9 through 12, who participate in rodeos held throughout the state. the ghsra is affiliated with the nhsra which is comprised of 41 states, 5 canadian provinces, and australia.while rodeo is not recognized as a regular high school varsity sport, no other athletic activity in history was ever developed which so embodies the traditions and history of an entire way of life. the events in rodeo grew out of the actual day-to-day duties of the american cowboy, or were dreamed up to further test the courage, stamina, and ability of these westerners.one of the most unique aspects of high school rodeo is that these athletes compete on the same stock that is used by college and professional rodeo contestants.many of the young athletes you will see competing in bareback and saddle bronc riding, bull riding, steer wrestling, goat tying, tie-down, breakaway calf roping, barrel racing, pole bending, and team roping are world-class athletes who compete not only in high school rodeos, but in professional and adult amateur rodeos as well. the cowboy or cowgirl and the animals used in rodeo compete against themselves and the clock, as much as they compete against each other.georgia high school rodeo is a self-supporting organization. we require our members to conduct themselves in an exemplary manner, to abide by a strict dress code when competing, and to "play by the rules". we also require them to maintain their grades at the same level it takes to play high school sports in their respective schools. education is of paramount importance to this organization, and we have a scholarship program in place to help further the education of all of our members. we encourage each contestant in that endeavor.
