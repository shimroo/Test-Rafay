spirited - intelligent - agile - loyal

the entlebucher mountain dog is the smallest representative of the four swiss mountain dog breeds. historically, they were an excellent herding dog, today the entlebucher is first and foremost a lovable family dog. they are versatile, medium sized dogs who are fiercely loyal with huge personalities.
the entlebucher is robust, extremely agile and strong, with bright, intelligent, friendly facial expressions. their temperament is lively, joyful, spirited, confident, and fearless. its medium size and its compact physique with a slightly elongated format and striking tri-color markings give it a strong and elegant appearance. their double coat is short, hard, shiny, and easy to care for.
