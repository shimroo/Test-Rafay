  from the rosh yeshiva, rabbi eliezer 
                    berland, shlit"a.
a letter
                      regarding the teachings of rabbi nachman of
                      breslov.
to every single
                    person in the world, both jew and non jew. rabbi
                    nachman of breslov, who lived almost two hundred
                    years ago, revealed that the world is at this time
                    progressing towards its final completion, and that
                    every single event that takes place, both in the
                    world at large, and to each person individually, is
                    only for the purpose of advancing the world towards
                    its final rectification of complete unity. as it is
                    written, 






                            
the 
                              wolf will also dwell with the lamb, and 
                              the leopard will lie down with the kid; 
                              and the calf and the young lion and the 
                              fatling together; and a little child will 
                              lead them. and the cow and the bear will 
                              feed; their young ones will lie down 
                              together; and the lion will eat straw like 
                              the ox. and the suckling child will play 
                              on the hole of the cobra, and the weaned 
                              child will put his hand on the viper's 
                              nest. they will not hurt nor destroy in 
                              all my holy mountain; for the earth will 
                              be full of the knowledge of hashem, as the 
                              waters cover the sea. and in that day it 
                              will be, that the root of yishai, that 
                              stands for a banner for the peoples, to it 
                              shall the nations seek; and his resting 
                              place will be glorious. and it will come 
                              to pass on that day, that hashem will set 
                              his hand again, the second time, to 
                              recover the remnant of his people, that 
                              shall be left, from ashur, and from 
                              mitzrayim, from patros, and from kush, and 
                              from elam, and from shinâar, and from 
                              chamat, and from the islands of the sea. 
                              and he will set up a banner for the 
                              nations, and will assemble the outcasts of 
                              israel, and gather together the dispersed 
                              of yehuda from the four corners of the 
                              earth.

                              11:5-12





     as rabbi nachman 
                    taught, only once there is complete unity among the 
                    jewish people, will there be an influence upon the 
                    nations of the world to come to harmony. and only 
                    then will it be possible for moshiach ben david to 
                    be revealed, since his arrival is totally contingent 
                    on the unity, peace, love and fellowship amongst 
                    mankind. this can come about only through complete 
                    and total knowledge and awareness, which  can only be achieved
                    through the teachings of rabbi nachman of breslov.
                    for all of his teachings were dedicated to the goal
                    of bringing peace, unity, love and fellowship to the
                    jewish people, and to the entire world. at that time
                    there will be the awesome revelation of moshiach ben
                    david, may he be revealed speedily and in our days,
                    amen.
