- video: accepted offer in 44 days

- video: multiple clients recommend emmer real estate


                                after months on the market with another company and no offers, we were frustrated with the slow process of a sale.

jim's call to us after our home expired was a welcome relief. emmer's marketing showed immediate results with qualified showings. it took just 46 days to get an accepted offer and we achieved 99% of the asking price. we can’t wait to purchase our next home with your team! 

                            
- amanda & chris perks, hartford, wi


                                suzanne and i would like to express our thanks to the emmer team for a great job in finding a buyer and getting our condo sold.
                            
- scott fore, green lake, wi


                                i’ve been involved in commercial real estate for over 30 years and have a pretty good understanding of marketing, negotiating and intricacies of business. while i’ve been involved in 1000s of projects, when it came to selling my house, i knew enough to leave it to professionals. however, like a lot of people, i made the mistake of just “going with a friend." they could not get it sold and it expired off the market. that’s when jim emmer from emmer real estate group called me. 

i interviewed and hired jim and his team to put their pro-active aggressive marketing approach to work. talk about covering all the bases. jim’s marketing generated instant and great buyer activity and 4 written offers for my choosing. jim has great follow-up systems so things do not fall through the cracks. his team handled all the inspection issues, coordinated repairs and got me to the closing table without any hassles. 

being in one aspect of the real estate business, i can appreciate a great company that is at the top of their game. technology has made information a commodity. but there is no substitution for communication, attention to detail, and actually caring. jim and his team excel at all. i would recommend jim for all your residential real estate needs.


- steve palec, saukville, wi


                                we would like to thank jim emmer for his trade-up program.  when our condominium didn’t sell, jim stepped in and relieved our fears by purchasing it at a predetermined price.  thanks again for your innovative ideas, they really work!
                            
- dr. k. schaarschmidt


                                just a quick note of thanks for the efficient job in the sale of my hartford home. during our initial meeting my first thought was to wait till later in the year, however emmer's strategy for the maximum price made sense, and i elected to get the property listed immediately for the spring market.

having a proven marketing team like emmer's really makes a difference. not only did they get an acceptable offer within 5 days, but they also got me 100% of the listed price. i will surely recommend emmer to all my family and friends.

                            
- david & theresa, hartford, wi


                                wow… i just can’t believe that my home is sold. after over 4 years of attempting to sell my home with various real estate companies, emmer real estate group got the job done.

not only did you get my home sold, but jim’s aggressive marketing also brought me 2 strong offers within 22 days on the market, driving the sale price over the listed price. i don’t know how he did it.

the last agency didn’t bring any offers in 7 months at the same listing price you had. all i can say, jim, is thank you so much for making this happen.

the entire staff was a pleasure to work with and always on top of the details to keep me informed along the way. i’m looking so forward to getting settled in the condo i purchased through your company.
