two twins are talking in their mother's womb.- do you believe in life after birth?- of course there is life after birth! maybe our present life is just a preparation for life after birth.- that is nonsense. there is no life after birth. what would such life look like?- i don't know exactly, but i'm pretty sure that there would be much more light, and that we will be able to walk with our legs and eat with our mouths.- that's utter rubbish. you know it's impossible to walk. eating with mouth, hah! we have umbilical cord for that. i tell you, there is no life after birth.- the cord is too short. i'm certain there's something after birth. something entirely different than what we have now.- no one has returned from the born. life ends after birth. besides, life is nothing else than living in this dark environment.- well, i'm not sure what is life after birth like, but in any case we will meet our mom. she will take care of us.- mom!? you believe in mom? and according to you, where is this supposed mom?- all around us, of course. thanks to her we live, without her we wouldn't exist.- i don't believe it. i've never seen mom, and i'm assured that she doesn't exist.- possibly. but sometimes, when we're completely still, you can her singing. you know, i'm assured that after birth, life is only beginning...

look at your lj "interests" list. if you have fewer than 50 interests, pick every fifth one. if you have between fifty and seventy-five interests, pick every seventh one. if you have over seventy-five interests, pick every tenth one. if you have fewer than ten, pick all of 'em. list them on your lj, and tell everyone exactly what it is about these things that interests you so much.basketball: well i've always been a basketball fan since i was young... it's one of those sports that i've always been good... not great... at.. it just comes naturally to me...christian: well for the past 3 months i've been a born again christian and so i figured it would make sense to add this to my list :-)cross movement records: cross movement has to be one of the best groups out there reppin the lord... they are partially responsible for my coming to christ and have many times helped me keep faith just by their songs...god: who can't list god as an interest haha... he created everything... he sent his son to die for us and he saved a wretch like me :-)... the least we can do is acknowledge him in our interest list haha... music: music is an integral part of my life... always has been... since i was young... my mother raised me in a house filled with music and i plan to do the same for my children... my mother loves telling the story of how i knew the entire words to songs before i could even read... i still remember the first song i ever learned "aimee" by pure prarie league... i still love that song to this day....praising the lord: scroll up and read the god section haha.... again praising the lord should be something that we want to do... he's glorious!!!tonic: don't get it twisted yall... tonic is one of the members of cross movement... i listed all them in my interest list...

last night me and the strike team got together at my house and luke brought along a friend of his who needs christ... the brother believes in god but suffers from anxiety and depression and things of that nature... so we went up to the park on marland heights and was jamming out... playing music... moving in the spirit and ministering to the brother... we went til about 11:30 and no one called the cops haha... praise him.... so just keep the brother garrett in prayer please... ask the lord to deliver him and to overcome the demons that he is battling with...also placed an order today for cross movement's holy culture dvd... ambassador's thesis album (i broke my copy - long story haha)... and lacrae's debut album, real talk...so god willing i'll be getting them i figure around wednesday!!!god bless yall!!

directions: type "(your name) is" (with the quotes) into a google search; cut-and-paste the first 10 responses that work. just pull the answers right out of the excerpt google shows you, don't click the link and search around. the only rule is that each one has to start with "(your name) is."1. joshua is advanced in years2. joshua is the sixth book of the bible and the first book of the "history"3. joshua is home now.4. joshua is as sweet and lovable as his sister's but he too has a little mischievous5. joshua is an a grader6. joshua is always on the move7. joshua is an ex-special services mercenary, yet is freakishly loyal to his current boss8. joshua is obviously intended to be jesus 9. joshua is taciturn, answers most questions obliquely, and only wants to help10. joshua is mistaken for one of the inviteesok 4 is pretty darn accurate haha... and number 8 is a link about father joseph girzone's joshua novels which i strongly suggest people read!!!!god bless!
