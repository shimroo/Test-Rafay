new and used parts and earthmoving machinery in australia
since 1984, tilly’s crawler parts has been providing australia with the highest quality earthmoving new and used parts and components. we are proud to be the leading seller for several of the best brands including caterpillar and komatsu. our experienced and knowledgeable team are constantly sourcing the best used and new machinery parts from all over australia, for machines from dozers to excavators and loaders to skid steers.

 new and used parts 
tilly’s is proud to stock over 43,000 new and quality alternative part lines for a range of earthmoving and excavating machinery. based in toowoomba, queensland, we ship both nationally throughout australia, and internationally to specific countries. to make the ordering process as easy as possible, we have a 24/7 online ordering workshop, where you can browse our range of parts and place an order with the team confirming the order within one business day.

 if we sell it, we back it 
we supply new and used parts and components and sell near-new low-hour machines. we understand our customers’ needs and aim to meet them. what never varies is our commitment to back what we sell, and we pride ourselves on what we deliver to ensure we always put the customer first. we understand that sometimes the part ordered is not quite what was required, so we've extended our warranty and returns period to 60 days to allow time for returns and replacements.
  
the right part - or machine -  at the right price, right now – that’s the tilly’s promise.
