     there are three mobile companies in egypt, they are mobinile, vodafone, and the newest company is etisalat. now in egypt with have a new version on the mobile that version is video call. video call is you talk to someone and see him also. only vodafone and etisalat did it but mobinile didn’t do it. you need to have a mobile with two cameras like my mobile n73.

     breathing is made by the respiratory system. respiratory system is the group of organs that take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. the nose, throat, lungs, and passageways that lead to the lungs make up the respiratory system. nose is the main passageway into and out of the respiratory system.

     heart is an organ made mostly of cardiac muscle tissue. it about the size of a fist and is almost in the center of your chest cavity. hear has a left side and a right side that are separated by a thick wall. the right side of heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs. the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.
