all souls parish is a christ-centered and affirming episcopal community committed to welcoming strangers and spiritual seekers from every background. located in north berkeley, california, just a few blocks away from uc berkeley, our congregation reflects the larger community around us–we pursue questions of faith and meaning with a balance of intellectual rigor, robust curiosity, and a willingness to humbly acknowledge that we are forever pilgrims on the way to god’s love.
