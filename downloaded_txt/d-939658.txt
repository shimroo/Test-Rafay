“moco has supported us for years, and we’ve found them to be both extremely flexible and creative. they manage our global website, maintain our package design system for hundreds of products, and build and maintain the retail displays we have in most major retailers in the us. their hong kong office is a big plus for us as this allows us to stretch our budgets through manufacturing in china.”
