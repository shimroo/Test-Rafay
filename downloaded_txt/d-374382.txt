amanda mohamed 



2024 spanish, labor and human resources, global and international studies; civic and community engagement (minor)  



graduating with three degrees, amanda, the spring 2024 liberal arts college marshal, made the most of her time as an undergraduate student. her love of learning took her abroad to buenos aires, argentina, and santiago, chile. this experience provided her the opportunity to stand out as a candidate when she landed a talent acquisition coordinator position with first national bank corp. in pittsburgh. 
 





 





 





ben stewart 



2015 spanish and russian  



“the best way for you to learn a language is to go to a place that only speaks that language, but that’s not feasible for most people. the little things you can do to help are things like changing your phone’s language to another, spending ten minutes a day reading foreign language content or going to the conversation partners program and finding someone who can teach you some of their languages and you can teach them some english. you have to slip in speaking a foreign language each day so the proportionality of language use builds up over time.” 
 





 





 





isabella salcedo 



2025 spanish, human resources and employment relations (iug)  



isabella aims to empower young girls and serves as a role model for aspiring athletes. she is using her spanish major to serve and represent underprivileged communities and to be a support system for individuals without one. 
 





 





 





gabrielle chappel 



2016 spanish and journalism, global and international studies (minor)  



gabrielle said majoring in spanish and experiencing the culture was one of the most beneficial things she ever did for her career. “spanish is like the first language of the kitchen, especially in new york city. listening to someone tell their story in their native language, and they feel comfortable opening up to you because you can understand what they are saying, is a vulnerable and powerful concept.” 
 





 





 





victor frolenko 



2025 spanish, nutritional sciences, neuroscience (minor)  



chaiken scholar, victor, connects with other students through his numerous extracurricular involvements, which combine his passions for dance, food and helping others. originally, only planning to major in the sciences, victor learned about the flexible curriculum offered by the college of the liberal arts from a career coach in the liberal arts career enrichment network. he then added the spanish major to his academic plan, and it took him beyond the confines of the classroom to ronda, spain, for an education abroad experience. there, victor stayed with a host family in a full cultural immersion and attended classes on spanish customs, history and language. 
 





 





 





alexis kauffman 



2024 political science, spanish (minor)  



“in my internship, i worked on a project that organized data results of pennsylvanians’ experiences using publicly funded mental health services. i’ve always been eager to learn more because i grew up in a very rural community, and with this job i was exposed to the raw, honest experiences of those in pennsylvania. i was also able to utilize my spanish minor and translate different surveys. it really sparked more passion for mental health and got me interested in how i can break down the barriers in accessing care, resources and education.” 
 





 





 





sean eden 



2025 sociology, spanish (minor), deafness and hearing studies (minor)  



sean has found numerous ways to pursue his goals and grow personally during his time at penn state, from his classes to the organizations he’s involved with, to the content he creates on social media. in addition to amassing over half a million followers on tiktok, sean is deeply involved in thon and the penn state sign language organization. he hopes his unique combination of interests will lead him to law school after graduation. 
 





 





 





julia montevechi 



2022 italian and criminology  



“my liberal arts education gave me the ability to write effectively and facilitate discussions. i thoroughly enjoyed having class discussions about heavy topics, as i am now comfortable hearing and discussing different viewpoints. further, i got lots of practice writing compelling papers on such topics, which really helped my graduate school applications.”

 welcome to the department of spanish, italian, and portuguese at penn state!our mission is to provide training that not only meets the highest standards of professional research but also prepares students for civic engagement and intellectual autonomy. to fulfill this mission, our goal is to be recognized as a leading department for the scientific study of language and for the integrative study of literature in the broad context of cultural productions. achieving this requires ongoing evaluations of our curriculum at the graduate and undergraduate levels to provide a meaningful course of study that adapts to the different individual interests of our students and to reinforce the already strongly cohesive research paradigms that characterize our faculty.
