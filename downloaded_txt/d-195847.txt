whale protection



more than half of the humpback whales in the north pacific seasonally use the waters around the hawaiian
            islands as their principal breeding and calving wintering ground. the sanctuary's mission is to protect
            hawaiâi humpback whales and this extremely important habitat through closely aligned education, research,
            and resource protection efforts. the sanctuary works with the community and our other partners to reduce
            threats to humpback whales, including through enforcement.

the sanctuary encourages water-based activities that are compatible with our mission of protection. whether
            you're boating, snorkeling, kayaking, fishing, or whale watching, there's plenty to responsibly enjoy in
            hawaiian islands humpback whale national marine sanctuary.






research & science



the sanctuary leads and collaborates in research projects that assess the hawaiâi population of humpback
            whales and their use of sanctuary waters. studies of humpback whales and their activities include
            documenting whale distribution and abundance, examining their behavior and monitoring potential human
            impacts. 






native hawaiian heritage



ocean stewardship is deeply embedded in native hawaiian culture. humpback whales, or koholä, are
            an important part of history, legends, and connection to the sea. the cultural and maritime heritage of
            hawaiâi plays a role in management decisions and how the sanctuary's daily activities are carried out.

hawaiians managed natural resources in ahupuaâa, which are land divisions that run from the
              mountains to the sea. the sanctuary follows this traditional wisdom that recognizes what happens on the
              land (mauka) impacts the ocean (makai). within the ocean, koholä serve as ambassadors for collaborative,
              holistic management to address local and global stressors and protect habitat mauka to makai across the
              hawaiian islands.

            encompassing more than 620,000 square miles of marine and great lakes waters from washington state to the
            florida keys, and from lake huron to american samoa. the network includes a system of 17 national marine
