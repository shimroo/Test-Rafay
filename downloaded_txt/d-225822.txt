information about brigade gunleather custom holsters, gun holsters and leather holsters 








i have been building custom  holsters and leaher holsters for over 19 years and so much experience has contributed to perfected leather holster designs using old world craftsmanship.


a good concealed carry leather holster is the best choice when it comes to protecting your weapon against a possible gun grab.  a good fitting holster is both comfortable and offers the best concealment possible.


i build custom holsters for hundreds of pistols including glock, sig sauer, smith & wesson, kimber, colt, springfield, taurus, heckler and koch, and so many more guns. please call if you don't find your gun model.


my concealed carry gun holsters are completely handmade with the utmost care to last you for years and years.


each leather hide we buy is selected for top quality, the best for gun holsters, belts and western gun holsters.


each gun holster is crafted of american top-grade, full-grain, vegetable-tanned cowhide


the stitching in our leather holsters is of the highest quality thread, stitched with the finest sewing machines available. every start and stop point is double lock-stitched for added strength and durability.


every gun holster, including our western gun holsters, are hand molded around an exact replica gun to get a firm and precise locking fit for the specific gun it's made for.


the edges of my custom holsters and belts are rounded, burnished, then edge dressed.


all of the holsters, western gun holsters  and leather belts have just the right amount of oil and wax to keep from drying.  many coats of wax and oil are done by hand to ensure a life time of use.


i start with american leather hides and i build all of my gun holsters and belts as if they were my own.


my leather lined gun holsters feature a resin-bonded suede lining that's smooth and soft on your gunâs finish.


my unlined leather holsters are silicone-teflon impregnated and waxed and then buffed for a smooth interior.  this is a process i have created with much success to keep your pistol protected from the interior of the holster, meaning the inside of the leather holster is smooth and not rough like less quality holsters and plastics.


each leather holster, gun belt, and western holsters are hand finished with the finest oils and dyes then waxed to a beautiful finish and buffed under heat to bring out a beautiful leather depth and finish to your custom leather holsters.
