reasons.
4we answer the 
phone.4we return calls.



the shofar man was birthed during a trip to israel 
			in 1996.  this occurred when jim and carla barbarossa visited 
			the holy land.  while jim and carla were shopping in the city 
			of jerusalem, they heard a shofar sound and jim purchased a giant 
			yemenite shofar to bring home.  to jim's surprise, g-d spoke to 
			him to blow the shofar as he would lead him.  in october 1996, 
			carla had a dream that she was pregnant, and jim was taking her to 
			the hospital in a small car.  jim reached under the seat and 
			pulled out a jumbo yemenite shofar and said, "i will blow this 
			during the birthing process.  during that same month, jim and 
			carla went to africa with the shofar in hand.  jim blew the 
			shofar as g-d directed, and deliverances, healings, and miracles 
			followed.  since then, jim has been shofar blowing and  
			teaching nationally and internationally on the ancient hebrew 
			instrument of praise, worship, and warfare the jewish shofar.  
			during these teachings, jim was tagged with the nickname "the shofar 
			man."  

today, the shofar man is a retail and wholesale 
			supplier of yemenite shofars, rams horn shofars, gemsbock shofars, 
			exotic shofars, twin shofars, anointing shofars, water buck shofars, 
			roan antelope shofars, texas dall shofars, oryx shofars, blesbok 
			shofars, bushbuck shofars, eland shofars, impala shofars, sitatanga 
			shofars, nyala shofars, pronghorn shofars, big horn sheep shofars, 
			aoudad shofars and springbok shofars,  as well as tallit 
			(prayer shawl) and a full line of judaica products.  all shofar 
			are imported directly from israel, where shofar are handcrafted to 
			meet all kosher  rams horn shofar standards. to buy shofar keep 
			in mind all shofar sounds are not the same. shofar man exceptional 
			sound shofar have a very distinct, clear, crisp shofar sound.  
			during january 2000, jim wrote a book about shofar horns, shofar 
			sounds, shofar blowing, yemenite shofar and rams horn shofar called 
			"the ministry of the shofar". the shofar book is available in 
			english and as el shofar in spanish. 

the following are a couple of scripture references 
			found in the book about the shofar:"and the sons of aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; 
			and they shall be to you for an ordinance forever throughout your 
			generations. and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth 
			you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be 
			remembered before the l-rd your g-d; and ye shall be saved from your 
			enemies." (numbers 10:8-9)"and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed 
			louder and louder, moses spake, and g-d answered him by a voice."  
			(exodus 19:19)
