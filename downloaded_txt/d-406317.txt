blackfolkkum4teri woke up one day in 2011 and people were just evil. felt like i woke up from a coma. all these kids kept yellin “stay woke” on social media. but most of em are still sleeping. you ever seen invasion of the body snatchers!? this is definitely lovecraftian. we defend the most vile shit for the sake of being woke and we don’t even see it. to tell you the truth, before 2011 i felt myself slipping. i had to question my conscience a time or two. i felt bad because i couldn’t feel bad. i mean you are supposed to feel something about the shit you do or say right ? we can’t always be ambivalent. then again some of us circa 2020 are two sensitive about the wrong shit. and from the outside looking in, we look like a bunch of assholes

the system vs black liberation


apr. 1st, 2016 at 7:36 pm



 


blackfolkokuojithere is a raging debate taking place right now within the movement for black liberation. it is a debate over how best for us to build black power. do we do this by working within the system, or do we destroy the system, and build upon its debris, a new world of black power and progress. working within the system, of course, has severe drawbacks because the energy put into securing a footing for black people really, at the end of the day, gives more power, both economically and politically, to the white status quo. however, destroying the system, if it were to happen instantaneously, could be devasting for thousands of black families and individuals all over the country and the african diaspora. so, what is to be said? perhaps, as we continue to become increasingly politicized, we could apply some gradualism to the breaking up of the system, but -- in the meantime -- it seems that many will continue to work within the system. i truly need to do some more thinking on this.

social media and nigeria's new civil war


oct. 27th, 2015 at 10:02 pm



 


blackfolkikeonwubuyanigeria has been on the throes of a virtual civil for the past few years. this war which has pitched brother against brother is fought thankfully not in a battlefield but on social media. the battlegrounds are facebook, nairaland, twitter, to a lesser extent instagram and other sundry online forums. this war is basically between the igbos and yorubas with the other tribes acting as not so innocent bystanders. these two tribes due to their large, enlightened and educated populations dominate the social media sphere in nigeria. the niger deltans and other southern minorities tend to passively support the igbos, while the hausas, who are really the target of the igbo attack, support the yorubas explicitly. this war have with words as its weapons, have added to the vocabulary such interesting words and phrases as “zoo”, “wailing wailers”, “ofe nmanu”, “biafraud”, “dullards”, “elections have been won and lost” amongst other colourful words and phrases.it's hard to know the origins of this war. historically, ndigbo dislike the hausa/fulani and distrust the yorubas. the yorubas, distrust the igbos and dislike the hausas. the hausas dislike the igbos and distrust the yorubas. this circle of dislike and distrust culminated in the nigerian civil war of 1967-1970 which pitched the igbos as biafra against the rest of nigeria. to a good proportion of igbos, the biafra war was between the igbos and hausas and they believe they had an agreement from some yoruba “leaders” to join them in the fight against the hausas and felt betrayed when these yoruba “leaders” reneged and instead of being at best neutral, became staunch antagonists.the advent of social media and its attendant freedom of speech has given a new generation an avenue to vent their spleen and spew the hate that almost destroyed their parent’s generation. this new bitter phase of the war began with the emergence of the all peoples congress  (apc). the worst nightmare for an igbo propagandist is an alliance between the old enemies of yorubas and hausas, which is what apc depicts when viewed along nigeria's ethnic fault lines. the igbos had adopted the then nigerian president goodluck ‘ebele’ ‘azikiwe’ jonathan as one of their own. the fact the jonathan is from bayelsa state in the niger delta of ijaw extraction is of little consequence. he is not yoruba, he is not hausa/fulani, he is a southerner, he is a christian, his name is azikiwe, so he is as close to igbo as you can get without actually being igbo. the igbos supported jonathan and pdp in 2011 and were ready to back him to the hilt in 2015. they viewed any attack on jonathan as a personal attack on igbos, the belief was that the yorubas and hausa/fulani are uniting for the sole purpose of kicking out a southern christian minority. it also didn’t help that a lot of the apc leaders were muslims. on the igbo side of social media at the run-up to the election, the apc was often depicted as a muslim party and even called sponsors of boko haram.the yoruba protagonists on social media on the hand viewed apc as the best thing since sliced bread. they often made reference to the “cluelessness” of president goodluck jonathan, while depicting buhari as the messiah in waiting and bola tinubu as john the baptist. a lot of yorubas felt shortchanged by the jonathan government and saw the apc as an avenue to get back into the mainstream of nigerian politics. to do that, they had to demystify and then crush the ruling government and their social media mouthpieces, the igbos. the yorubas were the harshest critics of the jonathan administration on social media and were the propaganda machine behind the apc.the defeat of the ruling pdp at the 2015 general elections means that there is now a role reversal. the hunter has now become the hunted. where in the past we had “jonathan the clueless” now we have “buhari the dullard”. the igbos on social media have now become the main critics of the buhari administration for which they have earned the unenviable name of the “wailing wailers”, and they in turn call buhari supporters inmates of the “zoo”. only on social media!any news on social media can be used as a tool for ethnic points scoring. from the ethnic make-up of the appointments of president buhari, the long awaited ministerial list, the death of the ooni of ife and the “abobaku” debacle; utterances of femi fani-kayode, the fallout between super eagles head coach sunday oliseh and his erstwhile captain vincent enyeama, even as mundane a topic as the nominees for the headies awards has the internet ethnic bigots slugging it out.the emergence of the likes of nnamdi kanu, indigenous people of biafra (ipob) and radio biafra has taken this war to whole new level. this internet army complete with facebook pages, twitter handles, a flag, virtual embassies and even a national football team have become the greatest social media phenomenon in nigeria. it is arguable that this group is a match to the very effective apc propaganda that won buhari the presidency on social media. in nnamdi kanu, they have an arrowhead who seems to have captured more young igbo hearts than his earlier incarnation, ralph uwazurike of massob. kanu with his take no prisoners, no holds barred way of speaking, he has captured the hearts and minds of many an igbo youth who now believe the igbos are better off as an independent state than in nigeria. it is very common to see many ndigbo signing off their comments with kanu’s catchphrase “chukwu okike abiama”.this war will only be fought and lost on social media. it gives a lot of people an avenue to exhibit their innate bigotry. it shows us that nigerians are not really the most tolerant of people and that from generation to generation, the tribal fault lines on which nigeria is built has not been repaired. it is alarming that a good number of the hate protagonists on social media are products of unity schools and the national youth service corps. these were schemes that were initiated foster unity by bringing people of different ethnicities and background together at a younger age. this is to ensure that we have unity in our diversity. these are people who work with and socialise with people of different ethnicities in real life but come on social media to score cheap points. are these people really ethnic bigots? some definitely are, but the majority are noisemakers who are enjoying a game of “my tribe is better than yours”. for those beating the drums of war, if you want to test your power, there is boko haram to be defeated, your country needs willing soldiers.ike onwubuya writes from the united kingdom

"the poll trolls: how the democrats really lost the midterms"


nov. 6th, 2014 at 10:27 am



 


blackfolkricomsmith77originally posted by ricomsmith77 at "the poll trolls: how the democrats really lost the midterms"i admit that i watch way too much news and internet media.  i especially watch waaaay too much msnbc on a daily basis. i admit that i drink too way much coffee and smoke way too much weed......ok not really not that much!  i also admit.....that i was wrong about this year's midterm election results.  i admit that i had more confidence in the democratic electorate to get out and vote this year, and that they would win the races they were supposed to.  i admit i was wrong.........really wrong!but i have to admit i was right about one thing:  the elections were fixed in the gop's favor due to the poll trolls. oh yes, they are real.....and the reason the democrats lost the midterms this year.who are the poll trolls you say?  well simply put, they are the one's who have seeked out to suppress voting in certain states around the country.  these are the same people who go out screaming that there is a voter fraud problem going on and they are the ones who can fix it.  but if anyone has been paying attention like i have, then you should have already figured out that this is called reverse psychology.....a technique involving the advocacy of a belief or behavior that is opposite to the one desired, with the expectation that this approach will encourage the subject of the persuasion to do what actually is desired: the opposite of what is suggested.  yes, that definition is straight out of wikipedia, in case you were wondering.  meaning, they tell everyone that the democrats are committing voter fraud, but it's really the gop thats been doing it all along. see, those damn trolls are clever.  they know how to scare the devil out of the general public......they've been doing it for years.  they go on their public forum, called fox news, and spread their trollish agenda through their minions on a daily basis.  and, they've gotten smarter too.  they've figured out how to use social media to their advantage, which is something they didn't really take advantage of much during the 2008 elections, but started to catch on during the 2012 cycle.  they knew the map was starting the change in the democrats favor because the general population was becoming more informed.  and that is poison to a troll......more informed people = more democratic voters = gop go bye bye!so enter voter suppression laws, and voter id laws, and early voting restrictions, and gerrymandered districts.........and poof!!  the gop wins the midterms, and the democrats get shipped back to the chocolate factory with a defective item......obama chocked full of nuts!!now yes, i know the democrats are as much to blame for not actually showing up to vote this year.  in general, midterms don't usually have high turnout.  most people only vote during the presidential years, so it's hard for local and state election officials to get everyone enthusicatic about standing in a long line to vote.  unless the people running are getting lots of media attention, most democrats just don't really care enough to bother, whereas the opposite is true for the gop.  the gop have understood for years how important the midterm elections can be because if they want to gain power, they have to win locally.  they will pour millions of dollars and run thousands of ad campaigns to influence the voters to their agenda.....or lack thereof.  either way...it works!and the democrats got a harsh, harsh reality of what that looks like this time around............and the poll trolls will be watching again, in 2016!

"the democrats kicked their asset....and lost!"


nov. 5th, 2014 at 5:17 pm



 


blackfolkricomsmith77originally posted by ricomsmith77 at "the democrats kicked their asset....and lost!"one after one, they fell like dominoes on a table.  i’ve heard of political “waves” before, but what i was witnessing on this election night was worse than watching my beloved georgia bulldawgs get blown away by the florida gators last weekend…….only i knew this was bigger than college football.they had been saying it all along: the gop is going to take control of the senate during this midterm cycle.  the democrats were going to lose seats in the house of representatives.  they were right.  but what really happened was something that no one, not even faux news (fox news) saw coming.  you see, the gop decided to make this midterm cycle all about one person…….obama.  they figured that instead of running against the person they were actually running against on the ticket, they would take advantage of the president’s unpopularity and pounce, like a bunch of wildcats in heat.  and it worked…….resoundly! they took full control of the us senate, picked up more house seats, and, they even won some governor’s races in blue states……illinois and maryland.  to put it bluntly and candidly, the gop didn’t just beat the democrats….they kicked their ass.so what the hell really happened?  it’s quite simple really:  the democrats completely underestimated the voters and did not embrace the president…….at all!!  they can go ahead and try and blame obama for losing control of congress, but it was the democrats that lost control of the message that was sent out during the 2008 and 2012 election cycle.  they made a decision to run away from the president because they were afraid to be seen with the first african-american to hold that office.  they were afraid to be put in an advertisement that might be used against them in states where obama is really unpopular.  they were afraid of the gop and their base.  they were afraid.  and it backfired.  and now obama can sit back in the oval office and laugh at them for being such “jackasses” for not letting him be more involved.  i mean, he’s done this before…..quite well in fact!  but, you can also say that obama himself didn’t really try to assert himself more into the races as he should have.  he could have gone to every state that had close, contested races and stumped for all the candidates in play.  however, they told him, “no thanks, mr. president….we got this!”the results of their stupidity should be noted at this point.here’s the ironic part…..this is funny, you’ll like this one:after realizing that they might need a little help to get over the top, considering the latest polls were giving the gop an advantage or gaining ground on them in key states:  georgia, north carolina, new hampshire, iowa, louisiana, and a few others, the democrats did something quite bold…….and really stupid:  they went to the african-american community for help to win their elections.wait…….what?did they really go there?  did they really try to ask for help from a group of people, who are still strong supporters of obama, and think it was going to work?  there are a lot of adjectives you can insert here “_______” to describe the democrats and what they were thinking on this one.  but i can say this:  no one thought it was going to be this bad!  they underestimated, not only the gop, but the electorate themselves.  the underestimated the intelligence of their own base, the democrats, and they didn’t use the one person who has brought them together twice in mass quantities.  the fact that president obama’s approval rating across the country is low, is a reflection of mood of how people feel about government in general.  obama’s approval rating is higher than anyone in washington dc right now……that includes everyone in congress and the supreme court.  he may not be running on high octane like he was when he was first elected, but he has managed to stay above everyone in dc his entire presidency so far.   he more than likely would  have made a difference in most states, but the democrats misplayed the race card. they decided to keep him as far away as possible, but still ask the black community to vote for them……as if msnbc and facebook somehow doesn’t exist anymore.  *smacks hand on head!*to be fair, the gop had a much better game plan this time around.  their ground game was improved and they spent tons of money in certain elections that mattered.  but the most obvious reason the gop won so big was the very reason the democrats lost so big………president obama.the democrats tried to run away, but the gop pounced that ass!the irony is quite amusing actually.i expect there is a lesson to be learned from all this somewhere.  the democrats will be doing the blame game for a while, which is always expected after a beat down like that.  what they really need to do is some soul searching.  they need to go back to the message that got them into to power in the first place, and stop worrying about the polls so much.   they need to stop running away from the things that have been working, and start owning up to them. they need to do what the gop does so well against them…….not be afraid to use their best asset.

survey on relationships


oct. 8th, 2014 at 12:15 pm



 


blackfolknikki5124hey everyone,i am a psych student at the university of florida. i'm doing a study on our attitudes toward relationships. i've posted the survey around, but my demographics are skewed with 91% of the participants being white. i was able to post it on my facebook page and got some of my family members to take it, but i need more black participants. it should only take 2-3 minutes. you have to read a short scenario and then answer some multiple choice questions about it. there are no right or wrong answers, so you can answer in whatever way you think is best.  i would also love some advice on other sites outside of lj or communities with lj where this could be posted.thank you in advance! i really appreciate anyone that completes the survey! :-)survey link: https://ufl.qualtrics.com/se/?sid=sv_bhnyi2iycyazlm5 --nikki

black children born in wedlock are extremely likely to have one white parent

blackfolkjsl32given the dividend marriage pays, i am really ambivalent about this trend myself.  further, that parent is almost as likely to be the father as the mother, which is new and recent (last half decade or so).what do you think about this trend?

blackfolk and self-publishing/indie publishing?


dec. 27th, 2013 at 5:20 pm



 


blackfolkjsl32i've finally reached a place in my life where i can get writing regularly and part of that is discovering the world of indie publishing.  i am curious, if anyone's around, what lj blackfolk think about it.  i remember a lot of fandom of color debate about gatekeeping issues in traditional publishing and a lot of talk about chromatic presses, but nothing came of any of it, as far as i recall.but out there in self-publishing land, black housewives are making mad cash writing ebooks with afro-typic black women on the covers and it's such a contrast of vigor to the rounds of lamenting i still see when i peep at speculative fiction writers of colors' blogs.  so the floor's open, if anyone's out there during this slow holiday time.  amazing opportunity or another hurdle?  i obviously see it as the former.

the reason i write about race |the political pragmatic


nov. 30th, 2013 at 6:36 am



 


blackfolkfay paxtonhttp://thepoliticalpragmatic.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-reason-i-write-about-race.htmldespite the struggles and sacrifices, systemic discrimination, entrenched racism and electoral fraud exist to the present moment, but most of us have been brainwashed into believing the civil rights movement  brought freedom, liberty and democracy to black america.  because the old propaganda tricks which have been used to delude the u.s. masses throughout the history of the country are still employed to this day.  blacks are forced to engage in a relentless exercise of psychological warfare with those who insist on creating a white savior pathos, from jesus to tarzan.  and sometimes blacks lose the battle and themselves.  that is why i write about race.i don’t write about race to disparage whites or to pour salt on old wounds.  i am deeply aware of the contributions whites have made and many still make in order to secure the fundamental rights of others.  there have always been those who played a prominent, active, supportive and moral role. i needed to make the acknowledgement because i write about race, unapologetically, historically and realistically.i write about race because it shaped our founding and is the heartbeat of this nation.  the election of barack obama struck at the very foundations of the racial impulses and offenses which are a part of our nation's dna.  i write about race because whites who make the headlines and the newscasts are those who resist civil rights most blatantly and aggressively.  i write so racist fools like richard cohen don’t simply get a free pass to be insulting and insinuating just because they can.  i write about race because of my grandson, who constantly searches for an image of himself and at just seven years old, has already decided that his country is hate-filled and intolerant.  i write about race for him and anyone else who can confront truth and honesty about who and why we are.

blackfolkflaxendandelionwell here's my attempt to awake blackfolk from its slumbers.here in australia it's grand final time, where our two major football codes are having their equivalent to the super bowl (it's always on the last weekend in september).for the first time ever the fremantle dockers, a team out of western australia, has made it. i fully expect melbourne to be swamped with purple people from out west this time next week. and though i can't say for sure this is a first, they have on their team what i'm fairly certain is the only (mixed race) african-american in the entire league. zac clarke is actually from melbourne, black dad, white (australian) mom.and a bit of trivia: i don't follow the football too closely until the end of the season when it gets exciting, so i don't have a team. but my favorite player is harry o'brien from the collingwood magpies, who's very vocal about the racism, sexism, and homophobia found in his sport. it's very unusual, particularly on that last count. he's also easy on the eyes. my co-worker's next door neighbor here is a documentary filmmaker originally from new york named jeff daniels who's doing a film on him. "publicly, there have been statements of support, but privately, in many locker rooms, footy boardrooms and newspaper offices, he will continue to be portrayed as an eccentric dissident.it is the only way that the hairy-chested footy culture knows how to deal with an enlightened human being who dares to challenge the conventional wisdom of their world."more.o'brien battling depression, suicide issues...daniels had previously done a doco on the plight of chinese uighurs, and beijing felt so strongly about censoring the film, they hacked into the melbourne international film festival's website and changed the dates and times for the viewings so people couldn't go. it made international headlines.director says film censorship backfired.

help me become a math teacher!


sep. 8th, 2013 at 8:40 pm



 


blackfolkpapertigersa few years ago, my family staged an intervention to convince me it was time for me to go back to school. i got a full scholarship to college when i was 16, but left at 18 to take care of my family (mother and nephews). my mother has passed and the boys are now grown, healthy, and productive. i've wanted to be a teacher since i was 12, and i'm only a few semesters away from getting my certification (i've applied to graduate in december of 2014). i was awarded a scholarship to mount st. mary's college in l.a. i raised the funds to get out here from maryland, but now i need a car to complete my participant observation and student teaching requirements. please donate to and/or share my indiegogo campaign to help me complete the final steps in achieving my dream. thanks a lot!

ebony magazine


aug. 9th, 2013 at 1:27 pm



 


blackfolkcinema_babethe september edition of ebony magazine features 4 different covers each with the headline: we are trayvon. the first cover features martin’s family–sybrina fulton, tracy martin and their son jahvaris fulton. three others versions feature prominent aa men and their sons wearing a grey hoodie:  director spike lee and his son, miami heat player dwyane wade with his sons, and actor boris kodjoe and his son.yes, there are people who were making snarky comments in the press and there was a false story floated that tea party members were going to boycott the issue. *a false story people*. but i dont care about that.none of this is about that.i just wanted to post this because of the power of the image. i have a beautiful nephew who is only a few years younger than trayvon martin. and he owns a hoodie.

blackfolksarafinapekkalasaw this on geek feminism: martha chumo, a kenyan girl who couldn't get to the us to go to hacker school, decided to start a school in nairobi for east african software developers. she's trying to raise $50k to get the school off the ground, so maybe think about donating and/or linking it around :)

dead giveaway - a teachable moment?


may. 9th, 2013 at 11:11 pm



 


blackfolkmadelinehow can a song be so problematic yet so catchy? also *dead* at the link to the cover song at the end.this story has been covered on various npr stations over the last couple of days, not so much focused on the rescued women but the politics of presenting/ portraying the hero in the media has sparked discussions of race and class. so much to say about this. what are your thoughts on the coverage/ subsequent internet meme-ification?
