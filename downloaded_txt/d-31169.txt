br rangers, burning man, usa
"we had the most amazing experience last month, travelling with christian as our guide. chris is a walking encyclopedia when it comes to tracking, animal behavior and even survival in the wild. we spent 17 days with him through out namibia, covering all the highlights. highly recommended."








kitty frazer, tennessee
"chrigi is a man who over decades has built a deep relationship with nature. he's happy to share that with any who travel with him. his knowledge of flora and fauna allows him to know where to expect wildlife, and weave a rich tapestry of the ecosystem as you travel through it."








margit hofbauer, austria
