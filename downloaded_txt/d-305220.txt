welcome
the pug’s motto is the latin phrase “multum in parvo” (a lot in a little)—an apt description of this small but muscular breed. they come in two colors: fawn or black. the large round head, the big, sparkling eyes, and the wrinkled brow give pugs a range of human-like expressions—surprise, happiness, curiosity—that have delighted owners for centuries.
once the mischievous companion of chinese emperors, and later the mascot of holland’s royal house of orange, the small but solid pug is today adored by his millions of fans around the world. pugs live to love and to be loved in return. a pug’s character is unique in that he is a clown at heart with a terrific sense of humor but at the same time he carries himself with great dignity. they are not too delicate for fun and games. a pug is anxious to please, anxious to learn. if you have an interest in the pug, this is the site to visit. our members are active as caretakers, protectors and lovers of the breed, committed to a high standard of owning, caring for and/or breeding.
