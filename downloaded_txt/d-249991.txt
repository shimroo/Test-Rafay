we believe that god loves all people, and invite all persons to participate in our fellowship, especially extending our welcome to children and their families. our children are invited to share in worship, and can also attend weekly faith formation classes. since 1916, we have jointly celebrated the traditions of two historical churches: the presbyterian church, usa and the united church of christ. beginning in 2000, we began welcoming members who choose to join our congregation as "the united churches of olympia", but do not wish to affiliate with a particular denomination. today we are a community of members, friends, seekers and doubters striving to support each other.everyone is welcome at the united churches of olympia!the united churches makes explicit the welcome of lgbtqia+ folks and we are committed to advocating for transgender, gender non-binary, and people of all gender identities in the church and society.  our membership affiliation includes:  covenant network of presbyterians, ucc open and affirming coalition, ucc join the movement and more light presbyterians.  we are a pc(usa) matthew 25 church.
