  hegemony and hollywood: a
critique of cinematic distortions of women of color and their stories
by brenda cooper, utah state university: "dinesen poignantly expressed
her grief over the changes the european settlers had forced on kenyans
and their culture, and her compassion for their struggles to maintain
their identity and dignity. in the film, however, dinesen is recast as
one of the 'offending european settlers, forcing her will on the native
people without any sensitivity to their wishes or culture' (cooper
& descutner, p. 240). further, the compassion dinesen expressed for
the country and its people in her autobiography are appropriated by the
film's leading male character, denys finch hatton." [more movie trivia

karen blixen (1885-1962), also known by her pseudonym, isak
dinesen, is famous for her memoir, out of africa,
and for several works of fiction, including seven gothic tales (1934) and winter's tales (1942).
a 2007 poll
of opinion in her native denmark lists karen blixen as one of the most
representative personalities in danish history.  she was several
times
nominated for the nobel prize in literature. she wrote in english,
after living on a coffee farm in kenya from 1914 to 1931.



she married her second cousin, baron bror blixen of sweden, thereby
acquiring the title baroness. following their separation and divorce,
she had a long affair with the safari hunter, denys finch hatton, son
of a titled english family. in  1931, after losing the coffee farm
in
the great depression, karen blixen returned to denmark and embarked on
the writing career that lasted until her death in 1962. she was played
by meryl streep in the 1985 film out
of africa.


 literature:
karen blixen  [isak dinesen] can be compared with no other
writers. her
voice was formed by her scandinavian roots, and influenced by a wide
variety of works of european literature. her writing places emphasis on
story, rather than characters, and on the philosophical understanding
of personal identity. her stories underline a fascination with the role
of fate in controlling the lives of human beings. she believed that a
person's response
to the vicissitudes of fate offers a possibility for heroism and,
ultimately, for immortality.



a small selection of her literary influences include:





soren kierkegaard: at least thirteen of isak dinesen's tales
are based, in part, on stories by the great danish philosopher.
the viking sagas

shakespeare's plays

mary shelley
percy bysshe shelley
lord byron

homer's iliad and odyssey

the story of her life


isak dinesen first came to public
attention in 1934 with her book seven gothic tales.
she was unable to find an
interested publisher in england or denmark, and was first published by
random house in the united states. from the beginning she was a
mysterious figure; most readers thought she was a man. 


her tales
were
convoluted, weird, enigmatic, and sometimes erotic. almost every
sentence was
like a prose poem. each tale--taking place in another era--involved a
complicated puzzle, a
violent event, a case of mistaken identity, and an unexpected ending.



the tales offered an existential flavor in archaic disguise. they
seized the
imagination of the american public, where the collection was issued by
the book of the month club. the era loved short stories, which
appeared universally in popular magazines.


in 1938,
when a very different book, out of africa,
was published by
the same author, the reading public was tantalized to learn that isak
dinesen was a danish baroness, whose real name was karen blixen.
americans had long been fascinated with aristocracy, and wealthy young
americans--cornelia vanderbilt and nancy astor, among others--often
married into titled european families.



the prose in out
of africa displayed an entirely different kind of
writing from isak dinesen's first book. out of africa
looked back with
nostalgia upon her life as a settler on a coffee plantation in kenya.
it presented a lyrical depiction of life on a colonial farm, with
deaths,
drought, and disappointments--as well as great and tragic friendships.


isak
dinesen was among the first authors to describe africans as
individuals rather than as stereotypes. she has been criticized for
participating in the colonial intrusion into africa, and also for
making poetic comparisons of various personalities--both kenyans and
white settlers--to birds and animals. she has often been labeled racist
for her frank depiction of the power differences between whites and
blacks in early twentieth century africa.



her memoir was arresting in many ways, especially in its oblique
references to the author's love story with the english hunter denys
finch hatton. it left the reader tantalized by a series of enigmas:
who
was the writer's husband, and what happened to him? why didn't she and
finch hatton marry? did she ever plan to return to africa? what was her
life now?


the
answers to these questions remained private until after her death.
she had married a swede named baron bror von blixen-finecke, her second
cousin, from whom she took the title baroness. bror was the twin of the
celebrated horseman, hans von
blixen-finecke, the man karen was in love with in her youth. 
bror himself wrote a book describing how he and his wife had set
out to run a pioneer farm in kenya. they divorced after eleven
difficult years of marriage.  she fought the divorce, and her letters from africa
suggest that she loved her husband. bror married again twice, but
karen did not remarry and never had children.



her talent for hospitality in kenya attracted a variety of
aristocratic and bohemian friends, including berkeley cole. she called
denys finch hatton the love of her life, but the nature of their
relationship has never been clear.  she appears to have suffered
two miscarriages during the eight or more years of the affair. however,
the writer beryl
markham, a friend of karen blixen and denys finch
hatton, claimed to biographers that finch hatton was homosexual.


due to the world wide economic
depression and miscalculations
in
pioneer
farming,
karen
blixen's
coffee
farm,
financed
by
her
family,
never
turned
a
profit. 
she
was
homesick
much
of
her
time
in
africa.
although
she
had
her
farm
for
nearly
18
years,
she
spent
five
years
of
that
time
in
her
beloved
denmark.
she
left
kenya
in
1931
and
never
returned.



karen blixen's father wilhelm
dinesen, a retired soldier from a wealthy
family, had written books of essays on hunting. her mother ingeborg
westenholz came from a family of ship-owners. both parents grew up on
country estates on the danish peninsula of jutland. the dinesens were
connected to the royal circle, although not titled. the crusading
westenholzes often involved themselves in politics. scholars have noted
the differences between the families, but have failed to note their
similarities:  both families shared strong opinions on cultural
ethics, and both cared little for high society. wilhelm dinesen's
father a. w.
dinesen wrote an article critical of the french wars in north
africa. ingeborg westenholz's brother, aage, and sister, mary bess,
were both subjects of newspaper scrutiny for their political activism,
as was karen blixen's sister ea. 



ingeborg
westenholz dinesen became the first woman in denmark elected
to a town council. wilhelm dinesen eventually won a seat in the danish
parliament. he committed suicide in 1895 (karen was 10 years
old)--reportedly because of syphilis, a disease he feared would lead to
madness. 




her mother's family were strong unitarians, in a country where the
state religion was lutheranism. no one, least of all karen blixen, has
given her upbringing the credit it is due for her innovative approach
to philosophy. she disapproved of any one-sided ideology. she appears
to have consolidated her own beliefs from a variety of great works of
literature, including the old and new testaments, but her
fascination with fate was most influenced by her scandinavian heritage.


she and
her two sisters were educated at home, as was common for women of the
wealthy class, while her two brothers went to school. she had written
stories at an early age, the first of which were published when she was
22. she also studied art for a few years in copenhagen, and her writing
was influenced by her interest in painting. she grew up on a rural
estate, where the differences between the peasant and upper classes
made a deep impression on her. as out of africa
reveals, she never lost her love for the peasants nor for the class
system that existed in her youth.


she went on to write more collections of
tales, a few essays, a novel, and another short memoir. her stories
emphasize the power of  "the mask"--the public persona that
reveals the hidden personality and draws attention to the talent of the
artist. "by thy mask i shall know thee" was her credo.  she made
well-received readings on danish radio, she was photographed wearing
elaborate
costumes, and she made a dramatic visit to the united states--home of
her most enthusiastic reading public--where she related to audiences,
in her deeply accented, sonorous voice,
stories she had learned by heart.


privately,
the
author
suffered
much
of
her
life
from
a
variety
of
illnesses
that began when she lived in africa. her illnesses have been
the subject of speculation by uninformed writers, and a wide variety of
misinformation has been circulated about her.




karen blixen herself attributed her
symptoms to syphilis acquired from
her husband.  however, her medical records do not support the
diagnosis of syphilis late in life. she was first diagnosed with
syphilis at the age of 29, a year after she married. she was
prescribed mercury and arsenic, which were the treatment for the
disease in her time. it is now believed that some of her
later symptoms were the result of heavy metal poisoning. late in life
karen blixen suffered from a gastric ulcer, and a third of her stomach
was removed--the only treatment available at that time. late
photographs show the malnutrition that resulted from the surgery. some
have labeled her thinness "anorexia," but no documents support these
claims. heavy smoking contributed to her ills.


when she
left kenya at the age of 46, she returned to the country
manor called rungstedlund, north of copenhagen, where she was born, and
she lived there as a writer until the end of her life. as
in africa, she was primarily dependent on her family for financial
support.
her brother thomas and sister elle made it possible for her to keep
the
family home in denmark, where the furniture had been bequeathed by
family and
friends. karen blixen's clothes were ordered from a tailor,  and
she
had otherwise few possessions. her writing helped pay for hired help. she employed a staff of workers that included
a live-in cook and secretary. toward
the
end
of
her
life
karen
blixen
appealed
to
the
general
public
for
contributions
to
protect
her
house
and
land. 
the
successful
campaign
led
to
the
creation
of
the
rungstedlund
foundation,
which
now
oversees
the
40-acre
(16
hectare)
property
as
a
museum
and
bird
reserve.



karen
blixen
was
adventurous, within
limits. her
husband taught her to hunt but she stopped hunting after the
divorce.  (she
describes
an
occasional
shooting
expedition
with
denys
finch
hatton,
yet
there
is
no
evidence
she
ever
went
on
safari
with
him.)
during
the
first
world
war
she once
accompanied supplies for the colonial army. in the second
world war, she helped smuggle jews out of german-occupied denmark. she said she liked danger, and those who
defied authority. 


for a short time
in old age, she fell in love with a much younger danish poet, thorkild
bjørnvig, but the relationship, based on
mutual admiration, remained
platonic. young male writers, who at first came to karen blixen for
support in their careers, later turned against her. throughout her life
she had been a magnetic figure with a range of important friends, but,
as her physical ills mounted, she became increasingly difficult.




evidence suggests she may have been
dependent on amphetamines and
perhaps on painkillers. she failed to win the nobel prize, although she
was twice nominated, and, some said, this was because she was disliked
by key personalities. ernest hemingway
graciously said she should have
won the prize instead of himself in 1954.


karen
blixen died in 1962 at the age of 77, of malnutrition. her books, first
released
in english and, later, in danish, are still published in many
languages.
great interest in the author revived with the release of the movie out
of africa in 1985. her homes have been converted to the karen
blixen
museum near nairobi and the karen blixen museet in denmark.

writings are listed. her life is also presented by chronology.

and articles analyzes karen blixen's contribution to

out
of
africa: the
movie and
the life trivia:
  two movies based on isak dinesen
stories won oscars, in 1986 and 1987. both
have been impressive favorites with audiences for over 20 years. the
two movies could not be more different in their achievement. out of
africa relied for its appeal on a huge budget, big hollywood
stars,
elaborate costumes, a big-name director, and a romanticized version of
events. babette's feast is an
artistic masterpiece, with unknown actors
and a danish director--filmed with exquisite subtlety and authentic
adherence to isak dinesen's original story. both out
of
africa and babette's
feast
re-create beautifully an exotic time & place: colonial kenya and a
19th century scandinavian village. in both cases, the director has
imagined and brought to life a time & place different from his own.
