rolex launches at least one high-end watch a year, albeit with a very low profile. i edited this article a bit because i used the term "f-you watch" without properly explaining it to all the audience. the term is often used by certain watch collectors and is not an insult to anyone who makes or wears a clone rolex watch. it's an interesting way to explain how a person's state of mind works when they choose a high-end product.
