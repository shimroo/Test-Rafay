welcome!





since 1990, original design huppah has been custom-designing one-of-a-kind, artistic huppahs, tallitot, torah covers, ark curtains, bris pillows and chairs, family trees, and other wall hangings for individuals, couples, and synagogues around the world. these are all handcrafted from a variety of specially-selected fabrics in your choice of colors and textures. designs can be elegantly simple or lavishly appointed with beads, jewels, metallics fabrics, and decorative stitching.
from precious keepsakes and family heirlooms to temple treasures, margery and eli langner are artists who have the privilege to act as the conduit between the need for ritual objects and the successful performance of hiddur mitzvah, the beautification of those objects.
our work can be seen in homes and synagogues on five continents. we ship all over the usa and all over the world!
phone: (520) 749-8111  (this is a landline and cannot receive texts.)
