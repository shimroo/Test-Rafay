kim potter dog training, berkshire, uk


• ever had the feeling that your precious dog is doing just as it wants rather than what you want it to do?
• let me show you how to be the pack leader so that you will be confident with the knowledge that you can both control and protect your dog.
• your dog needs to fit in with your lifestyle. this starts with his good behaviour in your home, in preparation for good behaviour outside.  the first introduction to young children and household cats requires advance planning and patience!
• i can guarantee that you and your dog will both become more relaxed and gain more enjoyment from your time together.
• please just phone me to discuss your concerns.  if i can help you over the phone, i will.

happy dog owner marcia says: "kim came to our home after we had rescued an american bulldog.  from the start we gained instant results. 
she is not only gifted in her understanding of dogs but of people too!  we now have a very happy boy who has settled into our family life. 
 kim is always on hand for any follow up questions or concerns that we have and i have no hesitation in recommending her as a dog trainer."
