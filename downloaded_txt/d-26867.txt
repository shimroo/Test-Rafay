american merchant marine at war - revolution to world war ii to today










american 
          merchant marine at war
dedicated to 
          the mariners who died in service of their country during all wars, including 
          revolutionary war, world war ii, korea, vietnam; and their u.s. naval 
          armed guard shipmates 



"[mariners] 
          have written one of its most brilliant chapters. they have delivered 
          the goods when and where needed in every theater of operations and across 
          every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult and dangerous job ever 
          undertaken. as time goes on, there will be greater public understanding 
          of our merchant's fleet record during this war [world war ii]."
