japanese aesthetic: wabi and sabi





japanese mini dry landscape garden , a photo by trudeau on flickr."wabi-sabi is the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of traditional japanese beauty and it occupies roughly the same position in the japanese pantheon of aesthetic values as do the greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the west," says wikipedia. "if an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be wabi-sabi."[2]"wabi-sabi nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect."[3]wabi now connotes rustic simplicity, freshness or quietness, and can be applied to both natural and human-made objects, or understated elegance. it can also refer to quirks and anomalies arising from the process of construction, which add uniqueness and elegance to the object. sabi is beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its patina and wear, or in any visible repairs.

the ancient silk road and china





silk road and china, a photo by trudeau on flickr.slaves, perfumes, spices, medicines, jewels, glassware: the silk routes (collectively known as the "silk road") were important paths for cultural, commercial, and technological exchange between traders, merchants, pilgrims, missionaries, soldiers, nomads and urban dwellers from ancient china, ancient india, ancient tibet, persian empire and mediterranean countries for almost 3,000 years.[5] it gets its name from the lucrative chinese silk trade, which began during the han dynasty (206 bc – 220 ce), says wikipedia.extending 4,000 miles, the routes enabled people to transport slaves and luxuries such as silk, satin, hemp and other fine fabrics, musk, other perfumes, spices, medicines, jewels, glassware and even rhubarb, as well as serving as a conduit for the spread of knowledge, ideas, cultures, zoological specimens and some non indigenous disease conditions[6] between ancient china, ancient india (indus valley, now pakistan), asia minor and the mediterranean. trade on the silk road was a significant factor in the development of the great civilizations of china, india, egypt, persia, arabia, and rome, and in several respects helped lay the foundations for the modern world. although the term the silk road implies a continuous journey, very few who traveled the route traversed it from end to end. for the most part, goods were transported by a series of agents on varying routes and were traded in the bustling markets of the oasis towns.[6]

chinese manufacturing advancing rapidly: geely's gleagle panda





2010 geely's gleagle panda, a photo by hugo90 on flickr.few in the us know about the chinese auto companies. once these companies were experts at "knocking off" western car models. they could make a fake bwmw  and sell it for half price. or a fake jeep or honda. today companies like geely motors are less copycats and more independent. recently the swedish car company volvo was purchased by geely, indicative of the chinese company's strength.
