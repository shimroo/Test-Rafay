welcome
this is a photographic record with a personal
  commentary of some of the plants seen during the annual excursions
  into the countryside of an amateur field botanist. at first when the site started in 2004, the focus
  was entirely on wild flowers growing in mainland britain  hence the domain name of the web
  site: ukwildflowers.com
  the aim was to share photographs of wild plants with anyone interested and particularly with those
  who no longer could make difficult trips up steep mountains or on long treks. but there seemed no good
  reason to exclude the photos of wonderful wild flowers found in ireland, continental europe or australia
  so the web site has gradually expanded to accommodate these new regions. ireland means the whole island
  and australia means mostly western australia, one of the world's botanical hot spots. europe though
  is an extremely loose definition which includes the canary islands, turkey and even the russian caucasus.
  there are a few fungi, some birds and quite a few butterflies also illustrated as well as scenery from
  wild flower trips.

the extensive indexing of the site is intended
  to help those wishing to identify a plant, where it can be
  found or the time of flowering. all species can be found from
	indexes on this first page but there are special indexes for european plants alone, australian plants
  alone and plants of britain and ireland alone. there are two all encompassing indexes, one in text
  only which will load quickly and one with thumbnail photos which is more useful but which will load
  much more slowly. in addition it is possible to move through all the european plants for example, without
  returning to the main indexes. see guidance in the about section.
you can find 1,584 photos
  of british isles wild plants including many native rarities on the
  site. wild plants includes both native species and introduced. the criterion for "wild flower" is
  that it hasn't been planted. over half the british and irish flora is introduced but the native or
  introduced status is indicated on each page.
 some photographs were taken at meetings
  organised by the wild flower society. if you are beginning
  to take an interest in british wild plants then why not join? (wild
  flower society). the wild flower society is one of the oldest societies in the world dedicated
  to the wonder of wild flowers, established as it was in 1886 with its name unchanged. you can find
  out out more of what we do on our facebook page.

use of photographs
photographs on the site have a resolution
  of 72 dpi which is only suitable for web use. if you ask for
  permission to use a photograph the answer will invariably be
  yes. there are no charges but please ask and read the contact
  me page for details. 
screen resolution and images
if your monitor delivers a low resolution e.g. 800 x 600 pixels not all the pages
  will work well because the plant photos are a fixed size. thumbnail images on plant pages can be expanded
  if only you must have scripts enabled in your web browser.
