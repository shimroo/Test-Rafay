on demand session
course value:  0.1 asha ceus; 1.0 md hours
speakers:  christina royster, edd, ccc-slp and courtney overton, ms, ccc-slp
course description: according to a demographic profile of asha (american speech and hearing association) constituents, only 8% of practicing speech-language pathologists (slps) indicated that they identify as a person of color. the result of this demographic phenomenon is that there are often profound communication breakdowns and cultural disconnects between therapists and the students, clients, and patients they treat, as well as families and caregivers. this session will discuss implicit bias, cultural and linguistic diversity, and culturally-sustaining assessment practices. finally, the session will share ways and resources to help diversify the field of speech pathology
learning objectives:
at the conclusion of this course, a participant should be able to:

identify current demographics and barriers to entry in the speech-language pathology (slp) field and ways to diversify the field.
define implicit biases and determine their impact on the assessment process of culturally and linguistically diverse individuals.
describe the most responsive assessment practices for diverse populations, including dynamic assessment and culturally-responsive standardized measures.

dr. christina royster, courtney overton and dr. christina royster along with dr. ana-maria jaramillo, formed divercity slp in 2018 after various experiences that reminded them of the lack of diversity in the speech pathology field. they first began with presentations to local high schools to spread awareness about the field and to provide mentorship to students interested in pursuing a communication science major. divercity slp's mission has expanded to provide professional development on various cultural topics.

**refunds are unavailable after registration materials are received.**
