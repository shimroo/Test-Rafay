it is always possible to adopt a child from another country, even if you live in the united states. children under 18 adopted from a hague convention country entering the u.s. with an ih-3 visa may automatically receive u.s. citizenship.
children adopted from a non convention country must qualify as orphans before receiving u.s. citizenship. when u.s. citizens finalize an adoption abroad, they must apply to the uscis for an ir-3 visa for the child. an ir-3 visa classifies the child as an immigrant and provides the child with citizenship upon arrival in the states.
parents wishing to receive a state birth certificate for their child must submit a validation or readoption of a foreign adoption to a state court.
