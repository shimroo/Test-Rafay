it‚Äôs a wonderful feeling when someone believes in you. when you are totally accepted and loved. the practice of deborah‚Äôs meditations has helped me accept and believe in myself. a gift that keeps on growing. my fears change to love and appreciation for myself and others. there is a beauty and magic happens practicing the meditations. my heart opens to new possibilities.building and strengthening new patterns that nurture me with compassion, joy, peace, trust, abundance and gentleness. i am truly grateful for the meditations. the practice keeps me grounded and in balance, lighting up my path and showing me another way.i have shared the meditations with many clients, friends and family and they,too, feel amazing.
