the safety of our guests and team members at blue marlin cove is a top priority. we have provided the thousands of our faithful guest and staff alike with helpful guidelines and safety information provided by the world health organization (who), u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and bahamas mistry of health detailing how to identify covid-19 symptoms and mitigate its transmission. we have also partnered with chemtron, as our exclusive suppliers, to provide our properties with access to top industry-standard cleaning and disinfecting supplies and have made training available to support our facility and our staff and managed owned condos in achieving the highest standards of cleanliness, disinfection and hygiene.
our mission is to make resort travel possible for all, and that becomes especially important during times of uncertainty. our cancellation policies for direct bookings are among the most flexible in the hotel/resort industry, with hundreds of guests already who have found our facilities honoring no-fee cancellations.
we have enhanced our policies as follows:
for bookings made online at www.bluemarlincove.com using our booking platform, guests are advised to contact all bahamas and us authorities directly to confirm all current and up to date laws and local requirements directly along with blue marlin cove policies. please consult travel advisories and information made available by the world health organization, u.s. centers for disease control and prevention and the u.s. department of state.
we will continue to closely monitor the situation and adapt our policies accordingly.
additionally, due to the current situation with coronavirus, our staff are implementing new processes to protect the safety of our guests and team members. this may result in a reduction in certain services and amenities that are normally available at our resort. those traveling to property and surrounding areas are asked and required to comply with all local guidelines and restrictions and may be required to provide identification establishing that they are âproperly cleared travelers.â if guests have questions or concerns, we ask them to please contact the local bahamas government agencies to obtain all proper and current information directly as our onsite and offsite teams cannot and will not confirm any rapidly changing guidelines which could cause a delay in you stay with us.
we thank you for your continued patience as we navigate with you to give you the best island time trip!

grand bahama island experience
welcome to the place where your dream getaway begins and the rest of the  world ends.


welcome to a resort where the world is a little different. an island  where colors are more intense and breezes more seductive. a tropical paradise  where endless blue sky dips into the bottomless blue caribbean â where you know  not where one begins and the other ends.
welcome to grand bahama and blue marlin cove, a true island experience where your worries, your responsibilities and your everyday life slip away. welcome  to a sport-fishing dream, where you can captain from florida to paradise  in just an afternoon. (big boat? no problem! we accommodate up to 70-foot  boats.)


welcome to an exclusive, family-friendly resort and eco-friendly vacation â a true home-away-from-home with everything you need to glide  effortlessly from your everyday reality into life in paradise.
welcome to this, the  authentic and real bahamas â a hidden  gem on the west end of grand bahama island, just far enough from the glitter  (and pulsating cruise crowds) of bustling freeport and lucaya. it’s a whispered  promise of laidback, island hospitality and gracious bahamian charm. a haven  for first-time visitors and longtime guests. 


welcome to our grand bahama island hotel
