why 
			griffin and spalding county?
 
            close enough to the metropolis of atlanta for easy access to 
			hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport (and therefore the 
			world), yet far enough away to offer small-town charm, 
			griffin-spalding county is the choice location for industry.
 
            fiber optic cable keeps our industrial community in touch with the 
			world around the clock; interstate 75 offers convenience; rail lines 
			serve manufacturers who must move freight quickly; and the landscape 
			makes for a relaxing drive to and from work. who could ask for more?
 
            the griffin-spalding development authority invites you to take a 
			tour and see for yourselfwe can meet your needs on any level. and 
			we take business very seriously.
