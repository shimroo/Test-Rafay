about fpo 



established in 1991 



foster pet outreach is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. we are an all volunteer organization whose mission is to save and improve the lives of companion animals by connecting people, resources and knowledge.  we rescue and rehome animals from high intake, low adoption shelters where they are at risk, as well as private home situations where an animal can no longer be cared for.when you volunteer with foster pet outreach, you make a difference for homeless animals and for the people who love saving them.we were founded in 1990 when three coworkers banded together to help a stray cat. recognizing the need to better the lives of abandoned and abused animals in their community, they eventually formed foster pet outreach in 1995. over 300 animals are placed into loving homes each year by our organization.foster pet outreach has always had a commitment to making a difference in the lives of unwanted animals.our building in edwards, illinois does not house animals. all animals are in foster homes.  our ability to change lives is directly dependent on the number of volunteers and foster homes available. if you want to help save animals while having fun with a group of like-minded people, we hope you’ll join us.  we have a  facebook volunteer group page that has details about upcoming events that you can request to become involved with.
