about


current owner, manager, and alto singer shaye smith is the granddaughter of original alto anna (âeffieâ) carter and of howard gordon, who played deft and discreet electric and acoustic guitar for the chuck wagon gang in the 1950s and â60s.
in todayâs chuck wagon gang, smith is joined by long-time soprano melissa kemper, tenor josh garner, guitarist nick poe, and bassist cody shaneyfelt.

over eighty years of hope, harmony, faith and family.


when farmer d.p. âdadâ carter formed the group in 1935, with son, ernest, and daughters lola and effie, he could not have conceived of pbs documentaries, or of fan letters from presidents. dad was simply looking for a way to spread the good word, and a way to buy medicine for effie, who was sick with pneumonia.
that story, and this music, has moved johnny cash, merle haggard, charlie daniels, and generations of gospel singers and open-eared listeners. for more than eighty years, the chuck wagon gang has offered hope and harmony, faith and family.
