james clary1939 - 2018jim clary’s love of the sea formed in his youth near the detroit river where his desire to draw the passing vessels was born. while still a young boy his family moved to the rural town of richmond, michigan, where he would spend much of his time exploring the st. clair river in st. clair, a small town just south of port huron. as he grew, his interests in painting and collecting bits and pieces of maritime history would deepen and evolve into a profound union of historical accuracy and artistic detail — the trademark characteristic that made him famous.his renown among maritime museums and private collectors around the world afforded him many adventures. among them the 1983 expedition which located the titanic, the 1994 edmund fitzgerald expedition, the 1997 carl d. bradley expedition, trips on many great lakes freighters, a hook landing on the aircraft carrier uss enterprise, and a reenactment of the deck fight aboard old ironsides, the uss constitution, to name just a few. these and countless other experiences, treasured conversations, and thousands of hours researching long-forgotten legends and mysteries are captured in a lifetime of artwork. his contribution to the legacy of the great lakes and maritime history lives on.
