mary iselin’s paintings are luminous and filled with light. she paints draft horses, sheep, cattle and landscapes the way some artists would paint a bowl of fruit: to explore light, color, and atmosphere—especially spiritual atmosphere.
a professional painter in oil, iselin is represented by several fine art galleries, including 3 pears in dorset, vt; vermont artisans in brattleboro, vt; and hannah grimes in keene, nh. she is the recipient of numerous awards, has been featured on rural heritage tv, and is collected both in this country and abroad. she is a former faculty member of the nh institute of art. and, on a light note, last year she received the gold award for “best artist” in both local newspapers!
“the longer i paint, the more i feel that the point is to just keep painting. techniques can be learned, but it is my job as an artist to be standing there with a paint brush in my hand when inspiration comes through. and painting is all i really want to do.”mary iselin’s paintings are luminous and filled with light. she paints draft horses, sheep, cattle and landscapes the way some artists would paint a bowl of fruit: to explore light, color, and atmosphere—especially spiritual atmosphere.
