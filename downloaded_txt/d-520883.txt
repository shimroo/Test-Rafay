roots
we say roots because almost every mx, sx, bmx, car-racer, mountain-bike racer, road racer etc… a hero or (not so hero) started out riding a honda 50, from there they moved to bigger and better things! …did they really? most of them kicked themselves after they sold their prized 50. usually they did so, only because they got too big to ride them. the fun never diminished, just the size of the 50 as they grew physically.
after years when one becomes successful or not so successful, they become grounded and go back to their "roots". most adults are now buying the honda 50’s for their children. should the kids be the only ones to have fun? we think not… that is why we decided to make high performance parts for late model and even some of the early model z50 and xr50’s
