we still have some of the updated version (v3) of the classic "aluminum ast". these air separator tanks feature 
a billet filler neck for a reliable, positive seal. the updated design improves the separation of air bubbles from 
the coolant by creating a "swirl" effect inside the tank. they are black powder coated for a durable finish and also available in raw aluminum.
