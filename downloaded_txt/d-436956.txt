programs, education, and designations
as a member-run organization, our educational offerings are created, developed, and administered by those who know the subject best, other ipt members.  the organization offers schools that cover specific state and local tax disciplines, including property tax, sales & use tax, state income tax, value added tax, and credits & incentives. to create a more comprehensive learning experience, we also host an annual conference, yearly discipline-specific symposiums, industry-focused seminars, and webinars. we carefully craft each program to meet our members’ needs. ipt’s highly regarded cmi designation is the most widely respected salt achievement available for those specializing in sales & use, property, or state business income taxation, and the ccip designation is the first to recognize excellence for those working in the credits & incentives field.
