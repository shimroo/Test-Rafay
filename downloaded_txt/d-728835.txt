“small and busy sunday farmers market, but it is super nice to meet the vendors and get to know a few of them. good for lunch as well with multiple options for food, tacos, gyros and bbq all good. small selection of produce and meat vendors but generally everything i am looking is available. to fill in gaps there is a new seasons market next to the farmers market making it easy to pickup a few last items for the week.”

“great place to happen upon on a sunday afternoon. i didn't know they held a market here. great vendors. lots of local seasonal vegetables! plenty of food vendors as well! wasn't to crowded, but perhaps because we were catching the tail end of it. i will be back to see next week's options and plan to be there earlier and bring more cash... i hope to see you there!”
