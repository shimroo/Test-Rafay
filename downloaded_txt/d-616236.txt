petal pushers










i am super excited to introduce you to the freshest addition to my stitched up line of journals... 

flower power.


inspired by the timeless florals of marimekko my flower power designs which have previously been available at craft shows on notecards and cushions are now available on moleskine journals. each vibrant layer is handcut, color matched, glued, and stitched up by me. the color combinations are endless and i never tire of dreaming up new petal palettes.




journals are available in pocket and large sizes {3.5" x 5.5" and 5" x 8.25"} and are now available in the shop. please allow up to one week to ship. pick some fresh flowers today! 



which colors will you choose?

where did punk rawk purl go...?






i apologize for being completely mia for the past few months. to be completely up front... it has been a rough time for punk rawk purl (&amp; for tammy too). but i assure you that i have been smiling each and everyday and continue to be grateful for the unlimited possibilities that each day brings. 



i have been working quietly in the studio on a couple of new designs (pictured below) as well as taking on some entirely new projects as well... mostly photography related. {i have discovered great passion and solace in the ever expanding world of mobile photography. the creativity, friends, and freedom i have developed through this art have been integral to my endurance these past few months.}




i hope to be posting more regularly and am working on some updates to the shop. as always, custom orders are welcomed. if you don't see something that you that perhaps you saw at a craft show please feel free to ask, i would love to create something special just for you. 




many thanks, hugs and lots o' love to all of you who have reached out and contacted me to check in. ❤

it's knot your fault...





when i saw the ever awesome ashley of after nine to five tweet about a bloggy photo contest... my eyes got super big, and my heart was all a flutter.  thank you ashley and misty for hosting such a fabulous contest!

i spent a couple of hours on sunday at the long ago closed alameda point naval base. it is a dreamland of decrepit buildings, shipyards, debris, tumbleweeds, and pure abandoned wonder. i snapped tons photos of battle ships, air control towers, even the sun shinning down on the san francisco bay, and my favorite shot of the day was this rope. pure texture heaven.



it's knot your fault...








i shoot photos all day, every day. all of my photography {or iphoneography} is taken and edited entirely on my iphone.  if you would like to see more of my photos, you can check out my instagram account. i also post a few to flickr.

have a snap happy day!

i have stitched it up again... this time with dem dry bones.  all of the boney pieces and parts are meticulously cut out by hand and machine stitched onto a morbidly cute colorful background. i then stich the artwork onto the cover of a moleskine journal.
there are 5 colors and 2 page styles to choose from::cauldron black •  putrid pink •  blood red •  nightshade navy •  menacing mustard grid or lined pages
available now in my etsy shop... go get 'em before they get you first! 
i am curious to know.... trick-or-treat, old-timey poison bottles, or yo ho ho ho....
for you, is the skull & crossbones motif more associated with pirate or halloween themes? leave me a comment below, telling me where your mind travels to when you see this skully-boney icon.
