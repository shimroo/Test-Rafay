gilmore ½ watt  recording amplifier
the gerhart gilmore was designed, from the bottom up, as a “real deal” 
guitar amp.  this is not a toy.  this is not a mass produced chinese pos.  
this amp plays like a big one, but at volumes that won’t have the cops 
banging on your home studio door.  back in the day, you just plugged the 
guitar in and turned the thing up.  this is that sort of amp.  you really 
haven’t played anything like this, at this volume.  seriously.
volume, treble, middle, bass, presence
3 12ax7 tubes for the preamp and phase inverter.
cathode follower before the tonestack
6n1p dual triode as push-pull power amp
custom designed transformers by mercury magnetics
.125 thick g10 turret board
completely hand wired -- no printed circuit boards
aircraft aluminum chassis
birch ply cabinet
choice of vinyl colors
