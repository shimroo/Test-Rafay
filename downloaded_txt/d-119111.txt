        a note to my happy trails visitors: 

welcome to my happy trails website. these stories, mostly 
          about fun and educational adventures with kids, were written as a way 
          to share field trip ideas with the homeschooling (and larger!) community. 
          they were originally written for two charlottesville area homeschool 
          support group newsletters and one statewide organization, the organization 
          of virginia homeschoolers. i homeschooled my three children 
          between 1990 and 2006. that means these articles are dated. please understand 
          that i keep the website available for visitors looking for inspiration 
          and you should always check the facts as you plan your own journeys!
happy trails,
          mary alissa wilson
