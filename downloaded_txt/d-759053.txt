great views and great stews the views of the lake and the birds eating outside the windows of the restaurant /store is breathtaking. the food is what you would expect at a high dollar downtown restaurant, but at half the price. the catfish stew is the best we have enjoyed in a long time. the shrimp and grits were a delightful, nicely priced meal. highly recommended for fisherman and families.

great people and great atmosphere for a full service fish camp you can't get much better on santee cooper. blacks camp is not the ritz but it's not suppose to be. the lodging is there to give you a good place to lay your head and relax so you can sleep and get up early and get on the water. you are literally right on the water with the boat ramp right there. everyone is very friendly and the fishing guides are top notch. after a day of fishing you can have your catches cleaned and cooked in the restaurant for a very nice added bonus.

amazing weekend getaway premier accommodations and food for the santee area been a while since i'd stayed at blacks camp. the motel rooms had had some up keep done. the restaurant is fantastic overall in my opinion. of all the santee cooper destinations, this is the premier place to stay. plenty of parking for your truck and boat, decent boat ramp, good view, and peaceful to say the least. after 4 days fishing, i wish i were still there. if you need any thing, just ask, any the staff would be glad to assist.
