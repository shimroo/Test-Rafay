back in the 1890′s goldfield boasted 3 saloons, a boarding house, general store, blacksmith shop, brewery, meat market and a school house. just when it looked like the town would outgrow mesa, the vein faulted, the grade of ore dropped and the town died a slow painful death.
after several unsuccessful attempts to reopen the mines, the town did come to life again from 1910 on and off until 1926. after more than 115 years, travelers from all over the world still visit this gold mining town located on the historic apache trail and enjoy the excitement and grandeur of arizona’s wild west!
