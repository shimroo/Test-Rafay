2024 tulsa holiday winter circuit update.
all of the photos are posted; photos cost $9 each for a full-size digital image.
the metal panels and poor lighting made it difficult to take photos in the ford truck arena, so i didn't shoot much in there.
the password i posted at the 2024 tulsa holiday winter circuit will work for the other events, too. my thanks to all you who bought photos, and god bless you in 2025.
photos from both of the 2023 tulsa holiday circuit shows, are also available on my smugmug site for a nominal cost of $1 each. i moved them from my other website because of problems viewing/downloading the photos.
have a merry christmas!
