a legacy of graceequipping every generationgen z and gen alpha aren’t just the future church, they’re part of our church today!









we’re committed to investing and equipping our kids and students to know and love god, and to be active contributors to our church family.




our focus is on guiding younger generations toward a lifetime of following jesus. while we have fun, our main goal is spiritual formation in a relational environment.
