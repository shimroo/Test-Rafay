prime ministers with a mission - part ii
23 september 2023, 5:57 am

g20 summit held in india has addressed several issues very successfully. vasudev kutumbkam meaning ‘one earth one family one future’, was the theme of the summit; it should be the motto of all beings on this earth. african union has been included in the summit for the first time. many countries unanimously signed documents on so many issues; despite differences on ukraine issue, there was 100% consensus on new delhi declaration; global biofuel alliance has been made. india-middle east-europe economic corridor will be developed. ‘sabka saath sabka vishwaas’ -has become a global mantra now. india plays a major role, a decisive role on the world pedestal now.  read more...















prime ministers with a mission - part i
23 september 2023, 4:31 am

some periods become periods of pride for the nation. the last month has been such a period of achievement and recognition for our country. space programs have brought glory to india. with chandrayaan-3 landing on moon successfully on 23 aug 2023, india becomes the first nation to land on southern side of moon. the whole nation watched the landing while our hearts swelled with pride. aditya-l1 has been launched on 2 sep 2023 effectively and we have to wait for some months to see the results. india running the vimshottari dasha of moon-venus, both dasha lords placed in the third house of travel and communication, taking us to moon, towards sun, is marvellous indeed.   read more...















guru purnima – a day of salutations to the guru
16 july 2022, 7:02 pm

who is a guru? he is the one who draws our attention away from the dross and towards the sublime. he helps the disciple see the bigger picture, of which the physical plane is just a little part. even when he is not changing anything materially, he gives us the wisdom of acceptability on the physical plane. and he is doing it not for one but so many of his disciples who come to him.   read more...















massacre of innocent children in usa
6 june 2022, 1:48 am

for whatsoever the reason, the killing of children can’t be justified. now, the past week has been an anxious one for our friends and family in usa due to multiple shooting incidents. where is usa heading with all the school shootings! killing in a spurt of anger, just because one is in ready possession of a gun, killing without any rhyme or reason; when such indiscriminate shootings stop and the bigger question is that when will the gun issue be handled.  read more...

afghanistan's history of invasions (v) 
7 january 2022, 6:27 pm

how is it that afghanistan invaded india so many times and afghanistan was not attacked as many times. when theft is committed, it is committed in the rich man's house. india has always been known to be a very rich country whereas it was not the case with afghanistan. when afghanistan is not a rich country, where is the question to invade it?  read more...















islam in afghanistan (part iv)
26 november 2021, 4:50 am

well, the caste system was duly prevalent in india. in the times of ashoka the great, after the massive war and numerous deaths in kalinga; ashoka, full of remorse took comfort in the religion of non-violence viz. buddhism. buddhism spread far and wide in the indian subcontinent (as discussed in third part in our series of articles on afghanistan). but, if the whole society becomes buddhist, where are the fighters to defend the nation? afghanistan and sind, two frontier provinces of india, all turned buddhist, with no kshatriyas to fight and protect the nation. with afghanistan and sind, depleted of fighters, there was no one to save the nation against the invasion by invaders.  read more...















buddhism in afghanistan (part iii)
23 october 2021, 4:56 am

vedic philosophy got too complex; many rituals had turned to superstitions. discontent had creeped in the society. at that time, an apparently simpler religion came up; it was buddhism. gautam buddha brought about buddhism; which comprised of by and large the same hindu rules but in a loose accommodating setting. the need for mediator between god and man was questioned at that time, there was little use of a priest.  read more...

withering away of congress party 
19 september 2019, 3:18 am

is ours an ideal democracy!! hardly so, it is far from being an ideal democracy; where there should be  two equal opponents, like conservative and labour party in britain; like republican and democratic party in usa. as for india, for the two major parties here i.e. congress and bjp there has never been a state of relative equilibrium. there was a time when congress was all powerful for a long time, bjp had not come into existence then. bjp came into existence and gradually spread its wings and the status now of present election result on 23 may 2019 is that bjp alone bagged 303 seats and 353 seats along with its nda alliance. congress on the other hand could muster only 52 seats; along with upa, congress got 91. other parties won 98 seats. what to talk of equality, congress party could not win even 55 seats which is the requisite 10 % to become the official opposition. read more...

fear of world war iii
10 january 2020, 1:29 pm

what is happening between usa and iran is not a world war but it may develop into a major war and may be later into a world war. what we must always remember is that after the end of second world war in 1945, there have been at least three regional wars every ten years; mostly asian and african countries have been involved whereas usa and russia have made lots of profit by selling arms and ammunition.  read more...
