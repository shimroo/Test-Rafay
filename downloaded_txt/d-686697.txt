our current workforce system is flawed. 



we’re here to change that. we know that jobs rarely serve the people they should, and that many of our existing policies are rooted in racism. we also know that everyone has potential—the potential to lead their own unique pathway out of poverty, and the potential to help others do the same.chicago jobs council is uniting community and institutional leaders to rebuild the system, to create jobs that work for people, and to dismantle policies that only serve some.we’re putting in the hard work because we know it counts. and we’re guiding our community to lasting prosperous economic and employment outcomes for all.
