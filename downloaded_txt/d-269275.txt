	 lyn's last blog post
	 
    
it's not that i
haven't enjoyed this one--it's that i haven't been writing as lyn cash for a
while. therefore, i'm killing the blog and moving to another one, where i hope
you'll join me if you're of a like mind. this one is to be about a writer's
journey…yours, mine, somebody else's. readers who know me as bobbie cole should
recognize me, as should friends who know me as sunny.



hope to see you
there on march 1st. god bless.

	 quick trip 2 am
	 
    
ever had donut cravings in the middle of the night? well, here's what it'll get ya. son & dil sent me in for a donut run, and there were 4 of the cutest kids horsing around in quick trip, taking photos of one another, just having fun. old gal here got pulled into one of them. so here's a shout out to marshall (to my left) and pat (to my right)...and a hello to the girls, kelsey and...ack...i've forgotten a name. but hopefully one of them will see the blog and let me know. sorry!
pat, if i understood, just won a state championship in wrestling. wow. having moved from stillwater, oklahoma a few years ago (hello...wrestling hall of fame), i can appreciate the hard work and dedication that takes.
i haven't talked to anyone their age for that long since i last taught in college. should i put these kids in a book, or what?! maybe once i get back from australia. 
hawt guys and their incredibly sweet girl friends...not what i'd expected to find when i walked through those doors, but i'm glad i did. they made my day.

	 happy holidays
	 
    
merry christma, happy hanukkah, and everything else you celebrate. i haven't dropped off the planet, just been busy, then sick, holidays, writing, the usual. i've mailed my packages, haven't filled out a single christmas card but at least did the packages. everything here will be rather low key during the winter holidays, but...more on what's coming up in another post.

for now, just let me announce that my harlequin carina press romantic suspense is now in paperback and was selected for harlequin's reader services, meaning it is available in paperback for anyone who goes to the site. if anyone is interested, it's here (and i've forgotten how to do the hidden link thingie, sorry): http://www.harlequin.com/storeitem.html?iid=25028

color me happy. *smile*

again, all the best for a marvelous holiday.

hey! two live ones - lol.liz, believe it or not, i shall be in hawaii with lex or in australia with her during rt in 2012. since 2011 was such a rotten year for her, and since she has no books debuting any time soon, she asked (and i'd have been an idiot not to accept) me to join her for a girls' holiday. we plan on taking in a luau, maybe seeing the dole pineapple planation, a macadamia nut farm, pearl harbor, etc in hawaii then going to oz for some excursions and colloborations on new books. we haven't had anything we've done jointly out in a while. i miss you, too!!!linda, thank you, my friend (miss i-have-an-eppie nomination for 2012!!!)... you're a sweetheart for stopping by. merry christmas and happy new year to you as well!

	 i confess...
	 
    
literally. we writers are such weird sorts anyway. i'd forgotten i'd submitted this, but i did, a few months ago. while flitting back and forth from this male/male novel to that romantic suspense, a girl gets squirrely and has to write something "different". i not only made the sale, but my story is the lead one. title in the upper left corner. july issue, on the stands now. *grin*

have a good day, everyone. more later...

	 say hello to hunter raines!
	 
    

i've been a slug on my own blog, and i don't have anything wonderful to say about myself today, but i promise to have a new post up soon with at least something funny or interesting soon. for now, if you would, pop over to cash cole's blog and read a humorous interview hunter raines has done with one of the characters from paradise found. = )
http://cashcole.blogspot.com/

	 i need to take a class on tweeting.
	 
    
but if i can't make it to my blog, i'm wondering...why bother? ya know? how do those of you who tweet, and update facebook and my space do this? i get so bogged down with the should haves in a writer's life that every now and then i have a grade a, homogenized meltdown if the media aspect detracts me from my writing.
that said, tptb at harlequin are right. my romantic suspense that debuted monday was #5 that day for sales. i have no way of knowing for sure whether the tweets they did and the facebook promo is the cause or if it's simply that several people were waiting or surprised that i'd gotten off my butt and had a book out. but...i'll give h's marketing strategies the kudos. 
i took a leave of absence from my life a while back. was rather interesting. i came to the conclusion that i was doing too much of what didn't feed my soul. the results? i made a commitment (yes, another one) to quit smoking. oh, bite me. i can do this. i also refrained from critiquing anyone else for several weeks until i had a come to jesus meeting with my muse, who kicked my whiny ass. 
* * *therefore, i've also been writing my buns off. short stories, 1st chapter of a new women's fiction, a male/male romance or two. should have news in a bit on a couple of submissions. one debuts next week. ack. another launch day.
* * *i'm amazed at my friends who put up with my obnoxiously harsh critiques of their own work. i do not derive pleasure from those. i simply want them to put forth their best effort when they submit, but i take things too far. i try keeping that thought in mind whenever they blast away at my work. color me shocked that they still want me back after my self-imposed exile. 
* * *
i'm equally astonished if they like something and publicly say so. lol. gretchen jones did a review of memories of you and posted this to amazon. my humble thanks to her. 
i'm looking forward to spring weather, not just the calendar telling me that the snow we're to get tomorrow is actually during spring. maybe i just need to adjust my attitude a little further before gearing up for bbq weather, sandals, and sunny dispositions. maybe the weather has nothing to do with my snarky 'tude.
then again...maybe it does. 
hope your week has gone well. 
sunny bob the industrious

your critiques are always welcome woman, but i understand the frustration.  i'm looking at my calendar and wondering "am i ever going to have time for myself?"  so, i really like your additude.  maybe it will rub off???oh, and on the tweeting thing, get an app for your phone.  makes it a lot easier.  i've tweeted more since i've gotten the app than i did in the last year!
