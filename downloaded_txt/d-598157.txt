announcementswelcome to the avon valley railwayopened in 1869 by the midland railway as a through-route between birmingham and the south coast the line was later linked to the iconic somerset & dorset railway.  closed under the beeching axe of the 1960's the avon valley railway was preserved by an enthusiastic group of volunteers.  today, 50 years on, three miles of track has been re-laid, locomotives and carriages restored, and the sound of steam can once again be heard along the avon valley.
