"rocky retreat is gorgeous! having rented quite a few cabins in the tahoe 
area, i felt this to be by far the best appointed, cleanest, and most nicely 
decorated.... gail, the manager, was also quite a pleasure to do business 
with - unfailingly attentive and helpful. i highly recommend this spot."

"there were only 3 of us, and although the home accomodates many more people, it never felt too large."
