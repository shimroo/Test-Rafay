geopolitics of capitalism





  
                  state of power 2025
            



           state of power
         



          geopolitical rivalry is reshaping our planet as reactionary nationalists take power and global tensions mount. our 13th state of power report explores whether this is the end of us imperialism and the beginning of a chinese empire, the way nationalism is reshaping neoliberal globalisation, and the implications of a shifting global order for the vast majority of the world and for social movements fighting for justice.

tni achieved important progress in 2023 toward the equitable, democratic and peaceful world we envision. at the policy level, we celebrated more nails driven into the coffin of one of the biggest barriers to climate action – the energy charter treaty and its investor protections; and put a critique of green colonialism squarely on the public agenda. we continued to publish cutting-edge analyses to challenge the growing menace of digital capitalism, and advocated for ending the moratorium on taxation of transnational e-commerce. in response to the juggernaut of militarism, with a particular focus on the endless war in ukraine and the israeli decimation of palestine, we offered vitally important counter-narratives helping to shift public opinion more in favour of peace. we drew the connections between securitisation and a number of key issues, from drug policy to migration to climate change, and proposed more just and equitable approaches. with our proposals and counter-narratives, we reached impressive audiences around the world.
