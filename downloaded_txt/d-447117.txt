 we are one of the largest, and the oldest texas chapter, of the nar
				 (national association of rocketry.) operating since 1972, we have been promoting sport and hobby
				 rocketry throughout the dallas-fort worth metroplex nonstop for over 50 years. while launching/flying
				 rockets is our primary activity, our presence also reaches out into the community in other ways.

              	 our outreach programs work with the scouts, ymca, 4h, as well as many local schools and educators,
				 to encourage the next generation of texans to pursue their interest in science, math, aerospace
				 or engineering. and, kids always fly free!

              	 the general public is always welcome to attend any of our launches, bring your rockets and join
				 in the fun. our members will help you fly everything, from the smaller estes and quest model rockets
				 up to custom built high-power rockets reaching altitudes in excess of a mile.

              	 so if you're interested in rocketry, contact us and we'll be happy to introduce you to the hobby. 
or check out our calendar and stop by the next event.
 
 


















the picture above is of a scale model saturn-v vehicle from the apollo missions. flown by warren benson (of houston) at a dars launch,
				   the kit is from apogee rockets and is 1/70 scale.  it flew successfully on the core aerotech g-64
				   motor (even though the four outboard estes e-9 motors failed to ignite.)

       this is still cool!

watch this very-well-made-video  
			  of a dars monthly launch, showing the people side of model rocketry. 
			  it wonderfully highlights the fun we find in the hobby. 
			  thanks to cap'n kris kirk (one of the team amick dads.) good work indeed!

sat.feb.15 canceled! gunter launch rained out! 
     we had wind and cold cancel the launch sat.jan.18, and we also had to canel sat.jan.25  
     and now this weekend is also too wet to fly. 
     (actually we could maybe fly from boats, but not cars or trucks.)   
     so, sat.feb.15 is canceled too!
another bummer!
     let's hope that the 'special' launch scheduled for next weekend sat.feb.22 will work out better.

     tarc special launch scheduled.
     dars wants to give our local american rocket challenge teams a launch opportunity to make up for the weather-canceled january gunter event.
this special launch is scheduled for february 22, on the 4th saturday of the month.
tarc teams take note!!! there are only four scheduled dars launch events for you to get your required qualification 
     flights completed.  be there if you can!   
     and do not forget the normal february gunter launch on sat.feb.15.  it is also tarc friendly     
     see ya' at the gunter launches!

now canceled! gunter launch for january 
     we had postponed the launch from sat.jan.18, to this weekend sat.jan.25> but this weekend is just as bad.
so, we are canceled! for this month completely. 
bummer ! ! !
     see you in gunter, maybe next month?

     another pair of good launches.
     our november launch in gunter was more busy than expected. tarc, scouts and rocket enthusiasts of all ages showed up and flew rockets.
     a slightly damp pasture, with lots of cow-pie land mines, but great for launch and recovery. many rocket challenge teams making test flights, and some still
     "just watchin" shows that the remaining launches before april will be eventful.  weather permitting, we have 4 gunter launches to get in the practice and 
     official qualification flights.  no time to waste. 
     our december arlington launch happened before the month's meeting.  and wow; it was busier than most.  the winds were from the exactly wrong direction for 
     this flying site. but, they we so light as to be a non-issue.  almost a hundred flights for the day, or so it seemed.  
     christmas and new year's coming fast.. fly'em if you got them.

     a launch at gunter
     we actually had a nice launch at gunter last month (october.)  the field was in great shape, and the weather cooperated.
     a very well behaved crowd, lots of fun... but watch, our next launch is still weather watched.

!! we had a launch !!
     on sunday in arlington on oct.06 
     it turned into a great day to launch, but we caught out a few flyers by starting at 10am instead of our summer hours 8am.
     many flyers, many rockets.  and we had a rocket launch!!!


colin's first rocket!...

     -- -- 2024-10-13 -- -- 
arlington launch will happen!
 for sunday oct. 6th.
     the burn-ban is lifted, weeds may be high or dry, but let's try to fly! {grin}
     hours of launch operation have reverted to the non-summer times of 10am to 2pm.  come on down!
     --fly'em safe! 
     
       -- -- 2024-10-04 -- -- 
burn bans around botharlington and gunter launch sites.

     many counties in north texas have enacted burn bans due to the dry, hot and windy conditions. both grayson county (where gunter is)
     and tarent county (arlington) are under burn ban declarations.  
     this is usually a good indication that the launch field conditions are bad.
{remember... hot, dry, windy...}
     we do not want to start fires with our activities and risk our site permissions. so launches are on hold until the area conditions improve. 
     stay tuned for updates, both this website and the facebook page will try to stay up-to-date.
     but the best way to get the latest updates is through the push-notification from the dars forum.
(see how to join, below the pictures in the middle column!)

temperature trouble 
sometimes in texas the summer is hot ! 
(under-statement with sarcasm. but true.}
     this month the expected temperature on launch day is well over 100degf with a heat advisory in effect.
     along with that the humidity values are measured in the 'disrespectful' range by our tv weather guys.
     the high school football teams are even staying indoors to practice. 
     so the dars will also take precautions.
     this month 'summer wins a round.'  we will not launch in gunter this saturday.  we don't think it makes good sense to give our set-up and take-down crews heat stroke. 
     use the time for family, or hobbies...
     maybe build some new rockets for future launch dates.   
     ---stay cool!
