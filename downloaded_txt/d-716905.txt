	 anyone wanna go pee?
	 
    
i know that finding a washroom in london or any major city can be a hard thing to find but surely this goes one step too far...wc1 is the place to be and be seen in london. it is the first time hanging out and powdering your nose are being promoted together. us men know that women often "go" together so i suppose this is just some form of coming out celebration.
