safety
        tips while investigating and evaluating 
        black mold and moisture problems



do not touch black mold or moldy items with bare
            hands. 
do not get toxic mold or mold spores in your
            eyes. 
do not breathe in toxic mold or black mold
            spores. 
consult a professional for personal protective
            equipment (ppe) and containment guidelines. 
consider using ppe when disturbing toxic mold.
            the minimum ppe is an n-95 respirator, gloves, and eye protection. 








 here are
        the solutions
the answers...


solid natural hard wood

made with 100%
        stainless steel 
        (less likely to corrode)

2 heavy duty ceramic plates included
        with purchase (less likely to break)

ionizer in front of fan
        
        (unobstructed, stronger ionization)

roller ball bearing
        (quiet, longer lasting operation)

modular chassis (slides
        out for easy cleaning)

o3
        production 
        (eliminates odors, breaks down mold and mildew)

ionization (removes airborne
        particulate)

if you see mold in your
          home, everyone agrees you should get rid of it. but experts say in
          most cases there is no need to have expensive mold remediation done.
          they advise homeowners to stop the water intrusion at the source and
          to clean up the mold with a bleach. but what about the mold spores in
          the air and that awful smell?

why are we concerned
    about mold? small amounts of
    mold growth in workplaces or homes (such as mildew on a shower curtain) are
    not a major concern. but no mold should be allowed to grow and multiply
    indoors. large quantities of mold growth may cause nuisance odors and health
    problems for some people. in addition, mold can damage building materials,
    finishes, and furnishings and, in some cases, cause structural damage to
    wood.

    current news about the effects of mold
    and mildew.
molds are part of the natural
    environment. mildew growing outdoors can appear on many surfaces such
    as on firewood, logs, tree trunks, forest floors, etc. outdoors, mildew play
    a part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves
    and dead trees, but indoors, black mold growth should be avoided.  they
    reproduce by means of tiny spores; the spores are invisible to the naked eye
    and float through outdoor and indoor air.  it may begin growing indoors
    when spores land on surfaces that are wet.  there are many types of
    spores, and none of them will grow without water or moisture
