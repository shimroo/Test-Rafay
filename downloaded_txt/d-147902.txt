walking barefoot
the whole world is a sacrament that points us to the reality of god.   everywhere we place our foot is holy. when we look with the eyes of   faith, god shows himself in our lives and in our world in ways both   powerful and quiet. this song is from our album by the same name, walking barefoot.




 

there is always joy!
paul’s letter to the jesus believers at philippi
(bite-sized studies through the book of philippians)
    by jeff doles

paul was in prison. the jesus believers at philippi were  facing increasing persecution. add to that an undercurrent of personal  disagreements and division in the fellowship, and things were not looking very  bright. yet paul said, “rejoice in the lord always.” there is always joy, and in his letter to the church at philippi, paul shows us how to find it.
joy saturates this letter. it shows up in unexpected  turnarounds in the midst of difficult circumstances. it is found in knowing  jesus in his humble, self-giving servanthood, in the power of his resurrection â and  even in the fellowship of his suffering. it is discovered as together we pursue  the jesus-shaped life. more ...
 

the focus of our faith
paul’s letter to the jesus believers at colosse
(bite-sized studies through the book of colossians)
    by jeff doles

when you have the proper focus, 
  
  you can see things clearly
 focus is important. the better your focus, the more clearly  you can see. but it is important that your focus be on the right thing because  your direction will follow your focus. when your focus is clear and on the  right thing, then you will be heading in the right direction.
 the gospel of our faith is the good news that the kingdom of  god has come and jesus is the messiah, god’s anointed king. he is the focus of  our faith â not only the one upon whom we fix our attention but also the  one through whom we view the whole world, to see more clearly and  understand god’s purpose with greater wisdom. that is what paul’s letter to the  jesus believers at colosse is about. more ...
 

personal confessions from the psalms
prayers and affirmations for a life of faith, happiness and awe in god
renew your heart to the rhythms of god!
 the psalms of the bible are powerful expressions of the  heart of faith in covenant with god, and of the heart of god in covenant with  his people. confessing the psalms is simply speaking in agreement with them,  and is a great way to meditate on, personalize and instruct your soul with the  truths and promises they bring.

the personal confessions in this book are adapted from the  psalms. they are defibrillations to shift your heart into the rhythms of faith,  to recalibrate your thoughts and emotions with the promises of god and realign  your will with the heart of god. but don’t just read them. find a place where  you can say them out loud and maybe even shout them out with passion. let them  go up with a whoop and a holler to god, with the velocity of faith, and watch  what happens in your heart and in your life. more ...
