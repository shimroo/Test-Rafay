great prices, everything all in one place!
when i tried to compare your prices to the prices on other sites, i found that they were pretty good, but what was more interesting is that i would need to buy the same products from three different sites, if i didn’t buy they all from you. great selection . . .thanks

beautiful balusters!
i don’t know why anyone would buy balusters anywhere else. they’re beautiful, obviously solid and installed great. my contractor says that he’ll be using you again.

repeat customer
while i am the builder in the family, my wife has been nick named the internet scavenger for the kind of deals that she is able to turn up. we have now flipped over twelve homes in the past 8 years, all valued at over $500,000.00. since we found crown-molding.com, we have saved literally thousands of dollars in mill-work and columns. on our most recent project, the best that [my wife] could find for columns and balustrade alone was going to cost us about $60,000.00. crown-molding.com supplied these for $44,670.00 and two weeks sooner than anyone else could. we just sold the house for $873,500.00 with more in our pocket thanks to you. you will be hearing from us again very soon.
