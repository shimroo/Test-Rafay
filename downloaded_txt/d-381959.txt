biostar z890 valkyrie lga1851 motherboard review

motherboards/intel lga1700
				by stefan
                @ 2025-02-16
read/post comments(0)


				the z890 valkyrie board from biostar does incorporate a solid hardware design, with 22 power phases, a ton of m.2 slots for storage expansion, a new ez release feature for the gpu slot which was not present on the x870e valkyrie, heatsinks with captive screws, dual lan (2.5gbit and 5gbit), usb 4.0 type-c, but also an easy-to-use uefi interface.				read more








crucial pro overclocking 32gb (2x16gb) ddr5-6400 white kit review

memory
				by stefan
				@ 2025-02-09
read/post comments()


				the new crucial pro overclocking kits with a rated speed of 6400mt/s do perform great and are very compact for accommodating any cooling system, no matter how big it is. the overclocking term is not placed in the product name for nothing: in our tests we could raise the speed up to 6800mt/s and noticed a performance boost in most apps, while maintaining the same timings and operating voltage. this way, the modules only got warm during high stress tests so it would function in smaller chassis without any issues, where airflow is not always ideal.				read more







aqirys m32 wireless gaming mouse review

others/mice & keyboards
				by stefan
				@ 2025-02-01
read/post comments(0)


				after customizing a bit m32 settings via the supplied software, we tried it in dead island 2, tom clancy’s the division 2, the first descendant and diablo 4. the mouse did track without any issues and we really enjoyed the low weight and the smooth surface of the chassis, but also the lack of rubberized components which usually wear down quickly and collect lots of skin oils and lint.				read more







razer blackwidow v4 pro 75% mechanical gaming keyboard review

others/mice & keyboards
				by stefan
				@ 2025-01-26
read/post comments(0)


				the blackwidow v4 pro 75% felt very satisfying when gaming in titles such as dead island 2, the division 2, throne and liberty or smite 2. it feels very responsive even in wireless mode, while the sound of bottoming out is silent enough not to disturb other gaming pals located in the same office. we have also used the keyboard for productivity work such as writing review documents, browsing the web, video editing and the oled screen looks like a nice addition, with plenty of configuration options.				read more







silicon power px10 1tb usb 3.2 gen 2 external ssd review

storage/ssd
				by stefan
				@ 2025-01-19
read/post comments(0)


				px10 usb 3.2 gen2 drive from silicon power does look great and performs really well without throttling even during long write workloads thanks to the aluminum chassis which does also act as a heatspreader. we noted the top area of the heatsink becomes quite hot after a while, telling us the thermal transfer is done as needed, while the bottom plastic cover makes sure the drive remains light during transport (only 33 grams).				read more







crucial 32gb (16gbx2) ddr5-6400 cudimm memory kit review

memory
				by stefan
				@ 2025-01-12
read/post comments(0)


				despite the high latency of c52, the ddr5-6400 cudimm kit from crucial does trade punches with the silicon power pulse c30 ddr5-6000 dimm kit we have reviewed just some time ago, which is a great thing to see for a memory running at a such low voltage! during our testing, the memory remained cool all the time so are definitely recommended to be installed in systems with less-than-ideal airflow as well.				read more
