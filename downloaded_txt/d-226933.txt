 "we just returned from our 5 night stay at creekwood farm rv resort and had a amazing time. we stayed on a site right next to the creek and the view was beautiful. the site was spacious, clean, and practically level. the bathrooms were immaculate (cleaned three times a day) and the staff were so friendly and helpful. the entire place was quiet and restful. this is the nicest privately owned rv park we have ever stayed in. i highly recommend staying here if you are looking to access the smokies or asheville, it's a wonderful place."lauren m. - google reviews"we have enjoyed our stay here, the park is clean and the views are beautiful. my kids love riding their bikes around the park and playing at the creek. there is plenty do/see in the area and it is a short drive the great smoky mountains. we would 100% recommend this place to anyone!"shelby c. - google reviews"creekwood farms was amazing! no highway noise, well kept grounds, large clean bathrooms, very helpful staff, and creek sites are wonderful to sit & relax next to after a look day hiking. everyone is welcome, large or small rv's. along with the live band saturday evening, everything was perfect. nearby activities: hwy 40 is minutes away. and the blue ridge parkway is approx. 20 minutes south."phillip b. - google reviews"my husband and i stayed at site 59 on the river with our friends staying site 60. beautiful location, enjoyed the sound of the river. ladies in the office were very warm and welcoming, all the employees were great. bathroom and bathhouse very clean and were great. we enjoyed our stay so much we booked another stay for summer which was filling up fast and i see why. we will come back for sure. great place!"lyn s. - google reviews
