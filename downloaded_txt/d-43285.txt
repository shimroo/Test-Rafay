flying in and out!
working on some new quilt designs. beading alas, has taken a back seat for a  while. i have added a few shows this year, it's a chance to see and purchase my exclusive bead retreat kits and see the art i'm now creating in fabric. it's been wonderful adventure combining my drawings with beautiful fabrics into art applique designs.
come see            me at...
