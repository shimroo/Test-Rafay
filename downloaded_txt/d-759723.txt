connecting your channel to your audience
use our infrastructure, expertise and long-standing network of partners to reach your audience.









the way television is delivered is changing fast
 broadcast still plays a major part in news and sports, but audience groups watch television differently. in the meantime, ott and vod is fast becoming the preferred way to view tv series and films. looking to the future, we think social media will play a prominent role in reaching younger audiences. we are active in all three areas, helping our customers stay relevant as we move forward.

linear
linear remains the dominant way that people watch television shows and sports.

ott
ott has seen huge growth in recent years, especially for television series and films.

social
social is the method of choice for younger audiences, and will only continue to grow.

big enough to deliver, small enough to care
our customers love working with us because of our size. many have migrated from larger, corporate service providers because they felt invisible and ignored. they had to put up with structures that were rigid, inflexible and slow.
we are not preoccupied with trying to build a global empire through endless acquisitions. we aspire to do more of what we love – broadcast and television, excellent service delivery and seeing our customers achieve their objectives.

agile, independent and london-based
we manage more than 60 channels from our state-of-the-art facility in west london. our cloud-based suite of software under the absolute brand has become one of the most praised broadcast and content management tools in the business.
flexibility is our mantra, and this is the most important factor why our customers stay with us. we invest for the long term – we don’t need to chase the valuation game or worry about our next investment round. we attract the best talent because we love what we do and it’s infectious!


about us







 abs delivers across 200+ platforms
our strength is our interconnectivity, networks and relationships we have nurtured over decades with platforms, channels, teleport and providers. each relationship is a piece of a puzzle to complete the tapestry of tv, broadcast and global distribution.
