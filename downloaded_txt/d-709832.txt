                creating the customer experience category




 


qualtrics is a single system of record for all experience data, also called x-data™, allowing organizations to manage the four core experiences of business—customer, product, employee, and brand experiences—on one platform. over 8,500 enterprises worldwide, including more than 75 percent of the fortune 100 and 99 of the top 100 u.s. business schools, rely on qualtrics. 
 
we led qualtrics’ $150m series b round in 2014 and co-led their $180m series c round in 2017. we were thrilled to help them celebrate their $8b acquisition by sap in 2019. along the way, we supported the company with pricing advisory as they pivoted from a survey tool to a customer experience platform, and changed the industry.
