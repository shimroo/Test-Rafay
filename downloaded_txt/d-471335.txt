or worse?






  with trembling fingers
  despite the worst foreign policy blunder in american history, george w. bush
  and his millionaire supporters don't know the meaning of the word shame.

  by hal crowther   durham independent weekly   may 12, 2004 
http://indyweek.com/durham/2004-05-12/news.html

  i used to take a drink on occasion with a network newsman famed for his 
  impenetrable calm -- his apparent pulse rate that of a large mammal in deep 
  hibernation -- and in an avuncular moment he advised me that i'd do all right, in the 
  long run, if i could only avoid the kind of journalism committed to the 
  keyboard "with trembling fingers." i recognized the wisdom of this advice and 
  endeavored over the years to write as little as possible when my blood pressure was 
  soaring and my face was streaked with tears. the lava flows of indignation 
  ebb predictably with age and hardening arteries, and nearing three-score i 
  thought i'd never have to take another tranquilizer -- or a double bourbon -- to 
  keep my fingers steady on the keys. 

  i never imagined 2004. it would be sophomoric to say that there was never a 
  worse year to be an american. my own memory preserves the dread summer of 1968. 
  my parents suffered the consequences of 1941 and 1929, and my grandfather 
  jack allen, who lived through all those dark years, might have added 1918, with 
  the flu epidemic and the great war in france that each failed, very narrowly, 
  to kill him. drop back another generation or two and we encounter 1861. 







but if this is not the worst year yet to be an american, it's
the worst year by far to be one of those hag-ridden wretches 
who comment on the american scene. the columnist who 
trades in snide one-liners flounders like a stupid comic with a
tired audience; tv comedians and talk-show hosts who try to
treat 2004 like any zany election year have become grotesque,
almost loathsome. our most serious, responsible newspaper
columnists are so stunned by the disaster in iraq that they've 
begun to quote poetry by rupert brooke and wilfred owen. 
they  lower their voices; they sound like army chaplains delivering eulogies over  ranks of flag-draped coffins, under
a hard rain from an iron sky.  
yeats' "blood-dimmed tide is loosed." the war news has already
deteriorated from bad to tragic to pre-apocalyptic, which leaves
no suitable category for these excruciating reports on the sexual 
torture of iraqi prisoners. fingers, be still. in less than a year, the
morale of the occupying forces has sunk so  low that murder, 
suicide, rape and sexual harassment have become alarming 
statistics, and now the warriors of democracy -- the emissaries
of civilization --  stand accused of every crime this side of 
cannibalism. osama bin laden has  always anathematized america's culture, as well as its geopolitical influence.  






to him these atrocities are a sign of allah's certain favor, a great moral   victory, a vindication of 
his deepest anger and darkest crimes. 

  where does it go from here? the nightmare misadventure in iraq is over, 
  beyond the reach of any reasonable argument, though many more body bags  
  will be filled. in washington, chicken hawks will still be squawking about "digging in" 
  and winning, but vietnam proved conclusively that no modern war of occupation 
  will ever be won. every occupation is doomed. the only way you "win" a war of 
  occupation is the old-fashioned way, the way rome finally defeated the 
  carthaginians: kill all the fighters, enslave everyone else, raze the cities
  and sow  the fields with salt. 


  otherwise the occupied people will fight you to the last peasant, and why 
  shouldn't they? if our presidential election fails to dislodge the crazy bastards 
  who annexed baghdad, many of us in this country would welcome regime change 
  by any intervention, human or divine. but if, say, the chinese came in to 
  rescue us -- operation american freedom -- how long would any of us, left-wing or 
  right, put up with an occupying army teaching us chinese-style democracy? a 
  guerrilla who opposes an invading army on his own soil is not a terrorist, he's a 
  resistance fighter. in iraq we're not fighting enemies but making enemies. as 
  richard clarke and others have observed, every dollar, bullet and american 
  life that we spend in iraq is one that's not being spent in the war on 
  terrorism. every iraqi, every muslim we kill or torture or humiliate is a precious shot 
  of adrenaline for osama and al qaeda. 

  the irreducible truth is that the invasion of iraq was the worst blunder, the 
  most staggering miscarriage of judgment, the most fateful, egregious, 
  deceitful abuse of power in the history of american foreign policy. if you don't 
  believe it yet, just keep watching. apologists strain to dismiss parallels with 
  vietnam, but the similarities are stunning. in every action our soldiers kill 
  innocent civilians, and in every other action apparent innocents kill our 
  soldiers -- and there's never any way to sort them out. and now these acts of 
  subhuman sadism, these little my lais. 

  since the defining moment of the bush presidency, the preposterous 
  flight-suit, fox news-produced photo-op on the uss abraham lincoln in front of the 
  banner that read "mission accomplished," the shaming truth is that everything has 
  gone wrong. just as it was bound to go wrong, as many of us predicted it would 
  go wrong -- if anything, more hopelessly wrong than any of us would have dared 
  to prophesy. iraq is an epic trainwreck, and there's not a single american 
  citizen who's going to walk away unscathed. 

  the shame of this truth, of such a failure and so much deceit exposed, would 
  have brought on mass resignations or votes of no confidence in any free 
  country in the world. in japan not long ago, there would have been ritual suicides, 
  shamed officials disemboweling themselves with samurai swords. yet up to this 
  point -- at least to the point where we see grinning soldiers taking pictures 
  of each other over piles of naked iraqis -- neither the president, the vice 
  president nor any of the individuals who urged and designed this debacle have 
  resigned or been terminated -- or even apologized. they have betrayed no 
  familiarity with the concept of shame. 

  thousands of young americans are dead, maimed or mutilated, xxx billions of 
  dollars have been wasted and all we've gained is a billion new enemies and a 
  mouthful of dust -- of sand. chaos reigns, but in the midst of it we have this 
  presidential election. george bush has defined himself as a war president, and 
  it's fitting that the war should be his undoing. but even now the damned polls 
  don't guarantee, or even indicate, his demise. 

  conventional wisdom says that an incumbent president with a $200 million war 
  chest cannot be defeated, and that one who commands a live, bleeding, 
  suffering army in the field is doubly invincible. by this logic, the most 
  destructively incompetent president since andrew johnson will be rewarded  
  with a second term. that would probably mean a military draft and more wars 
  in the oil countries, and, under visionaries like dick cheney and paul wolfowitz,  
  a chance forthe usa to emulate 19th-century paraguay, which simultaneously 
 declared war on  brazil, argentina and uruguay and fought ferociously until 90%  
  of the male population was dead. 

  what hope then? impeachment is impossible when the president's party controls 
  both houses of congress, though watergate conspirator john dean, who ought to 
  know, claims in his new book that there are compelling legal arguments for a 
  half dozen bills of impeachment against george w. bush. peer pressure? at the 
  white house, world opinion gets no more respect than fbi memos or 
  uncomfortable facts. many americans seem unaware that scarcely anyone on
  the planet earth supported the iraq adventure, no one anywhere except the 40-50
  million republican loyalists who voted for george bush in 2000. 

  among significant world leaders he recruited only great britain's tony blair 
  -- whose career may be ruined because most britons disagree with him -- and 
  the abominable ariel sharon, that vile tub of blood and corruption who recently 
  used air-to-ground missiles to assassinate a paraplegic in a wheelchair at the 
  door of his mosque. (palestinians quickly squandered any sympathy or moral 
  advantage they gained from this atrocity by strapping a retarded 16-year-old 
  into a suicide bomber's kit. such is the condition of the human race in the 
  middle east, variously known as the holy land or the cradle of civilization.) says 
  sharon, oleaginously, of bush: "something in his soul committed him to act 
  with great courage against world terror." 

  the rest of the known world, along with the united nations, has been dead set 
  against us from the start. but they carry no weight. thanks to our tax 
  dollars and the well-fed, strong but not bulletproof bodies of our children -- 
  though mostly children from lower-income families -- george bush and his lethal 
  team of oil pirates, cold warriors and likudists commands the most formidable 
  military machine on earth. no nation, with the possible exception of china, would 
  ever dare to oppose them directly. 


  but the chinese aren't coming to save us. nothing and no one can stop these 
  people except you and me, and the other 100 million or so american citizens who 
  may vote in the november election. this isn't your conventional election, the 
  usual dim-witted, media-managed mister america contest where candidates vie 
  for charm and style points and hire image coaches to help them act more 
  confident and presidential. this is a referendum on what is arguably the most dismal 
  performance by any incumbent president -- and inarguably the biggest mistake. 
  this is a referendum on george w. bush, arguably the worst thing that has 
  happened to the united states of america since the invention of the cathode ray 
  tube. 

  one problem with this referendum is that the case against george bush is much 
  too strong. just to spell it out is to sound like a bitter partisan. i sit 
  here on the 67th birthday of saddam hussein facing a haystack of incriminating 
  evidence that comes almost to my armpit. what matters most, what signifies? 
  journalists used to look for the smoking gun, but this time we have the cannons 
  of waterloo, we have gettysburg and sevastopol, we have enough gunsmoke to 
  cause asthma in heaven. i'm overwhelmed. maybe i should light a match to this 
  mountain of paper and immolate myself. on the near side of my haystack, among 
  hundreds of quotes circled and statistics underlined, just one thing leaped out at 
  me. a quote i had underlined was from the testimony of hermann goering at the 
  nuremberg trials, not long before hitler's vice-fuhrer poisoned himself in 
  his jail cell: 

  "... it is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a 
  democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. 
  voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the 
  leaders. this is easy. all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, 
  and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to 
  danger. it works the same in every country." 

  goering's dark wisdom gained weight when a friend called me and reported that 
  vice president cheney was so violently partisan in his commencement speech at 
  westminster college in missouri -- so rabid in his attacks on john kerry as a 
  anti-american peace-marching crypto-communist -- that the college president 
  felt obliged to send the student body an email apologizing for cheney's 
  coarseness. 

  if you think it's exceptionally shameless for a man who dodged vietnam to 
  play the patriot card against a decorated veteran, remember that georgia 
   republicans played the same card, successfully, against sen. max cleland, 
  who suffered multiple amputations in vietnam. in 2001 and 2002, george bush
  and his machiavelli, karl rove, approved political attack ads that showed the 
  faces  of tom daschle and other democratic senators alongside the faces of
  saddam hussein and osama bin laden. and somewhere in hell, goering and
  goebbels toasted each other with a schnapps. 
 am i polarized? i've never been a registered democrat, i'm sick of this 
  two-party straitacket, i wish to god it didn't take yale and a major american 
  fortune to create a presidential candidate. the only current democratic leaders  
  who show me any courage are nancy pelosi and old bob byrd -- hillary clinton  
  has been especially cagy and gutless on this war -- and john kerry himself may 
  leave a lot to be desired. he deserves your vote not because of anything he ever 
  did or promises to do, but simply because he did not make this sick mess in 
  iraq and owes no allegiance to the sinister characters who designed it. and 
  because his own "place in history," so important to the kind of men who run for 
  president, would now rest entirely on his success in getting us out of it. 

  kerry made a courageous choice at least once in his life, when he came home 
  with his ribbons and demonstrated against the war in vietnam. but sen. kerry 
  could turn out to be a stiff, a punk, an alcoholic, and he'd still be a colossal 
  improvement over the man who turned paul wolfowitz loose in the middle east. 
  the myth that there was no real difference between democrats and republicans, 
  which i once considered seriously and which ralph nader rode to national 
  disaster four years ago, was shattered forever the day george bush announced his 
  cabinet and his appointments for the department of defense. 

  i'm aware that there are voters -- 40 million? -- who don't see it this way. 
  i come from a family of veterans and commissioned officers; i understand 
  patriots in wartime. if a spotted hyena stepped out of air force one wearing a 
  baby-blue necktie, most americans would salute and sing "hail to the chief." 
  president bush cultivated his patriots by spending $46 million on media in the 
  month of march alone. somehow i'm on his mailing list. (is that because my late 
  father, with the same name, was a registered republican, or can bush afford to 
  mail his picture to every american with an established address?) twice a week i 
  open an appeal for cash to crush john kerry and the quisling liberal 
  conspiracy, and now i own six gorgeous color photographs of the president and his 
  wife. i'm sure some of my neighbors frame the president's color photographs and 
  fill those little blue envelopes he sends us with their hard-earned dollars. 

  i struggle against the suspicion that so many of my fellow americans are 
  conceptually challenged. i want to reason with my neighbors; i want to engage 
  these lost americans. what makes you angry, neighbor? what arouses your 
  suspicions? does it bother you that this administration made terrorism a low priority, 
  dismissed key intelligence that might have prevented the 9/11 catastrophe, then 
  exploited it to justify the pre-planned destruction of saddam hussein, who 
  had nothing to do with al qaeda? all this is no longer conjecture, but direct 
  reportage from cabinet-level meetings by the turncoat insiders richard clarke 
  and paul o'neill. 

  if the pentagon ever thought saddam had "weapons of mass destruction," it was 
  only because the pentagon gave them to him. as kevin phillips recounts in 
  american dynasty, officials of the reagan and first bush administrations eagerly 
  supplied saddam with arms while he was using chemical weapons on the kurds. 
  they twice sent donald rumsfeld to court saddam, in 1983 and 1984, when the 
  dictator was in the glorious prime of his monsterhood. 

  this scandal, concurrent with iran-contra, was briefly called "iraqgate," 
  and, yes, among the names of those officials implicated you'll find most of the 
  engineers of our current foreign policy. (they also signaled their fractious 
  client, saddam, that it might be all right to overrun part of kuwait; you 
  remember what happened when he tried to swallow it all.) does any of this trouble 
  you? does it worry you that dick cheney, as president of the nefarious 
  halliburton corporation, sold iraq $73 million in oilfield services between 1997 and 
  2000, even as he plotted with the wolfowitz faction to whack saddam? or that 
  halliburton, with its ceo's seat still warm from cheney's butt, was awarded unbid 
  contracts worth up to $15 billion for the iraq invasion, and currently earns 
  a billion dollars a month from this bloody disaster? not to mention its $27.4 
  billion overcharge for our soldiers' food. 

  these are facts, not partisan rhetoric. do any of them even make you 
  restless? the cynical game these shape-shifters have been playing in the
   middle east is too byzantine to unravel in 1,000 pages of text. but the hypocrisy
  of the white house is palpable, and beggars belief. if there's one american who 
  actually believes that operation iraqi freedom was about democracy for the poor 
  iraqis, then you, my friend, are too dangerously stupid to be allowed near a voting 
  booth. 

  does it bother you even a little that the personal fortunes of all four bush 
brothers, including the president and the governor, were acquired about a half 
  step ahead of the district attorney, and that the royal family of saudi 
  arabia invested $1.476 billion in those and other bush family enterprises? or,
 as paul krugman points out, that it's much easier to establish links between the 
  bush and bin laden families than any between the bin ladens and saddam hussein. 

  do you know about ahmad chalabi, the administration's favorite iraqi and 
  current agent in baghdad, whose personal fortune was established when he 
  embezzled several hundred million from his own bank in jordan and fled to 
london to  avoid 22 years at hard labor? 

  that's just a sampling from my haystack. maybe i can reach you as an 
  environmentalist, one who resents the gutting of key provisions in the clean air act? 
  my own orange county, n.c., chiefly a rural area, was recently added to a 
  national register of counties with dangerously polluted air. you say you vote for 
  the president because you're a conservative. are you sure? i thought 
  conservatives believed in civil liberties, a weak federal executive, an inviolable 
  constitution, a balanced budget and an isolationist foreign policy. george bush 
  has an attorney general who drives the aclu apoplectic and a vice president who 
  demands more executive privilege (for his energy seances) than any elected 
  official has ever received. the president wants a constitutional amendment to 
  protect marriage from homosexuals, of all things. between tax cuts for his 
  high-end supporters and three years playing god and caesar in the middle east, 
  george bush has simply emptied america's wallet with a $480 billion federal deficit 
  projected for 2004 and the tab on iraq well over $100 million and running. 

  "a lot of so-called conservatives today don't know what the word means," 
  barry goldwater said in 1994, when the current cult of right-wing radicals and 
  "neocons" had begun to define and assert themselves. goldwater was my first 
  political hero, before i was old enough to read his flaws. but his was the 
  conservatism of the wolf -- the lone wolf -- and this is the conservatism of sheep. 

  all it takes to make a bush conservative is a few slogans from talk radio and 
  pickup truck bumpers, a sneer at "liberals" and maybe a name-dropping nod to 
  edmund burke or john locke, whom most of them have never read. sheep and sheep 
  only could be herded by a ludicrous but not harmless cretin like rush 
  limbaugh, who has just compared the sexual abuse of iraqi prisoners to "a college 
  fraternity prank" (and who once called chelsea clinton "the family dog" -- you 
  don't have to worry about shame when you have no brain). 

  i don't think it's accurate to describe america as polarized between 
  democrats and republicans, or between liberals and conservatives. it's polarized 
  between the people who believe george bush and the people who do not. thanks to 
  some contested ballots in a state governed by the president's brother, a 
  once-proud country has been delivered into the hands of liars, thugs, bullies, 
  fanatics and thieves. the world pities or despises us, even as it fears us. what this 
  election will test is the power of money and media to fool us, to obscure the 
  truth and alter the obvious, to hide a great crime against the public trust 
  under a blood-soaked flag. the most lavishly funded, most cynical, most 
  sophisticated political campaign in human history will be out trolling for fools. i 
  pray to god it doesn't catch you.

key west literary seminar "spirit of place: american literary 
landscapes" 
january 10-13, 2002 back to list of panelists  january 10-13, 2002 
    http://www.keywestliteraryseminar.org/spirit/p_halcrowther.htm









panelist - hal crowther 

       hal crowther  was born in
       1945 in halifax, nova scotia,
       of southern-american parents.
       he is a graduate of williams
       college (ba, english) and the
       columbia university graduate
       school of journalism (1967).
       he was a media columnist and
       a film and drama critic for the
       buffalo news, staff writer at
       time and associate editor at
       newsweek, where he served
       as television critic and editor
       of the media section. he was
       also a columnist on film and
       media for the humanist and
       free inquiry magazines and a
       regular contributor to the book
       pages of the atlanta
       journal-constitution.


hal crowther january 10-13, 2002 






          in 1981 he began writing his syndicated column for spectator,
       where he was executive editor from 1986 - 1989. during the
       '90s the column originated in the independent weekly of
       durham. in 1992, it received the baltimore sun's h.l. mencken
       writing award, the first weekly column so honored. along with
       their decision, the judges delivered the following commentary:
       "like mencken, hal crowther has the narrowed pupil of a
       sharpshooter, the hairy ear of a heavy artilleryman, and the
       ballistic rifling of an implacable anathematist. mr. crowther
       steadies his weapon of choice; he draws a bead; blam! and
       one more target is left trying to wipe off the splatter of his
       true and accurate words." in 1998 it won another national
       award, the aan (american association of newsweeklies) first
       prize for commentary, shared with nat hentoff of the village
       voice.

       "dealer's choice," crowther's column on southern letters and
       culture, has been featured in the oxford american since 1994.
       he also writers a column for the progressive populist, out of
       austin, texas. a collection of his essays--unarmed but
       dangerous, with a foreword by annie dillard--was published in
       june 1995 by longstreet press. his current collection,
       cathedrals of kudzu, a personal landscape of the
       south--foreword by fred hobson--was published last fall by
       lsu press. nominated for the pulitzer prize and the national
       book award, cathedrals received the 1999-2001 fellowship
       prize for non-fiction from the fellowship of southern writers
       and the 2001 first prize for essays from foreword magazine,
       which named it a finalist for book of the year. in 2000
       crowther received the russell j. jandoli award for excellence
       in journalism from st. bonaventure university. his essays have
       been published in many anthologies, most recently novello:
       ten years of great american writing (2000), books of passage
       (1997), close to home (1996), cast a cold eye (1991), and
       the language arts textbook textures (1993). he has several
       screen credits for film and television scripts, and his radio
       commentaries have been carried on wkbw in buffalo, wptf in

electronically hijacking the world trade center attack aircraft? joe vialls october 2001
http://www.serendipity.li/wot/home_run.htm (1 of 4) [4/19/2004 11:15:57 pm]

prince turki al faisal, saudi ambassador to great britain, also the former
saudi intelligence chief who unexpectedly resigned twelve days before
september 11 on 31 august 2001, said today that america is a colonial power;
that all this stuff about democracy for iraq is horsefeathers; that the
(regrettably endlessly corrupt) abu ammar, chairman arafat, is a living
martyr.

it was prince turki who recruited the group that later became al qaeda to
fight the soviets in afghanistan from 1979 to 1989.   at war's end, prince
turki certainly didn't want the soldiers to come home to saudi arabia, so he
started paying the group $300 million a year to keep them elsewhere.  a
dozen years later, new york got the picture.

prince turki al faisal's remarks, impolitic by most standards, probably
advance the widely-held notion that one faction of the house of saud has
always utterly loathed the united states and considers americans to be
servants.

 northwoods project:
 exposing the pentagon's diabolical schemes
by ernesto cienfuegos
la voz de aztlan

los angeles, alta califronia - october 28, 2002 - (acn) la voz de aztlan has recently reported on our doubts that many of the terrorist attacks in the u.s. and around the world are the work of islamic fundamentalists, muslims or arabs. there is ample evidence that these terrorist attacks are actually being committed by certain rogue elements of the u.s. and israeli governments. in order to justify our doubts, we are making available to our readership below, the damning and shocking top secret "northwoods project" document that has been declassified and obtained through the freedom of information act. even though the project was written and approved by the joints chiefs of staff and approved by the secretary of defense to deal with cuba in 1962, the plan "fits like a glove" to what is presently occurring in the "war against islam."

the diabolical northwoods project's principal architect was the than chairman of the joint chiefs, zionist general lyman lemnitzer who many patriotic americans claimed was a jewish operative for israel. the evil nature of the plan is almost identical to those of ariel sharon's military command. the once "top secret" pentagon document, that can be accessed through our link below, will hopefully help wake up the american public.

the plan calls for, among other things, the staging of terrorist incidents that would provide "pretexts" and "justifications" to attack cuba. it outlined how cuba would first be "demonized" in the eyes of the world and in the eyes of the united nations. it is exactly the same script being utilized against iraq. it provided ways by which cuba would be seen as "rash", "irresponsible", "unpredictable", and a "threat" to the peace of the western hemisphere.

among some of the specific "staged" terrorist incidents the plan proposed were to "blow up" a u.s. ship in guantanamo bay and blame cuba, attack the u.s. guantanamo base with "fake" cubans, and use fake mig type aircraft piloted by u.s. pilots to attack us surface ships and passenger airlines. one proposal made by the northwoods project, and this may explain the "phantom" aa passenger airline that supposedly hit the pentagon on september 11, was to provoke the cuban government to shoot down a u.s passenger airline that the cia would substitute with a "drone." in addition, the plan called for producing u.s. citizen casualty lists in florida and washington d.c. that would be published in the media thus generating "indignation" by the american public.

saudi envoy, turki al-faisal: iraq war was 'colonial' and about oil
mon may 24, 2004 07:16 am et
dublin (reuters) - the u.s.-led invasion of iraq was a colonial war and
there were some in the united states who saw it as a means of getting their
hands on iraqi oil, a senior saudi ambassador was quoted as saying monday.
prince turki al-faisal, ambassador to britain and ireland, told the irish
independent newspaper washington's stated aims in going to war in iraq
masked a more cynical reality.
"no matter how exalted the aims of the u.s. in that war, in the final
analysis it was a colonial war very similar to the wars conducted by the
ex-colonial powers when they went out to conquer the rest of the world ...,"
prince turki said.
"what we have heard from american sources they were there to remove the
weapons of mass destruction which saddam hussein was supposed to have
acquired."
saudi arabia, a key u.s. regional ally, opposed the war despite tensions
with iraq since its 1990 invasion of kuwait.
"what we read and hear from our commentators in america and sometimes
congressional sources, if you remember going back a year ago, there was the
issue of the oil reserves in iraq and that in a year or two they would be
producing so much oil in iraq that, as it were, the war would pay for
itself," the envoy said.
" indicated that there were those in america who were thinking in those
terms of acquiring the natural resources of iraq for america." prince turki
said u.s. pledges to bring freedom and democracy to iraq remained "still
just aims."
"the individual iraqi, until he can actually declare that his government is
truly representative of his wishes and aspirations must still consider
himself occupied," he said.
on the wider conflict in the middle east, prince turki described palestinian
leader yasser arafat as "a living martyr," persecuted by an israel "that is
ruthless and generally devoid of any human considerations (toward the
palestinians)."
critics of saudi arabia, cradle of islam and the birthplace of osama bin
laden and 15 of the september 11 hijackers, have accused it of allowing
religious militancy to flourish.
the envoy described bin laden's al qaeda network as "not so much an
organization as a cult with a cult leader and a cult philosophy...."
"one of the main drawbacks of the operations in afghanistan is that bin
laden has not been caught," he said. "to bring bin laden to justice will go
a long way to removing some of his mystique."

on a more productive note, if that's the adjective in these early days of
asymmetrical world war:


sept. 11 families sue saudis, sudan
august 16, 2002

"we will succeed because we have the facts and the law on our side."
thomas e. burnett sr., father of sept. 11 victim

(cbs) -  some 600 relatives who lost loved ones in the sept. 11 terrorist
attacks have filed a $100 trillion lawsuit against the sudanese government
and saudi officials, banks and charities, claiming they helped finance osama
bin laden's network.

however, lead attorney ron motley said friday that the $100 trillion
complaint was being amended and would likely be scaled down asking for
damages in excess of $1 trillion in future filings.

"it's not the money. we want to do something to get at these people," said
irene spina, whose daughter, lisa l. trerotola, 38, died in the world trade
center in new york city. "there's nothing else we can do."

"this is the right thing to do," said matt sellito, father of matthew carmen
sellito, 23, who also died at the world trade center. "if the odds are
stacked against us, we will beat them."

the 15-count federal lawsuit seeks to cripple banks, charities and some
members of the saudi royal family as a deterrent to terrorist financing
schemes.

the suit was filed thursday in u.s. district court in alexandria, va., on
behalf of the families. the complaint charges the defendants with
racketeering, wrongful death, negligence and conspiracy.

motley said the money likely would come largely from assets held by the
defendants in the united states. he said the plaintiffs were after more
institutions than those whose assets already have been frozen by the u.s.
and other governments.

another attorney in the case, allan gerson, said friday that one aim of the
lawsuit was to choke off the financial support for terrorist networks.

"until now, sponsoring terrorism has been a cost-free operation," gerson
said on cbs news' "the early show." he said "we intend to stop that."

the lawsuit is likely to cause post 9-11 friction between the u.s. and saudi
arabia, reports cbs news chief washington correspondent bob schieffer.

the bush administration has been careful not to blame the saudi government
for the attacks in its drive to build a coalition for its war against
terrorism. but the relatives' lawsuit bluntly accuses saudi officials and
institutions of supporting terrorists.

"that kingdom sponsors terrorism," motley told reporters. "this is an
insidious group of people."

the complaint names more than seven dozen defendants, including the
government of sudan, seven banks, eight islamic foundations and three saudi
princes.

those listed include prince mohammed al-faisal, former intelligence chief
prince turki al-faisal, saudi defense minister prince sultan, khalid bin
salim bin mahfouz of the national commercial bank and the faisal islamic
bank.

officials from the saudi embassy did not return a call for comment.

prince saud al-faisal, the saudi foreign minister, said last week that the
70-year-old u.s.-saudi alliance was as solid now as before the sept. 11
attacks on the united states.

he said bin laden, who was stripped of saudi citizenship and is accused of
directing the al qaeda attacks, had intended to drive a wedge between the
two countries when he chose 15 saudi citizens to be among the 19 hijackers.

several plaintiffs, fighting tears, said they would dedicate the rest of
their lives to punishing those who financed the hijackings and crashes of
four u.s. commercial jets on sept. 11.

"we will succeed because we have the facts and the law on our side," said
thomas e. burnett sr., whose son, thomas e. burnett jr., led a passenger
revolt against the hijackers of united airlines flight 93 and died when it
plummeted to the ground in a southwestern pennsylvania field.

"we have justice and morality on our side," he added.

burnett's mother, deena, said her son told her in a phone call that he was
"putting a plan together that he and others were going to take back the
airplane."

"and he said, 'you know deena, i think we can do it. it's up to us,' she
said. "those words resonate in my mind. and i think we're going to do
something, too. and this is a good start."

nuclear waste redistributed by a global-warming tornado?  

independent.co.uk

'only nuclear power can now halt global warming' leading environmentalist urges

 radical rethink on climate change.

by michael mccarthy environment editor

24 may 2004

global warming is now advancing so swiftly that only a massive expansion of

nuclear power as the world's main energy source can prevent it overwhelming

civilisation, the scientist and celebrated green guru, james lovelock, says.

his call will cause huge disquiet for the environmental movement. it has

long considered the 84-year-old radical thinker among its greatest heroes,

and sees climate change as the most important issue facing the world, but it

has always regarded opposition to nuclear power as an article of faith. last

night the leaders of both greenpeace and friends of the earth rejected his

call.

professor lovelock, who achieved international fame as the author of the

gaia hypothesis, the theory that the earth keeps itself fit for life by the

actions of living things themselves, was among the first researchers to

sound the alarm about the threat from the greenhouse effect.

he was in a select group of scientists who gave an initial briefing on

climate change to margaret thatcher's conservative cabinet at 10 downing

street in april 1989.

he now believes recent climatic events have shown the warming of the

atmosphere is proceeding even more rapidly than the scientists of the un's

intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) thought it would, in their

last report in 2001.

on that basis, he says, there is simply not enough time for renewable

energy, such as wind, wave and solar power - the favoured solution of the

green movement - to take the place of the coal, gas and oil-fired power

stations whose waste gas, carbon dioxide (co2), is causing the atmosphere to

warm.

he believes only a massive expansion of nuclear power, which produces almost

no co2, can now check a runaway warming which would raise sea levels

disastrously around the world, cause climatic turbulence and make

agriculture unviable over large areas. he says fears about the safety of

nuclear energy are irrational and exaggerated, and urges the green movement

to drop its opposition.

in today's independent, professor lovelock says he is concerned by two

climatic events in particular: the melting of the greenland ice sheet, which

will raise global sea levels significantly, and the episode of extreme heat

in western central europe last august, accepted by many scientists as

unprecedented and a direct result of global warming.

these are ominous warning signs, he says, that climate change is speeding,

but many people are still in ignorance of this. important among the reasons

is "the denial of climate change in the us, where governments have failed to

give their climate scientists the support they needed".

he compares the situation to that in europe in 1938, with the second world

war looming, and nobody knowing what to do. the attachment of the greens to

renewables is "well-intentioned but misguided", he says, like the left's

1938 attachment to disarmament when he too was a left-winger.

he writes today: "i am a green, and i entreat my friends in the movement to

drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy."

his appeal, which in effect is asking the greens to make a bargain with the

devil, is likely to fall on deaf ears, at least at present.

"lovelock is right to demand a drastic response to climate change," stephen

tindale, executive director of greenpeace uk, said last night. "he's right

to question previous assumptions.

"but he's wrong to think nuclear power is any part of the answer. nuclear

creates enormous problems, waste we don't know what to do with; radioactive

emissions; unavoidable risk of accident and terrorist attack."

tony juniper, director of friends of the earth, said: "climate change and

radioactive waste both pose deadly long-term threats, and we have a moral

duty to minimise the effects of both, not to choose between them."

 1) his dod biography:

you can see here, he was sworn 5-4-2001 

when things started to 'steam-up' towards 911.

he was also the ceo of system planning corp.

 international=israel (excuse my language) which is an obvious 

conflict of interests (who cares, anyway?!).

 plus, find many other 'interesting' details/connections, etc.

 2) he is a neocon member of the project for the new america century.

 they got it 9-11-01!

 spc didn't 'protect' then what they didn't want to be protected, that is, 

the innocent people, the working class, the honest, the single mother

 feeding her family, children...poor children!


 page 90: last in the list. his pnac membership, and signer of this document.

 3) system planning corporation: a powerful dod contractor. zakheim was 

its ceo - international - and also 'local officer'. the website is big and you

 can find that spc (mentioned in his dod biography) is one of the most 

important "national security providers".

 many details therein, including references to remotely controlled

 mister presidents
you can't escape history forever

german minister's interview
rips 911 case open

von buelow: i can state: the planning of the attacks was technically and organizationally a master
achievement. to hijack four huge airplanes within a few minutes and within one hour, to drive them
into their targets, with complicated flight maneuvers! this is unthinkable, without years-long support
from secret apparatuses of the state and industry.

q: you are a conspiracy theorist!

von buelow: yeah, yeah. that's the ridicule heaped [on those raising these questions] by those who
would prefer to follow the official, politically correct line. even investigative journalists are fed
propaganda and disinformation. 
andreas von buelow is a former german minister of technology and state secretary in the defense ministry; 
he served for 25 years on a parliamentary commission overseeing all three branches of german intelligence. his
book, in the name of the state details the criminal activities of secret services, including the cia.
(draft) [source: tagesspiegel, jan. 13] partial translation

the following interview with von buelow appeared in the german daily 'tagesspiegel,' on jan. 13.

q: you seem so angry, really upset.

von buelow: i can explain what's bothering me: i see that after the horrifying attacks of sept. 11, all political
public opinion is being forced into a direction that i consider wrong.

q: what do you mean by that?

von buelow: i wonder why many questions are not asked. normally, with such a terrible thing, various leads and
tracks appear that are then commented on, by the investigators, the media, the government: is there something
here or not? are the explanations plausible? this time, this is not the case at all. it already began just hours after
the attacks in new york and washington and--

q: in those hours, there was horror, and grief.

von buelow: right, but actually it was astounding: there are 26 intelligence services in the u.s.a. with a budget
of (over) $30 billion--

q: more than the german defense budget.

von buelow: --which were not able to prevent the attacks. in fact, they didn't even have an inkling they would
happen. for 60 decisive minutes, the military and intelligence agencies let the fighter planes stay on the ground,
48 hours later, however, the fbi presented a list of suicide attackers. within ten days, it emerged that seven of
them were still alive.

q: what, please?

von buelow: yes, yes. and why did the fbi chief take no position regarding contradictions? where the list came
from, why it was false? if i were the chief investigator (state attorney) in such a case, i would regularly go to the
public, and give information on which leads are valid and which not.

q: the u.s. government talked about an emergency situation after the attacks: they said they were in a war. is it
not understandable that one does not tell the enemy everything one knows about him?

von buelow: naturally. but a government which goes to war, must first establish who the attacker, the enemy, is.
it has a duty to provide evidence. according to its own admission, it has not been able to present any evidence
that would hold up in court.

q: some information on the perpetrators has been proven with documents. the suspected leader, mohammad
atta, left portland for boston on the morning of sept. 11, in order to board the plane that later hit the world trade
center

von buelow: if this atta was the decisive man in the operation, it's really strange that he took such a risk of
taking a plane that would reach boston such a short time before the connecting flight. had his flight been a few
minutes late, he would not have been in the plane that was hijacked. why should a sophisticated terrorist do this?
one can, by the way, read on cnn (internet) that none of these names were on the official passenger lists. none
of them had gone through the check-in procedures. and why did none of the threatened pilots give the
agreed-upon code 7700 over the [steuerknueppel: steering nob?] to the ground station? in addition: the
german minister's interview rips 911 case open
black boxes which are fire and shock proof, as well as the voice recordings, contain no valuable data--

q: that sounds like--

von buelow: --like assailants who, in their preparations, leave tracks behind them like a herd of stampeding
elephants? they made payments with credit cards with their own names; they reported to their flight instructors
with their own names. they left behind rented cars with flight manuals in arabic for jumbo jets. they took with
them, on their suicide trip, wills and farewell letters, which fall into the hands of the fbi, because they were
stored in the wrong place and wrongly addressed. clues were left like behind like in a child's game of
hide-and-seek, which were to be followed!

there is also the theory of one british flight engineer:

according to this, the steering of the planes was perhaps taken out of the pilots' hands, from outside.

the americans had developed a method in the 1970s, whereby they could rescue hijacked planes by intervening
into the computer piloting [automatic pilot system]. this theory says, this technique was abused in this case.
that's a theory....

q: which sounds really adventurous, and was never considered.

von buelow: you see! i do not accept this theory, but i find it worth considering. and what about the obscure
stock transactions? in the week prior to the attacks, the amount of transactions in stocks in american airlines,
united airlines, and insurance companies, increased 1,200%. it was for a value of $15 billion. some people must
have known something. who?

q: why don't you speculate on who it might have been.

von buelow: with the help of the horrifying attacks, the western mass democracies were subjected to
brainwashing. the enemy image of anti-communism doesn't work any more; it is to be replaced by peoples of
islamic belief. they are accused of having given birth to suicidal terrorism.

q: brainwashing? that's a tough term.

von buelow: yes? but the idea of the enemy image doesn't come from me. it comes from zbigniew brzezinski
and samuel huntington, two policy-makers of american intelligence and foreign policy. already in the middle of
german minister's interview rips 911 case open
he 1990s, huntingon believed, people in europe and the u.s. needed someone they could hate-- this would
strengthen their identification with their own society. and brzezinski, the mad dog, as adviser to president jimmy
carter, campaigned for the exclusive right of the u.s. to seize all the raw materials of the world, especially oil and
gas.

q: you mean, the events of sept. 11--

von buelow: --fit perfectly in the concept of the armaments industry, the intelligence agencies, the whole
military-industrial-academic complex. this is in fact conspicuous. the huge raw materials reserves of the former
soviet union are now at their disposal, also the pipeline routes and--

q: erich follach described that at length in {spiegel}: ``it's a matter of military bases, drugs, oil and gas
reserves.''

von buelow: i can state: the planning of the attacks was technically and organizationally a master achievement.
to hijack four huge airplanes within a few minutes and within one hour, to drive them into their targets, with
complicated flight maneuvers! this is unthinkable, without years-long support from secretapparatuses of the state
and industry.

q: you are a conspiracy theorist!

von buelow: yeah, yeah. that's the ridicule heaped [on those raising these questions] by those who would prefer
to follow the official, politically correct line. even investigative journalists are fed propaganda and
disinformation. anyone who doubts that, doesn't have all his marbles! that is your accusation.

q: your career actually speaks against the idea that you are not in your right mind. you were already in the 1970s,
state secretary in the defense ministry; in 1993 you were the spd [social democratic party] speaker in the
schalk-golodkowski investigation committee--

von buelow: and it all began there! until that time, i did not have any great knowledge of the work of
intelligence agencies. and now we had to take note of a great discrepancy: we shed light on the dealings of the
stasi and other east bloc intelligence agencies in the field of economic criminality, but as soon as we wanted to
know something about the activities of the bnd [german intelligence] or the cia, it was mercilessly blocked. no
information, no cooperation, nothing! that's when i was first taken aback.

q: schalck-golodkowski mediated, among other things, various business deals abroad. when you looked at his
german minister's interview rips 911 case open
.case more closely--

von buelow: we found, for example, a clue in rostock, where schalck organized his weapons depot. well, then
we happened upon an affiliation of schalck in panama, and then we happened upon manuel noriega, who was for
many years president, drug dealer, and money launderer, all in one, right? and this noriega was also on the
payroll of the cia, for $200,000 a year. these were things that really made me curious.

q: you wrote a book on the dealings of the cia and co. in the meantime, you have become an expert regarding
the strange things related to intelligence services' work.

von buelow: ``strange things'' is the wrong term. what has gone on, and goes on, in the name of intelligence
services, are true crimes.

q: what would you say determines the work of intelligence services?

von buelow: so that we don't have any misunderstandings: i find that it makes sense to have intelligence
services....

q: you don't think much of the earlier proposals by the greens, who wanted to dismantle these agencies?

von buelow: no. it is right to take a look behind the scenes. getting intelligence about the intentions of an
enemy, makes sense. it is important when one tries to put oneself into the mind of the enemy. whoever wants to
understand the cia's methods, has to deal with its main tasks, {covert operations}: below the level of war, and
outside international law, foreign states are to be influenced, by organizing insurrections, terrorist attacks, usually
combined with drugs and weapons trade, and money laundering. this is essentially very simple: one arms violent
people with weapons. since, however, it must not under any circumstances come out, that there is an intelligence
agency behind it, all traces are erased, with tremendous deployment of resources.

i have the impression that this kind of intelligence agency spends 90% of its time this way: creating false leads. so
that, if anyone suspects the collaboration of the agencies, he is accused of the sickness of conspiracy madness.
the truth often comes out only years later. cia chief allen dulles once said: in case of doubt, i would even lie to
the congress!

q: the american journalist seymour m. hersh, wrote in the {new yorker,} that even some people in the cia
and government assumed, that certain leads had been laid in order to confuse the investigators. who, herr von
buelow, would have done this?

german minister's interview rips 911 case open
von buelow: i don't know that either. how should i? i simply use my common sense, and-- see: the terrorists
behaved in such a way to attract attention. and as practicing muslims, they were in a strip-tease bar, and,
drunken, stuck dollar bills into the panty of the dancer.

q: things like that also happen.

von buelow: it may be. as a lone fighter, i cannot prove anything, that's beyond my capabilities.
 i have real difficulties, however, to imagine that all this all sprung out of the mind of an evil man
 in his cave.

q: mr. von buelow, you yourself say that you are alone in your criticism. formerly, you were part of the political
establishment, now you are an outsider.


von buelow: that is a problem sometimes, but one gets used to it. by the way, i know a lot of people, including
very influential ones, who agree with me, but only in whispers, never publicly.

q: do you still have contact with old spd companions, such as egon bahr and former chancellor helmut
schmidt?

von buelow: there are no close contacts any more. i wantedto go to the last spd party congress, but i was sick.

q: can it be, mr. von buelow, that you are a mouthpiece for typical anti-americanism?

von buelow: nonsense, this has absolutely nothing to do with anti-americanism. i am a great admirer of this
great, open, free society, and always have been. i studied in the u.s.

q: how did you get the idea that there could be a link between the attacks and the american intelligence
agencies?

von buelow: do you remember the first attack on the worldtrade center in 1993?

q: six people were killed and over a thousand wounded, by a bomb explosion.
german minister's interview rips 911 case open

von buelow: in the middle was the bombmaker, a former egyptian officer. he had pulled together some muslims
for the attack. they were snuck into the country by the cia, despite a state department ban on their entry. at the
same time, the leader of the band was an fbi informant.

and he made a deal with the authorities: at the last minute, the dangerous explosive material would be replaced
by a harmless powder.

the fbi did not stick to the deal. the bomb exploded, so to speak, with the knowledge of the fbi. the official
story of the crime was quickly found: the criminals were evil muslims.

q: at the time soviet soldiers marched into afghanistan, you were in the cabinet of helmut schmidt. what was it
like?

von buelow: the americans pushed for trade sanctions, they demanded the boycott of the olympic games in
moscow....

q.... which the german government followed...

von buelow: and today we know: it was the strategy of the american security adviser, zbigniew brzezinski, to
destabilize the soviet union from neighboring muslim countries they lured the russians into afghanistan, and
then prepared for them a hell on earth, their vietnam. with decisive support of the u.s. intelligence agencies, at
least 30,000 muslim fighters were trained in afghanistan and pakistan, a bunch of good-for-nothings and fanatics
who were, and still are today, ready for anything.

and one of them is osama bin laden. i wrote years ago: ` `it was out of this brood, that the taliban grew up in
afghanistan, who had been brought up in the koran schools financed by american and saudi funds, the taliban
who are now terrorizing the country and destroying it

q: even though you say, for the u.s. it was a matter of raw materials in the region, the starting point for the u.s.
aggression, was the terrorist attack which cost thousands of human lives.

von buelow: completely true. one must always keep this gruesome act in mind. nonetheless, in the analysis of
political processes, i am allowed to look and see who has advantages and disadvantages, and what is coincidental.
when in doubt, it is always worthwhile to take a look at a map, where are raw materials resources, and the routes
to them? then lay a map of civil wars and conflicts on top of that --they coincide. the same is the case with the
third map: nodal points of the drug trade.

german minister's interview rips 911 case open
where this all comes together, the american intelligence services are not far away. by the way, the bush family
 is linked to oil, gas, and weapons trade, through the bin laden family.

q: what do you think of the bin laden films?

von buelow: when one is dealing with intelligence services, one can imagine manipulations of the highest
quality. hollywood could provide these techniques. i consider the videos inappropriate as evidence.

q: you believe the cia is capable of anything, [wouldn't stop at anything].

von buelow: the cia, in the state interests of the u.s., does not have to abide by any law in interventions
abroad, is not bound by international law; only the president gives orders.

and when funds are cut, peace is on the horizon, then a bomb explodes somewhere. thus it is proven, that you
can't do without the intelligence services; and that the critics are {nuts,} as father bush called them, bush who
was once cia head and president.

you have to see that the u.s. spends $30 billion on intelligence services, and $13 billion on anti-drug work. and
what comes out of it?

the chief of a special unit of the strategic anti-drug work [michael levin] declared, in despair, after 30 years of
service, that in every big, important drug case, the cia came in and took it out of my hands. 

q: do you criticize the german government for its reaction after sept. 11?

von buelow: no. to assume that the government were independent in these questions, would be naive.

q: herr von buelow, what will you do now?

von buelow: nothing. my task is concluded by saying, it could not have been that way [according to 
the official story] search for the truth!
