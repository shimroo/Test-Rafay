iia emergency fundeven with the current suspension on refugee resettlement, many of our clients still face urgent needs. families and individuals who have already arrived continue to rely on essential support for basic necessities such as clothing, hygiene products, and household items. our emergency fund ensures that iia and our clients do not go without critical resources during this challenging time. your donation provides relief to vulnerable community members, offering stability and dignity as they navigate an uncertain future. every contribution helps fill the gap—because the need doesn’t stop, and neither do we.
