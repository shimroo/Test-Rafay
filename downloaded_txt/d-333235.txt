welcome to the "good life" 

                            lake wildwood association is a private, gated recreational community that is centrally located between chicago and peoria, just north of varna, illinois. the association boasts two lakes - the largest, lake wildwood, is 220 acres and offers boating, fishing and swimming. lake tanglewood is 18 acres and is strictly a fishing lake located near our private campground.
                            
                            
                            lake wildwood is governed by restrictive covenants, by-laws, and rules and regulations. members of the association pay annual dues which entitles them to use of all amenities.
