        bureaucracy? read lew's call to arms: why

the launch of  philadelphia distilling's bluecoat
        gin.
        read all
        about it.



        articles that i've sold that are up on the web.

epinions: epinions is a product review
        website. i don't write there any more, but i did about 80 beer and
        whiskey tasting notes there in an effort to regain my writing style. i
        was pleased with the result, and moved on, but the tasting notes are
        still pretty good. well, some of them are.


okay, the  twelve days of christmas  are over.   
        i'm going to put the twelve
        spirited days of christmas  down here. think of it as  12 really
        brief tasting notes  on spirits.

lew loves pears    

o canada! we love
        traveling in canada, and here are some great canadian (okay, ontarian
        and quebeçois) travel and beer links.




canadian whisky page 
        get hold
        of the best of canadian whisky.


drinks links -- my favorite links. mostly
        booze-related, but not all. i don't link to just anyone, or link to
        breweries or distilleries just because i know what the link is. these
        are good stuff.




if
        any brewery or brewpub or bar is interested in a signing, tasting, or
        beer or whiskey dinner, drop
        me a line and we'll schedule something.
i do private tastings
        and events as well, in your home, at your business, or for your
        fund-raiser. references available, reasonable rates; contact
        me.
 


7/6/08: changes coming...
 
the 21 legal drinking age is
        still a mistake. here's
        why. new stuff!     9/6: all that talk about new
        zealand raising their lda? sound and fury, signifying nothing.
  
  
farewell
        to barley: i've lost my dog, after 14 years. it's a rough
        transition. 
        update: we got a puppy. not to replace barley -- never --
        but to fill the dog-sized hole in our family. he's a sweetie. see penderyn's
        picture here. 
guest
        buzz: ignorance... my daughter writes on
        teaching kids about drinking. hey, nora got re-printed on stephen
        beaumont's site! way to go, babe!
the czech republic trip (updated
        1/10) -- part iv of the czech republic trip: recent czech
        history, a little semtex in the night, and an explosive finish to the
        night. plus more pictures. take a look.  
radio lew,
        part ii:
        during my last book tour in western pa, i dropped in at the studios of
        craft beer radio and did an interview with co-host jeff bearer. take
        a listen.
more vintage stuff, (7/8
        update) another old trip report, my first
        kentucky bourbon festival, back in 1998. all the bourbon you can
        drink, steamy tents, battery-operated whiskey toys, and a zipper that
        wouldn't close.
go pro: i got a
        breathalyzer, and for $75, you can too. the ca2000 is fda-certified, and
        shirt-pocket small.
if you've never heard of me, here's a quick  résumé.
drinks writing doesn't pay well, involves lousy hours and lots of
        dull travel, and doesn't get much respect. here's why
        i do it.
brewers and distillers: if you'd like to send me samples, please check out this
advice.







 
if you find any problems with this website,
please let me know. i've tried to make
it a fairly quick load for dial-up, with a minimum of graphics, easy to read,
and no animation or flash. that's what i like in a website.
www.lewbryson.com
is hosted by lucky cat systems, which is
mike "scoats" scotese, the owner of the bar where i hang out the most,
the grey lodge pub in northeast philly. i
figured i'd support a local businessman and good beer at the same time, and it's
worked out well. if you need web hosting in this area, or a simple, inexpensive
website designed, scoats will do you right. drop
him a line.
