may update





it has been awhile, so i thought i would update a bit. here is a picture of emily. she is doing well. she has some allergies right now, but i think she will be okay. she is a tough cookie. she has significantly improved at least behavoir wise since we moved here, which is pretty great. here is ender with his bone. this picture was taken awhile ago though, because his tummy has been so obnoxious, that he is not allowed anything other than his dog food. in fact, i am considering putting him on this anti allergin diet for 6 weeks that could maybe help with his allergies. not sure if it really will though. have any of you had experience with dogs with lots of allergies? how about dogs who have allergies and had parvo? in other dog news, my apartment complex actually built a dog park in our complex! it is an enclosed area, with nothing but trees, and fun things to smell. soon they will be adding things like bags for dog waste, etc. i am really excited about it though, because i know my pups will love it. here is a picture of mike and i together for his birthday on cinco de mike-o (mayo). we went to this place nearby called texican. we are not celebrating his birthday for real until saturday though, when he is completely done with finals. i had the wait staff sing happy birthday to mike, to embarass him. by the looks of the picture it looks like it worked. note: he had no idea the waitress put the crown on him until about 20 minutes later. it was fantastic.how are you all doing??

zaidie - adorable wesite pup





this adorable little westie is named zaidie, a picture recieved by one of my readers, wendy. zaidie is "the other love" of her life .  one of the photos is obviously one of the cutest christmas photos of all time, and the other is typical westie amazingness. wendy says he is one year old in the christmas photo but in the first one he is only 4 months old. she also claims he is 100% clown and that she adores him. who wouldn't?? zaidie reminds me a lot of ender for obvious reasons. now i need to go spend time with my westie pups and give them kisses.

natalie pocta beltie





natalie wrote in about her beltie, or what she thinks is a beltie. she adopted her about 6 months ago and thought at first she might be a corgi sheltie mix, but when she saw some of the beltie pictures on my blog, she thought maybe that is what her dog was too. she says her dog is very calm and reserved, as well as playful. what do you think? do you think she could pass for a beltie?

erik sent in a cute picture of his beltie (beagle sheltie mix). i have been getting a lot of e-mails in the last week or so about the belties for some reason. so i am going to have a series of posts. if i get anything wrong i apologize, but i did work over 14 hours today. haha.is there any breed you randomly found out about recently? do you have a mixed breed pup? if so, what do you think it's mixes are?

all the puppies love dean!





i know, i know, i have not updated in a really long time. i am sorry.things have been great though. mike and i are really enjoying austin and everything it has to offer. emily and ender do as well.mike is hard at work in his graduate studies in film at ut austin. i continue to work in search engine marketing and am making a lot of friends at work. i really love my job, even though it can be stressful at times.let me do an update by month.december 2008: mike and i celebrated the holidays with his family. they stayed at our place for about 2 weeks. we had a fabulous time. ender and emily got to play with their "cousin" hunter (mike's brother's dog) and chloe (mike's parents dog). i did not give any one food poisoning with my first christmas dinner either. although several of us did get the flu.january 2009: mike and i celebrated our 5th anniversary. we made home made pizza together, went to a great brunch, strolled the ut campus and fed squirrels and went to a golf driving range.february 2009: so far this month we have gotten sick again, and worked hard (me in work, him in school). we are celebrating valentine's day this coming saturday because we did not feel well enough to do it on the 14th.let me update you with some more photos:mike and stephen at the rockets game. we got to see them go into double overtime and win!there was actually snow in austin for one night! woo hoo!also the puppies dressed up as presents on christmas!i will try to get more pictures up later. i hope you enjoy this!
