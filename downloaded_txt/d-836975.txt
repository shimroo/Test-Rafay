superdetailing the tamiya honda nsr500 1984  1/12 scale 
	this article is about the assembly and detailing of the tamiya honda nsr500 from 1984, using the awesome hobby design detail set and other aftermarket stuff, such as rivets, bolts heads and so on. the model is a recent release from tamiya, and the detail of the kit is astonishing. given the very peculiar characteristic of this motorcycle, as the fuel tank placed below the engine, and the exhausts infront of the driver’s chest, i decided to show the cowling not placed on the chassis.

building the vw 1300 beetle 1963 - herbie - tamiya 1/24 scale 
	the volkswagen beetle is undoubtedly one of the most popular cars in all the history. the attractive and singular body’s shape has turned it into an icon in our recent history. at the end of the 60s, disney studios decide to immortalize the small car taking it to the cinema screen in herbie, a movie in which this beetle played a central role and five sequences came later. the first movie the love bug which was known in spain as ahí va ese bólido, was premiered in 1969.

building the porsche turbo rsr 934 jagermeister  tamiya #24328 1/24 scale 
	it was in 1978 when i saw for the first time, the tamiya porsche 934 at a hobby shop. though, the 1/12 model was built straight from the box and without paint, the details seemed to be surrealist and impossible to imagine up to that moment. it was my first approach to that tamiya kit in 1/12 scale. perhaps, with the aim of re releasing that success, several years ago tamiya manufactured the same car, winner of so many championships, but in 1/24 (the most popular scale) which is the subject of this article that aims at helping the less experienced modeler to build the new tamiya porsche.

	in this article i describe the work to superdetail the tamiya ferrari f1-2000, the car that brought back the driver championship in maranello with michael schumacher, after 21 years from the last championship. the tamiya kit is good, but the aim is to add as much details as possible, by using the top studio; super detail set, and antenna set, and other aftermarket details (photo-etched bolts, rivets and so on).

ultimate guide for the ixocollections / eaglemoss mercedes 300 sl "gullwing" (w198 i) 1/8 scale


by lars wahlström 

              
	over the years, a number of model kits have been made of the 300 sl in various scales. pocher announced in 2016 that they would release a die-cast kit of the 1:8 scale gullwing model, but the project was cancelled due to a financial crisis within pocher. i suspected it was pct who made it, because a couple of years later they released a 1:8 scale coupe model kit that was sold as subscription kits through eaglemoss. i wanted to build the model as soon as i heard about it, but it was hard to come by and i wasn't interested in a long term subscription. eaglemoss went bankrupt in 2022, but pct owned the tools and decided to rerelease the kit in 2023, but this time as a "full kit" through its sister company ixo, so i ordered. i had seen on various forums and model sites that the kit was not completely accurate in every detail, but that's part of the fun of improving, detailing and making your own model unique.

by felice ferriello 

              
	tamiya offer an excellent model for ferrari lovers, that can’t be missing in a collection. in my opinion, it’s a very complex kit so not recommended for novices or those who want to spend some time distracted and relaxed with a simple model. its complexity obliges you to study very carefully the instructions preparing a building plan, altering the instruction steps to get a good result.
	this article aims at sharing with the reader the work achieved during several months to superdetail this beautiful model, providing lots of images.

by mark laird 

              
	i have seen many people building the 1/12 scale meng mp4/4. since this car held the record for the most wins in f1 until the end of the 2023 season, when the red bull rb19 claimed that title, it's a car i've always been interested in building. after admiring the work of others on their models, i decided to take the plunge and purchase one myself. with over 50 years of experience building models, i couldn’t resist the urge to customize it rather than assembling it straight out of the box.

building the idf m1 super sherman from the tamiya kit #35322 1/35 scale


by allon kira 

              
	the kit released on 2011, as expected from a tamiya's, has a very good parts fit and is easy to build, very accurate and requires almost no putty. some aftermarket details slightly upgrade the overall look, but are not really necessary. it can certainly be built directly out of the box at the highest level. the only thing that seemed problematic to me were the vinyl tracks. i considered replacing them with metal ones, but after painting i decided that their level of detail was enough.

improving the fokker dr.1 - roden 1/32 scale


by claudio kalicinski 

              
	the kit was manufactured by the ukrainian company, roden and without doubt is the best fokker dr.1 kit in 1/32. regrettably, it perpetuates some mistakes common to previous models of the fokker dr.1 because all of them have been based on ian stair's scale drawings published in the fokker dr.1 special by albatros publications. these scale drawings, although are correct in dimensions, have some mistakes like the absence of the opening for the oil filling on the starboard side of the front decking and the lower panel where is located an access hatch to the engine and the incorporation of a detachable axle wing, correct for some versions of the fokker d.vii, but not for the dr.1 which its axle wing was fixed.....

building and improving the italeri / protar alfa romeo 179 1980 1/12 scale


by mario covalski 

              
	in may 2001 i wrote a brief preview on the protar's 1/12 alfa romeo 179. this wonderful formula one was one of the few cars in modern f1 history which chassis and engine were the same brand. is this model really difficult? this is the key question for this model, and the answer is no. if it were a tamiya model, that is to say the same matrix but injected with tamiya plastic and having the quality control of this huge japanese company, i would say that this is one of the most delicious models i have ever built. unfortunately, it has some flaws, mainly due to its poor quality than to the work of the protar craftsmen.

ultimate guide for the revell / monogram 65 chevrolet corvette sting ray 1/8 scale


by lars wahlström 

              
	in 1977, as a christmas gift from my brother, i got a model kit of a 1965 chevrolet corvette sting ray in 1/8 scale. the kit was made by monogram, but the same kit was later also released by revell. there were editions with the body in both red and blue plastic. i noticed quite immediately that the detail level was low, lower than many models in 1/25 scale. not even the doors were operable and the chrome-plating quality was really poor. comparing with the french heller's super detailed 1/8 model kit of the citroen b15, which i built earlier, the corvette was toyish and a real disappointment for an experienced modeller. but i decided to take it on anyway.

	the alfa romeo 155 v6 ti from the dtm series is one of my favorite model cars, so i couldn't resist and, just a few days after receiving it, i immediately placed it on my workbench. actually, i was looking for a way to relieve the pressure from various events in my daily life. the kit seems more refined and of better quality compared to the mclaren f1 gtr kit, for example, which i had built some time earlier. a clear indication of this is that i have seen several completed by modelers, while the mclaren remains a 'rara avis.' apart from the version i built myself, there may be others, but to date, i haven’t seen them.

	when i face this type of project and there’s no commercial kit available, i try to gather as much information as possible, written information and references pictures with the purpose of giving myself the idea of the different parts i’ll need to build the puzzle. later, i start looking for the kits from which i can take parts from. in this case, i took as base some parts from the tamiya ford quad (ref.#35045). besides, i noticed that a feature of this ford f30 is that it has chevrolet axles, this was why i had to go to the italeeri chevrolet kit. (ref.#6233)

	the aim of this tutorial is to share with the reader the modifications made on the 1/16 t-55 from the firm hooben, to convert it into a tiran 5 of the idf (israeli defence forces), a small modelling project that i wanted to do since several years ago. besides to help the reader, especially to those who has never built a hooben t55, to solve the problems i had to deal with, alert them to several problems that appears after some use, like it happened to me with the one built in 2011 (the old kit version). as i said before, i built a regular t-55 of the russian army and the idf tiran 5, but in the basic assembly steps, i’ll concentrate in the general points. so here you will see pictures of different models, about the same topic.

superdetailing the hasegawa lancia 037 1/24 scale


by antonio busciglio 

              
	the model i wanted to build was the version that ran on the tour de corse in 1984 season, driven by attilio bettega (who lost its life in the same car during the 1985 season) with cresto as a co driver. the martini livery makes this car absolutely stunning, but also quite demanding for the modeler. moreover, the only plastic kit available on the market is the not so recent hasegawa kit. in my opinion it’s quite well designed, easy to assemble parts, good general fitting, good materials quality. however...

by geo tziafas 

              
	starting a hiro kit build is essentially starting a game of chess. each move affects the next and the slightest mistake may cost in fitting or detailing issues. in addition, as in the famous board game, the more moves (test fits) you are ahead the better you can predict the way they will interact with each other and the less likely it is to be checkmated during the final assembly.

superdetailing the tamiya honda ra272 1/20 scale


by antonio busciglio 

              
	the model nicely reproduces the shape of the car, but most of the details are missing, or oversimplified due to production and technology issues. on this basis, i decided to build this model adding as much detail as possible for my skills. as an additional difficulty, there are nearly no detail sets for this kit, so it would be necessary to add them from scratch. in particular, i used a large number of resin rivets and bolts, some turned bolts, leftover photoetched from my spare box and a lot of scratch-building. in this tutorial i’ll describe all the building process in detail. i hope you’ll enjoy building this model as i did.

	when i was asked to build the italeri mirage, i was really excited. i had dreamed since long ago with building and representing the weathering using new technologies on an aircraft. as some friends know, i’m colorblind and never could realize about the colors of an aircraft weathering. i used to build a lot of 1/72 matchbox kits (some military vehicles) as a child , sometimes painting them. anyway, nothing to do with the new techniques and besides, since the age of twelve, i’ve not touched a military kit.

	the ducatti panigale is to my liking one of the most spectacular motorcycles of the past decade. thanks to tamiya we can have a model of it, both were the reasons why i decided to build it trying to get the most detailed model i could , taking advantage of the fact that as it was a mass production model, it would be possible for me to get a lot of references. not only i built and superdetailed the model, but also made a slightly and own customized version, a real panigale, as i would like to have. the aim of this article, is to show with pictures and their comments the work accomplished as a guide and to give ideas of the details that can be added or showing in some cases how to do the different tasks.

	tamiya offer an excellent model for ferrari lovers, that can’t be missing in a collection. in my opinion, it’s a very complex kit so not recommended for novices or those who want to spend some time distracted and relaxed with a simple model. its complexity obliges you to study very carefully the instructions preparing a building plan, altering the instruction steps to get a good result.
	this article aims at sharing with the reader the work achieved during several months to superdetail this beautiful model, providing lots of images.

building the chevy 1969 camaro revell-monogram 1/12 scale


by edwing e. merlo paredes 

              
	nowadays, there are not a great many 1/12 car model kits available. perhaps, you may find some, from doyusha, fujimi, tamiya, monogram, revell, around the internet. from my point of view, the 1/12 scale has some disadvantages with respect to the 1/24 scale, these models size and the apace they take at the time of being displayed either in your house or at exhibitions; besides one must be extremely careful with the details, since they will be more visible.

	i intended to build this ducati almost “out of box”, meaning that i won't execute any sophisticated conversions or intensive super detailing. first of all this kit is already pretty good detailed, in spite of its age, and furthermore it's not a racebike, but a classic streetbike from the ‘80s that has never heard of carbon fiber or electronic devices. the only exceptions i will allow myself are the wiring which i will replace by thinner wires to add some realism, and the joint screws at the cowling exterior...
