testimonials 



    my wife and i are from the united states.  we recently spent a month in greece, and everything was arranged for us by electra, including our rental cars, ferries and hotels.  we had a great time, and everything went very smoothly.  she kept in touch with us regularly during the trip.  we will definitely have her plan our trip again if we return to greece, and recommend her without hesitation. 
          jeff and diane




 we recommend joss travel for their excellent knowledge of greece and the tourist industry, and especially for their dedicated passion to making sure their clients have the best possible experience of greece.
