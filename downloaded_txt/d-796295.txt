testimonialswe had a vip pony party for my 7-y.o. that had her birthday party cancelled last years as the covid lockdown started. it was a splurge but the kids all loved it and the parents too. my daughter is still talking about putting the bows on the pigs, feeding the various animals, holding the bunnies, and petting the wallaby. she’s also declared that she wants her birthday party there next year already.

testimonialsi absolutely love it here! the staff are so nice and i love that they offer multiple programs. their summer and day camp is such a great experience and they treat all their animals so well. i also like that they have programs for more experienced and older people, like the working students. i come here for riding lessons once a week, and soon i’ll be going two days a week. i’ve progressed so much since i started riding here and it’s been so awesome!

testimonialsour rabbits love their timothy hay and pellets. worth the drive to check out what they have to offer.

testimonialsi needed straw for a cat house i built for 4 friendly feral cats.all of the straw sold in nj had tackifier, which is basically adhesive which kept the straw from blowing away when used as cover for grass seed. this is not good for animal bedding.i spoke to al at sweet meadow farm and he was very helpful. they had exactly what i needed. i ordered it and it arrived the next day. steve m
