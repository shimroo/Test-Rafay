welcome to foreven.com!


a resource of the imperial farspace service


use of information: color coding

these pages represent the home of the imperial farspace service
operation
in the foreven sector.  many of these resources are also available
to imperial citizens, and to residents of foreven.  some of the
information,
however, is available only to a limited subset of travellers. 
color
coding is used as follows:

 




red
background
indicates referee only
pages.  they are not intended for player access, or for casual
browsing. 
on occasion an individual player may have been told by their referee
they
have access to specific items; that is the only exception.  links
to such pages are on a red background.




orange background
indicates limited access
pages.  they should only be accessed by players whose characters
would
have this knowledge, e.g. have purchased it in the context of the game,
or where their character has specific knowledge of the
information. 
links to such pages are on an orange background.




light blue
background indicates acess only to imperial
farspace service members.  links
to
such
pages are on a light blue background.




any other
background indicates general
availability. 
any traveller would normally have access to this information.




note that limitation of access is through self-restraint. 
there
is no protection built into this site.  please respect the intent
of these limitations.
