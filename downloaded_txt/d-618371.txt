why do i need to enter my flight details?
by providing your flight number, the car rental agent at the pick-up location will be informed about your arrival time and also about possible delays. this will help secure your reserved vehicle in case of a flight delay.
        some agents only confirm a reservation if a flight number is provided. if this applies to your rental, we will contact you separately.

once you complete your booking, we will send you a confirmation of your reservation within 48 hours via email. please check to see if the email accidentally went into your email spam folder. if you haven't received the confirmation email please contact us.

my booking status is âprovisionally confirmedâ â what does this mean?
 if you receive information that your booking has been provisionally confirmed, this means that we experienced some difficulty trying to charge the card you provided. this might be due to you providing us with incorrect card details, having insufficient funds on your card, your bank not authorising the transaction due to a limit on the card etc. if your booking status is set to provisionally confirmed, we will contact you to reprocess the transaction and confirm your booking.

        if you wish to return your car outside the normal rental desk office hours, the car rental agent may choose to charge an extra 'out-of-hours fee'. we will clearly mention any additional charges at the time of booking.
        can i get a discount for returning the car earlier?
no. as per our terms and conditions we are unable to provide a refund for the unused days should you return the hired vehicle earlier than originally arranged.

insurance

is insurance included?
on most rentals yes, but it may have an excess
how can i reduce or remove the excess from my insurance?
we recommend purchasing the excess reimbursement insurance at the time of booking. our partner allianz insurance offers a complete excess reimbursement insurance package which is up to 50% cheaper than what you would pay at the rental supplier's desk. the insurance cost and conditions will be displayed at the time of booking.
        what does the car rental insurance cover?
in most cases, the allianz excess reimbursement insurance package covers:
car hire excess
accidental damage to windows, tyres, undercarriage, and roof
rental car key cover
personal possessions
further information as well as the exact costs covered can be found in the excess reimbursement terms and conditions at the time of booking
please note that, regardless of your insurance, the car rental agent will block the excess amount on your credit card as a deposit. if you return the vehicle undamaged, the deposit will be released immediately. in the unfortunate event that the car is damaged during the rental, the agent will retain the deposit in order to cover the cost. if you have allianz insurance, you will be reimbursed for the insured amount charged by the car rental agent.
        
make sure you have sufficient funds on your credit card at the time of pick-up to cover the deposit. the excess amount can vary depending on the rental conditions but will be clearly stated in your rental voucher.
how do i make an insurance claim?

        all claims should be made directly with allianz when you arrive back home from your trip. you will receive all documents and information needed to make a claim shortly after you purchase the insurance.
fuel
how much will i need to pay for fuel?
the fuel policy is determined by the car rental agent and in most cases also dependent on the rental duration. there are different types of fuel policies and we will clearly state which one applies at the time of booking. the most common fuel policies are:
        pick up full, return empty
        â this fuel policy type is applicable to rentals of a minimum of 4 days. your vehicle will be supplied with a full tank of fuel and can be returned empty. on pick-up, the rental agent will charge you for a full tank of fuel. the price per litre charged by the rental agent may be higher than the price at the local service station. fuel charges are payable at the rental counter. there is no refund for unused fuel.
        pick up full, return full
        â this fuel policy type is applicable to rentals of 1 to 3 days. your vehicle will be supplied with a full tank of fuel. to avoid incurring fuel charges you will need to return it full. you may be required to leave a fuel deposit reserved on your credit card that will be released when you return the car full. missing fuel will be charged on your return. please note that the price per litre charged by the rental agent may be significantly higher than the price at the local service station. fuel charges are payable at the rental desk unless otherwise stated. 
we recommend checking the policy details during the booking process under rental conditions to avoid unexpected charges.
can i change the fuel policy?
unfortunately this is not possible as the car rental agents determine their fuel policy individually.

        i think i have been overcharged for fuel by the car rental agent
if you feel that you have been overcharged by the car rental agent at the rental desk or after drop-off, please contact us, so we can investigate your case.

        vehicle
will i get the exact car model displayed during the booking?
during the booking process, we will display images of similar cars in the same category. unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that the car rental agent will have the exact same model available. however, you are entitled to a vehicle in the same category, holding the same amount of passengers and with the same luggage capacity. if the car rental agent does not provide you with a car of the same category, you are entitled to a refund. for more information, please contact us.
        how do i find out about the luggage capacity of a vehicle?
the luggage capacity will be displayed at the time of booking with a symbol.
can i request an automatic car?
yes. when searching for a car, you can use our search filters on the left hand side and choose to display cars with 'automatic transmission' only. the specific transmission type will be displayed with a symbol at the time of booking. please note that outside of the us and canada, many car rental agents only have limited availability for automatic cars.
        my rental car was damaged at pick-up â what should i do?
if you notice that the reserved vehicle is damaged at pick-up, raise this issue with the car rental agent immediately and request an alternative. if the matter is not resolved, contact us so we can try and arrange a suitable substitute with the car rental agent. any damages on the car might affect your excess if not addressed before the rental.
        my rental car was in a bad condition at pick-up â what should i do?
if the reserved vehicle is in a bad condition at pick-up, raise this issue with the car rental agent immediately and request an alternative. if the matter is not resolved, contact us so we can try and arrange a suitable substitute with the car rental agent.

        when will i be charged for optional extras?
if you select optional extras at the time of booking, they will be added to the total price. however, if you choose to purchase optional extras at the rental desk, the agent will charge you at the rental desk in local currency.
        i reserved an optional extra but it was not available at pick-up â what should i do?
paperwork
which documents do i need to bring to the rental desk?
the rental voucher we will send you as part of the booking confirmation contains all documents required at the time of pick-up. in most cases, in order to release the reserved vehicle, you need to bring:
        credit card in the name of the driver. credit cards accepted for pick-up are mastercard, visa, and in most cases also american express.

do i need an international driver's licence?
if your licence is not printed in the roman alphabet (i.e. arabic, greek, russian or chinese) you will need to bring an international driving licence and your domestic licence. if you are renting abroad (outside the eu), an international drivers licence is usually required regardless of the alphabet. international driver's licences must be accompanied by the original domestic licence of the driver. uk licence holders need to present the photo card and the paper counterpart.
        is it sufficient to present a copy of my driving licence?

        no. a copy of your licence will not be accepted by the car rental agent. the original document will need to be presented at pick-up.
refunds
what is your cancellation policy?
we offer a full refund if the booking is cancelled within 24 to 48  hours of booking. if the booking is cancelled after this time but before the scheduled pick-up time, if the booking is cancelled after the scheduled pick-up time, no funds will be reimbursed.
