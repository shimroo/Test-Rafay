multiple august shows in vermont!

posted on july 22, 2018  by  webmaster 


wolfsgart 9.0 is coming up in 2 weeks, august 2nd through 5th, at the champlain valley expo in vermont!  unfortunately i’ll be in nyc that weekend and unable to cover it but i recommend everyone that can there to head that way because it’s a massive event!
next up on august 26th is the 2018 eurobuilt car show & charity auction at the vermont state fair grounds in rutland, vt.  its third year looks to be a great one with with camping, activity, and as always the big auction to benefit foundation blue.  i wasn’t able to make it in 2017 but i’ll be back this year with full photo coverage.

new content: wolfsgart 8

posted on august 10, 2017  by  webmaster 


the album from last weekend is up with nearly 350 photos. unfortunately this year life got crowded on show weekend and i wasn’t able to be as thorough as i wanted. alpha class has nearly full coverage but folks were prepping for the big cruise before i was able to hit the fields and so my opportunity to shoot outside was limited.

travel and jetta updates

posted on june 30, 2017  by  webmaster 


just a quick note – i’ve updated my travel plans page.  i’m hoping to hit 3 of the 5.  wolfsgart and eurobuilt are near certainties barring some sort of life crisis.  h2oi is a bit of a moonshot.
in other news, i’ve had to divert funds towards replacing my wife’s transportation.  that and a couple other unexpected expenses make it pretty unlikely that the jetta gets back on the road this year.  am hoping to at least get the floor patched up before the snow returns.

a first year show in central vermont.  just like the gmvwc shows of times gone by, this took place in the peak of the autumn foliage season.  the day was overcast but the rain held back. pics here!

this is not thejohnsonshow.com, no…

posted on september 13, 2016  by  webmaster 


this is just a tribute.
whoever was camping out on thejohnsonshow.com let it lapse, so i’ve snagged it and pointed it at the johnson show 2008 gallery, restoring continuity to links for anyone looking to relive that day.  i may flesh out something a bit more substantial, scraping together various forum accounts of the day and whatever the wayback machine has picked up into a coherent historical record.

floor work continues

posted on august 28, 2016  by  webmaster 


passenger rear pan looked concerning but other than a touch of surface rust it’s super clean so far.  most of the ugly appears to have been rusty water residue (due to the seat rail) that coated the surface as pooled water evaporated.  it all feels solid when probed but i’ll get all the tar off of the front and back and get a better look just in case.

 
the same can’t be said for the driver’s side.  continue reading →

damaged wheel

posted on august 28, 2016  by  webmaster 


one of the 4 kassel wheels i’m going to be rolling has a damaged flange.  before pursuing repair i figured it’d be wise to throw it on an axle and spin it while recording via stationary camera to see if it was still relatively straight.  the axle moved upwards slightly on the upswing (you can see it move) but to my eye it looks like its still true.











also the site has a youtube channel now so that’s thing i guess.
full blackbird album here.

working on blackbird

posted on august 26, 2016  by  webmaster 


it’s time to get the old girl back on the road.  i’ll be parting with the 3 spoke borbets and returning to factory p-slot (“kassel”) rims.  one of these is damaged so i need a lead on a single replacement or someone that can fix it (presuming it’s straight.)  also the rear driver’s floor pan has issues that need sorting out.


full blackbird album here.
