dry cleaner bronzy









mommy: erm... bronzy?






mommy: when i asked you to help me press my jackets, i didn't quite mean for you to do them this way.




 bronzy: but this is the best way! i'm napping and pressing all at once. it is called multi-tasking.

the easy way to confine cats






just place a small fabric on the spot you want the cats to stay on and...

tadah!









they will automatically gravitate towards it and remain rooted there.

easy-peasy!

our first week in the new house








mommy: slash, you're not doing much. why don't you help out a little with the packing?





slash: hey, looking pretty in seductive poses is a lot of work!




slash: okay, fine... i'll help out by patting on the packing tape for this torn corner.




slash: and now i have an owwie. see! my paw is sore.



slash: i need to rest so that my body can heal from the trauma.




slash: i'm passing out now. no one disturb me please. zzzz...





hi there, 5-cat style here!

sorry, i've been away for so long.

the move was beyond dramatic and exhausting,

and the kitties needed a few days to adjust to the new place.

i hadn't realised that my bedroom is right beside the train tracks and so

you can imagine just how freaked out slash and bronzy were by the loud noises.



but bronzy did quite well, i thought.

it took her about a day to adapt to all the strange noises and smells.

she was also very quick to befriend our two new housemates,

a young and newly married couple.

the wife is italian and the husband colombian.

the wife has 6 cats back in italy and misses them terribly.

and so she was very excited about having slash and bronzy in the house.



slash, on the other hand, took a much longer time to adjust to the new surroundings.

the first 2 days must have been the worst for him because he refused all food.

as it is, slash is already on the thin side.

for him not to eat at all worried me terribly and so i tried to force-feed him some kibble.

i managed to get him to swallow about 6 tiny pieces.

but from the 7th onwards, he would spit them out on to the carpet, his fur, my legs, etc.

thankfully, slash started to eat a little on the 3rd day.

by the 5th day, his appetite was back to its usual.



now that we've been here a full week, the cats are a lot more at ease.

bronzy is coping beautifully.

she acts as though she has lived here all her life.

slash, however, is comfortable only in my bedroom.

his favourite spot is under my bed.

he still isn't too friendly with the housemates, but he just needs another week or two.



i'm sorry i haven't got any photos of the new house to share yet.

firstly, i've been so busy with uni work and all the unpacking that needs to be done.

with 70 boxes of crap and junk, that is a lot of unpacking.

secondly, my 70 boxes have completely cluttered up half the house!

believe me... you don't want to see the mess.

you'd thank me for waiting until the house looks lovely again before photographing it.



so to make up for the lack of photos,

here are some from when i was packing in the old house.

happy viewing!







the great wall of boxes begin to take shape with 20 boxes.




as the 20 boxes grew to 30, slash and bronzy helped to make sure that the wall stood steady.







slash: i'll help balance out the weight in this corner.





slash: mommy, you have some missing boxes.





slash: see... box 22, box 27, box 31...





slash: where are the in-between boxes?





mommy: bronzy, what are you doing to your brother?





slash: bronzy told me that i needed to be packed away too.

*the next morning*





mommy: again? bronzy, stop putting your brother inside boxes!

getting close to moving day!






hello friends!

i'll be losing my internet connection tonight

and won't get settled into the new apartment until sunday.



this means that i won't be able to update this blog for the next few days.



meanwhile, my lovely house has become a war zone of dust and boxes.

but slash and bronzy do try to help out by lending a paw here and there.



just look at bronzy here.









while i was busy packing away all the beddings,

she busied herself with making sure that none of the plastic packs were torn or damage.






and please don't worry.

the bag wasn't sealed.







in fact, the zipper was wide open since i was about to stuff more blankets into the pack.

you can see one side of the open zipper in some of the pictures.
























alrighty, i had better get back to the packing.

i still have about another 10 or so boxes to fill up.

and as you can see, the kitties are already being very 'helpful'.

big move coming up








mommy: slashy, we're moving house soon. can you help out with some of the packing please?





slash: let me think about it.





slash: hmmm... okay, i have my answer.





slash: no!





while searching for a pet-friendly house to move into,

i got to know a lovely young lady with a dog and cat of her own.

we exchanged photos of our furry babies and ooh-ed and aah-ed over them.

with permission from her, here is a very sweet photo of her two darlings.



caesar the dog and izzy the cat



as much as i do like her and her two cuties,

i decided not to move into her place after she cautioned that

"... the dog could be a problem.

he's amazing with them when he considers them 'his' cats,

but can be a bit over the top at first and,

if the cats aren't used to dogs, it could be very stressful for them to begin with.

wouldn't be so much of an issue if he wasn't a 38kg bullmastiff x greyhound

that likes to chase unfamiliar furry things!"



i do hope that slash and bronzy will eventually learn to get along with dogs.

but it would be a good idea to take baby steps and start them off with a small pup perhaps.



meanwhile, i've found us a lovely apartment to move in to.

we'll be sharing it with a young couple who are absolutely beside themselves

at the thought of having slash and bronzy in the house.

this is a relief for me for i know that the kitties won't just be tolerated,

but that they would be genuinely welcomed in the house.

slash & bronzy's nemesis: the vacuum cleaner








slash: bronzy, are you sure that this is a good hiding place?





bronzy: trust me, it is. just lean in closer to me.


slash: but i feel rather exposed.




slash: omg. i can hear it coming closer. it's here!!!




slash & bronzy: heeeellp!!!





slash: is it gone? i don't think my heart can take this anymore.

bronzy: i think it is. but keep leaning in until i'm sure, ok?

mommy had better give us lots of treatsies after this.

being difficult is fun for us!






when mommy wants to take a silly photo of us, we may not be able to stop her.

but we can make her slog for it.

here's how we do it...





hey, guys... let's take a group photo with tiger, shall we?

are you ready? on the count of three!

one, two, thr...





 hey! stop yawning, slash.

let's try again.

one, two, thr...






hey! what's going on? is all this yawning planned?

let's try it one more time.

one, two, three!

*click*



a good shot finally.

thanks, guys!
