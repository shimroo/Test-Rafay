laser veil stealth coating
(16 viewing)

the only one of its kind, veil is an anti-laser stealth coating that can be used stand-alone or with active laser countermeasures.  it is even effective at reducing the targeting range of the latest lidar guns designed to be "unjammable" and costs a fraction of a laser jammer.
