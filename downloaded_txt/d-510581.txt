well, what's new with me...







well, i can't really think of anything major going on that requires me to update everyone.  mariana is getting bigger by the day.  she grew a quarter of an inch since july 20th!  she also has a whole new variety of words coming out of her mouth!  for instance she says, "daddy" instead of da, mommy instead of "ma ma", shoes, ball, she tries to count to three, and just a bunch of other little words.  the other day i put her baby doll on the shelf near her crib, where the baby goes when she isn't playing with it or cuddling with it at bedtime, and she pointed at it and said, "baby sleeping", sounded more like "babyy  seeping", but it was adorable!phil is going back to work, yesterday was his first day back.  i hate it already.  i mean it's good that he works, but i got very used to him being home with me.  but it's only until next vacation.  i love teacher vacations!school starts back up in a few weeks, so that's awesome!  i can't wait to get back in.  classes begin august 22nd.  caitie, laura, brittney, and i are taking an ed class together, which is really nice because it's my only non-online class and i will know people in it!well that's it for now i guess.

st. pete times article...







my mother-in-law's 50th birthday just passed....dinner and a movie were just part of a big eveninga husband puts in extra effort to make sure his wife's 50th birthday is something to treasure.by waveney ann moore, times staff writerpublished july 19, 2006st. petersburg - gotcha! that was bob johnston's triumphant exclamation when his wife walked into the surprise 50th birthday party he'd organized for her at the muvico theaters at baywalk.she had known that they were going to a movie and dinner. it was at dinner, she had suspected from recent whisperings and surreptitious phone calls, that she would get her surprise."i was wrong," loretta johnston wrote in an e-mail telling the st. petersburg times about the celebration. "it was the movie! my husband had bought out a movie theater (250 seats) for the premier weekend of pirates of the caribbean and invited our family and friends to attend a private showing of the movie with us.""i was totally surprised," she said this week. "my brother said he had never seen my face so beet red. it was such an amazing day."her husband had gotten the idea months earlier, when he noticed that muvico rented its theaters for business events. he spoke with the manager and made arrangements for the birthday celebration that coincidentally fell on the opening weekend of johnny depp's blockbuster, pirates of the caribbean: dead man's chest."it was a lot of money," bob johnston, an instructor at pinellas technical education center, said of the $2,500 expenditure. "i had to buy every seat in the theater. it was funny, because with it being that much money, we never spend that much money without talking to each other."facing the predicament of how to consult his wife about the money without giving away the secret, bob johnston said he asked her if he could spend it on something "totally ridiculous." she agreed."she just knew that i was going to surprise her, but she didn't know where or how and when," he said.his wife, who is a corporate account manager for weight watchers, had her suspicions. married for almost 28 years, with three adult children, meghan alfaro, phillip and caitlin, and one grandchild, 17-month-old mariana, she thought her husband might be organizing a cruise."i knew something was going to happen, but i didn't know where or what," she said, adding that she made sure not to eavesdrop on phone calls or ask any questions. "i didn't want to ruin my surprise."the weekend pirates opened, her husband bought a couple of tickets for the movie and told her they were going to a movie and dinner. it was three days before her july 12 birthday. guests, some of whom had traveled from out of town, had been told to gather at the theater 45 minutes early."and as we walked in, the whole theater just yells, 'surprise,' and she doesn't know what to do and she just kind of ran back and hid behind the wall," her husband recounted this week. "once she turned the corner again and realized that she knew everybody, she said, 'did you rent the theater?' it was just wonderful. we had about 45 people there."daughter meghan gave a powerpoint presentation of her mother's life.bob johnston is still grinning about the surprise he managed to get past his wife."the biggest thing for me was just the thrill of pulling it off," he said. four years ago, as his 50th birthday approached, she had done the same to him."i was determined that since she had gotten me so well, i was going to get her," he said.[last modified july 18, 2006, 20:34:29]

how much is my little girl like me?







when i look at mariana i see a lot of her father.  i see phil's ear's, his smile, and his facial expressions (most of the time).  i do see a bit of my own features staring back at me, particularly my big brown eyes.  which i must say look much cuter on her in my honest opinion.  the one thing however i might wish she would get from her father, that she inherited from me instead, is her temper and attitude.  so in light of that, here's my little anecdote.today, my little girl decided that she wanted to get into the kitchen cabinets below the sink...  this is where we keep the cleaning supplies and such.  i said "mariana, get out of there."  now, they get closed and she opens them back up.  i repeat myself.  they get closed, and she opens them back up a third time.  so, i repeat myself and add, "if you open them again you're gonna get a spanking."  and she opened them again.  so, i close the cabinets walk her away from them and tap her gently on her butt.  (i don't beat her or anything, just a light tap.)  my daughter got quite mad, went over to the refridgerator, grabbed one of her leapfrog letter magnets, and throws it across the kitchen floor.  i pick up the magnet, put it back and tell her that "we don't throw things because we're mad." so she grabs the magnet again and throws it again.  i once a gain tap her on the butt and move all of the magnets out of her reach and say, "there, now you don't get to play with them.  do you have anything else you want to throw, because i'll take that away too?"  my nearly 18 month old daughter looks me straight in the eye, nods at me, and walks over to the nearest dog toy, picks it up, and throws it!now, what am i supposed to do with that?  she deliberately said yes to me and went to find something to throw.  unfortunately, it caught me so off guard that i laughed at her.  definitely not the right response i know.  but honestly, the little brat takes right after me.  you'd think i might be annoyed after such a display of temper, but i just realized even more that i love that kid.  so, yeah, i may have wished she'd get her attitude from phil, but i wouldn't change her for all the world now.meanwhile, immediately after, she took a nap and woke up in a much better mood with brand new child proof locks on all of the cabinets.current mood:  amused

fun times







so we had friends in from out of town for a week.  it was really great because we'd never met before, just been talking online and on the phone for a year or so.  maddox, zaleigh, stacey and jenny were an absolute blast the whole week they were here.  we went to busch gardens and adventure island.  adventure island was a blast because it was mariana's first time there, and she loved it.  she'd cry whenever we lifted her out of the water.then mad and zale took phil and i to arabian nights.  it's a really nifty dinner theater in orlando.  it's a really great horse show.  they treated us and we had a blast.oh and we went to ybor.  that's the first time i've gone out dancing in years.  i mean since before i got pregnant with mariana by at least 3 months.  so it's been quite a while.  well, my parents were super sweet and kept mariana overnight, so we stayed out almost all night.  everyone actually got to meet and stuff.  meghan, alan, chris, nina, jenny, stacey, caitie, mike, phil, and i all met up in ybor.  mike, caitie, phil and i drove together and chris, nina, stacey, and jenny followed us.  we met meghan and alan at prana.  let me tell you it was so funny.  we went up to ybor and phil missed the exit, then we turned around and got a little lost for about 3 minutes.  so we get back on the interstate and make it to ybor, park in the garage, and head over to prana.  they wouldn't let mike in because he was wearing shorts so we pitched in and got him some jeans from a store on the strip.  so, we finally got into prana after about an hour of things holding us back.we ended up on the roof for most of the night.  we had the best time.  first of all, it was reggae night on the roof with a live band doing cover songs.  so we had a blast.  we went up there after a little while on the fourth floor.  we originally went up for air and ended up being up there the rest of the night.  we girls started dancing and the band called us over to dance in the middle.  so we all went over and eventually chris and phil joined it.  stacey, always hating to see someone left out, went over and beckoned mike to dance with her.  i swear, i've known the guy for about 14 years and never seen him dance.  he danced the rest of the night.  he and stacey danced the night away.  phil and i danced the night away.  all of us were out there on the dance floor for hours at a time.  it was really great because i haven't seen mike have such a great time in a long time.  phil and he got to kick back and relax, we all had a blast.  then after prana we went to ihop and had a 3 am breakfast.  twas a really fun night.  i think the coolest part was that it was one of the first nights since becoming a mom that phil and i got to go out and just be phil and i again instead of mom and dad.  not that i'm complaining, i wouldn't make a habit of it.  though it might be worth it to see phil and mike dance more often.  surprisingly enough, they both dance really well...  well, i knew phil did, he's danced with me before, but mike surprised the hell out of me.

father's day







so, i know i said that i was going to move from livejournal, but i decided that i'd stay in both places.  i am going to just copy and paste and blog in both places to keep in touch with the people i talk to in lj and the people i talk to in myspace.so, with that in mind....today is father's day.  i got up this morning with the baby and let phil sleep in.  mariana was an absolute sweetheart today.  phil and i love her so much.  my parents and brother, sister-in-law, niece and nephew, and phil's sister and her husband came over for dinner.  it was really really good.  i love the fact that my whole family can get together and have fun.  it's wonderful having in-laws and a family that think of each other as family as well.i made phil a picture of nana for father's day.  being low on funds, we sometimes have to get creative on gifts.  so, i took a picture of her this morning while he was asleep and used photoshop to edit the picture and create a new background and add some neat effects.  then i bought a 4 dollar frame, framed it, and gave it to him.  he loved it.  i spent hours on it this morning.  mariana sat at her little desk punching keys and moving her mouse around thinking she was doing it.i've sent in my fafsa and begun all of the prep to get back in college.  education degree here i come.i was thinking about it today.  two years ago the week before father's day i found out i was pregnant.  phil was a week away from turning 22.  now we're 24, well he will be tomorrow, and we have a beautiful little girl.  you know by the time i turned 24, i was supposed to own a house, have a degree, start my career, and just basically have everything in order financially.  sometimes i wonder what it would be like had we not gotten pregnant.  but, i saw phil today when mariana ran smiling and giggling at him with his father's day card in her little hand, and i realized something.  no matter what i do or don't accomplish in the rest of my whole life, i have truly been successful in all of the ways that truly matter.  i made phil a dad, and i created a beautiful life with him and god.  that's enough for me.current mood:  pleased

i'm happy







did you ever just wake up one day and see the sun shining and a blue sky, look around and think "i'm happy"?  well, i am.  i'm happy.  i can't think of a reason not to be.  my life is relatively uncomplicated.  i have a husband whom i love dearly and who loves me more than life itself.  my daughter is beyond the sweetest child in the universe.  i'm happy.i find that it is important to write days like today down.  this way if sometime next week, tomorrow, or even later today i get grouchy or discouraged about something, i can easily go back to this and say, "hey, you need to get back to that day."now, i'm also completely exhausted.  i desperately need to start finding my bed before 1:30 in the morning.  typically, it wouldn't be too huge a problem, but i do have to get up either with mariana or to take my cousin to summer school, depending on whose turn it is for which.last night i was levelling my alt and chatting on vent with flaitie, deadsabot and korrigan.  somehow the conversation turned into relationships and such...  it made me realize that i've never wanted to be with anyone other than phil.  well, that led to all of those questions men hate to be asked by their significant others...  "have you ever looked at another girl and though, 'damn i wish my girl had...'"   phil is a good sport, he knows that i am not going to get pissed and turn into a "i can't believe you'd want to change that about me" so he doesn't freak out with those conversations.  i don't ask to trap; i really do ask out of general curiosity.  however, that led to about 2:30 before we got to sleep.  so, i'm tired today.wow, this got long fast.  i rambled i think, i tend to do that.anyway, the point of all of this is.  i can safely say that i go to bed at night knowing that i am truly loved as me and that makes me happy!current mood:  happy

an update







so, i was informed that i need to keep updating this thing every once in a while.  i'm really bad about keeping journals, particularly if it's only for my own records.  but since people actually stop by and find out what's going on in my life with this thing, i'll try to be better about it.phil is doing really well with his new career.  last year he taught geometry and physics, but this year he will be teaching physics only.  the other physics teacher left the school and phil was given all of the physics classes if he wanted them.  since his degree is in physics, you can imagine he jumped at the opportunity.  he was also given the department funds to spend on "his program".  it's really rather exciting and it says a lot about his performance in his first year.mariana is getting huge.  she's rather tall according to the doctor.  she's already 16 months old as of the 8th of the month.  she walks everywhere, naturally.  she's even learned the concept of running away from you when she has something you are trying to take away from her.  i think the thing i love most about her is her laugh.  she's just so incredibly adorable when she giggles.  she's also beginning to assert her independence and prove that she's more stubborn than her mother ever was, hard to believe i know.i'm doing great.  i've applied for financial aid for the fall semester and am eligible for grants...  such is to be expected when you are a family of three on one income.  every once in a while not being rich pays off in a way.  so, i may get to go to school without deepening the ever growing amount of student loans.  i'm still going to get my degree in english education.  it has been quite a while since i was in college.  i will be taking online courses for much of my degree and then when i have no choice i'll consider actually going to a classroom.  i have no intention of going back to work right now and don't know when i will.  i'm in no rush and phillip loves me being home with mariana, so i have a lot of support.my health is on an incline.  i've only passed out once in the last 7 months.  4 of the last 7 months i've been completely without medication.  i do have one minor problem of a lost cardiologist.  but i'll get another one.  anyone know any really good electrophysiologists in florida?  :)mommy had surgery again.  i think it was on may 24.  she's recovering well, though she has a nurse come to the house everyday to clean her wound since the doctor doesn't want to close it up and risk another "fluid pocket" being formed.  all in all she's keeping her spirits high.  i'm very proud of her and i admire her greatly.  it's amazing how well she holds together despite all of the difficulties she has.the whole family is still addicted to wow.  we enjoy playing together very much.  in fact, last night we downed onyxia for the first time with our guild.  most people don't know what that means, but for those of you who do, we built our guild as family first and then added members until we grew to a point where together we could do end game in a fun casual way.  it's been a blast.  you can check us out at http://motuguild.net.oh and it's monday...  monday is zumba!!!  i love my zumba class.  i love the gym now.  but, honestly zumba is my favorite part of my weekly workouts.  caitie, meghan and i go dance off the calories.current mood:  mellow

well







i'm feeling much more secure with myself today...  i'm chalking it all up to hormonal issues or lack of sleep or something like that.anyway, i've had a very busy day.  today we took down the christmas decorations and put them away for another year.  then i cleaned mariana's room.  for someone who isn't very big she sure does accumulate a lot of stuff.  it's not easy to do stuff around the house with an 11 month old in tow.i can't believe she's 11 months old already.  she'll be a year old soon.  how crazy is that.  my little munchkin is getting bigger and bigger by day.well, i'm going to go relax for a little while.  i'm tired and i have a 5 man lbrs run planned for 7:30.  if you understood that last part, i like you even more.:)current mood:  satisfied
