have you ever seen the joseph cotton film 'portrait of jennie' (1948)? well, this place evokes the same wistfulness in me. i am so drawn to it.

print types & pricesall of my photographs are available either as limited edition gelatin silver prints* and/or as fine art poster prints^. sizes and prices (all sizes are total framed size):framed inkjet prints are printed on premium rag paper using pigment inks:14x11in €95  -   20x16in €195  -  26x20in €345framed hand developed, gelatin silver prints are museum quality, collectors images made in my darkroom by me:20x16in €595  -  26x20in €795* fine art prints are made by hand. they are developed by hand, by me, using traditional darkroom methods. each print is then treated with selenium to achieve museum quality archival permanence. these prints are for collectors of my work and are a labour of love to produce with each print taking six hours to make.this process is a happy marriage of science, craft, art and magic. all prints are signed and numbered. check out my darkroom here ^ poster prints are made using an inkjet printer. often referred to as giclee printing, this is a digital printing process in which an ink-jet printer is used to produce a high-quality art print. i print using epson pigment inks on canson edition etching rag paper to obtain the highest quality results. poster prints made in this way have comparable longevity to darkroom prints.  all prints are signed.
