"thank you so much for the very quick delivery - i wasn't expecting it for at least another week! as a mathematician and mathematics teacher who longs for the "good old days" in which pupils were given a thorough grounding in the basics underlying the subject (algebra and geometry), your books are a revelation! it is no small wonder that singapore students maintain their enviable success rate in mathematics at primary and senior levels when your curriculum is based around such wonderful books. they are packed full of searching and thought provoking examples and investigations that do not shy away from giving pupils challenging mathematics to deal with. for this the authors are to be fully commended. it's comforting to know that some departments of education are willing to entertain the (remote) possibility of some partial failures in a system having high-expectations for the greater good of the discipline, its teachers and of our future mathematicians. the alternative is so often to opt for inflated grades, shallow and lack-lustre syllabi, implemented all too often solely for political favour rather than the benefit of our pupils and their development. dr dabbs (uk)."
