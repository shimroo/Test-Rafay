quotes about my genuis


you misspelled genius. 
- rocket jones



current aim profile:



give me just a little more time 
and our love will surely grow
give me just a little more time
and our love will surely grow

life's too short to make a mistake
let's think of each other and hesitate
young and impatient we may be
there's no need to act foolishly
if we part our hearts won't forget it
years from now we'll surely regret it

you're young and you're in a hurry
you're eager for love but don't you worry
we both want the sweetness in life
but these things don't come overnight
don't give up cos love's been slow
boy, we're gonna succeed with another blow

give me just a little more time
and our love will surely grow
baby please baby
baby please baby

love is that mountain we must climb
let's climb it together your hand in mine
we haven't known each other too long
but the feeling i have is oh so strong
i know we can make it there's no doubt
we owe it to ourselves to find it out

just,
give me just a little more time
and our love will surely grow
baby, please baby
baby, please baby

i am not a jew, but if you google the word jew the first entry that appears is a whackjob site that hates jews, just for being jewish.  what's up with that nonsense?  so in an effort to keep that nitwittery from continuing, i'm placing the word jew here in my template, with links to the wikipedia entry for the word jew.
