toazted offers music interviews on demand. over time we have build a database of over 4000 unique interviews, half an hour each. new interviews are added daily. our interviews are being watched all over the world, by more than 10 million viewers monthly and still growing.
we cover every music genre. we talk to famous and not yet famous acts. the rolling stones, coldplay, muse, amy winehouse, martin garrix, the ramones, béyoncé, metallica, but also autechre, man or astroman, wool and many others have stood before our “mikes” and cameras.
we respect the people we interview. we know our audience and we respect them. we are authentic. we tell the truth. our journalists are music fans. they are knowledgeable, fun, but serious about what they do.
