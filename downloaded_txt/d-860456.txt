pierre perrier, national manager of transportation safety, purolator



















 










“at the ashley plant where we use the entire cority system, we see major benefits in analysis capabilities & in cross-referencing between different areas that were previously isolated. we wanted the same benefits on a divisional level. we wanted better capability to evaluate the entire business and to implement best practices through out every facility. today, we can look at divisional activity, view nonconformances at every plant, find the root causes, and develop permanent fixes.”
