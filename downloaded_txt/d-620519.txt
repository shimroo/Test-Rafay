health benefits



                    caviar has long since been considered a simple yet exquisite delicacy, appropriate for
                    celebrations along with a glass of fine champagne. yet salmon caviar, also known as
                    red caviar, is much more than a fancy treat to be savored only on special occasions.
                    red caviar can be served as a garnish or as a savory appetizer, for both elegant
                    and everyday meals.
                







about awers inc



                    in addition to possessing a delicate and exquisite taste, red caviar is also a hit with the
                    health-conscious. red caviar is an excellent source of dha and epa, the very omega-3 acids
                    that work to prevent heart disease, blindness, depression, premature birth and play an
                    essential role in the healthy development of one's brain and eyes.
