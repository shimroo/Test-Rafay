cushman motor scooters were built in lincoln, nebraska by the cushman motor works company. cushman had been building engines since 1901 and began making scooters in 1936. cushman scooters were a very popular means of transportation especially among teenagers and were also used by the military. there was even an airborne cushman model for use in wwii that could be dropped by parachute. visit the cushman scooter main page for lots more cushman information and photos.

crystal radios were invented in the late 1800’s and developed into practical use for radio reception in the early 1900’s. they use only the power of the received broadcast radio signals to produce sound and require no electricity or external power. tuned circuits are used to select the stations, and a crystal detector is used to rectify the radio station’s signal to enable it to be heard with a set of headphones.  early radio designs used a galena or other mineral crystal as a detector which gave them their name. visit the crystal radio main page for more information.
