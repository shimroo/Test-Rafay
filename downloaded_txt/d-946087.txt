weight loss tool*
   
tonic alchemy® as a weight loss tool*
   
a tablespoon of tonic alchemy blended into a nut or grain juice, or even pure water, is quite filling. add a half banana or other fruit to the blender, and it is likely you can go for hours without a meal or snack.
you may add 1-3 capsules of dragon herbs caralluma directly into the blender to extend the sensation of satiation and reduce hunger in the coming hours. no need to open the capsules if you are using a blender. dragon herbs uses “pullulan” capsules made from tapioca (a natural, non-gmo, easily digested vegetarian capsule). these pullulan capsules completely dissolve in a blender in less than 10 seconds. they are safe to consume for a lifetime.
so…just pop a couple of caralluma capsules into your tonic alchemy smoothie before your exercise. *
   








 
 




ashwagandha
  
did you know that ashwagandha is one of the major ingredients in tonic alchemy?
  
ashwagandha (withania somnifera) root, or sometimes referred to as “indian ginseng,” is an herb that is rejuvenating to the whole body. it rivals any tonic herb in the world.
ashwagandha is very highly regarded as a powerful adaptogenic herb: it helps humans adapt to adverse environmental factors, and helps the body and mind handle increased stress loads, both acute and chronic, more efficiently. ashwagandha has been demonstrated to improve learning, memory and reaction time. it supports healthy neurological functioning and cardiovascular health. it is very useful in mood support. it promotes relaxation but does not cause drowsiness.
