ocd action’s vision ocd action works for a society where ocd is better understood and diagnosed quickly, where appropriate treatment options are open and accessible, where support and information is readily available and where nobody feels ashamed to ask for help.
we are here because ocd tears families apart and leaves people isolated and exhausted. ocd ruins lives. it is a sad fact that many people with ocd delay seeking help. they put up with it for too long, perhaps thinking that nothing can be done or just not knowing where to turn. ocd action believes in taking action. we want people affected by ocd to seek help, to understand their treatment options and find the support and motivation they need to fight back. ocd is treatable, it can get better.
