20 years of evolving artistic music collaboration

                    tapegerm is a pool of source audio projects which artists (maybe you?) inject into new work. the sounds germinate via new compositions and new collections. a source can spread and be carried by 100's of works mutating in endless forms. currently there are 577 collaboration projects dropped into the pool by 57 artists, labels and publishers. 425 audio files are available from the tapegerm archive sourced from resident artist contributions as well as outsider art audio albums culled from cassette culture's past.
                
   
                    to get started, create an account, pick a project or game a random set of sources then create something new. upload your work and link your credits so your germ spreads throughout the site. if you want to contribute to the pool, let us know in the tapegerm group on facebook.

tapegerm 3: a web3 evolution of collaborative creativity in the nft space




                      
                      my last blog was a short bit about how tapegerm behaved like a dao. that was 2-3 years ago and while the nft space seems to consist of a few active communities, the interest has died since that time. but i still think tapegerm could transform itself into a decentralized web3 collective without much actual transforming of the idea. it was always that kind of thing. the change would be how the artistic exchange takes place and truly carry on in a decentralized manner. 
what follows is an...

the tapegerm dao: 20 years later




                      
                      tapegerm was formed as an autonomous organization which was fueled by pieces of audio as its mode of exchange.

restoration still run

                      
                      
buzzycompatriots-a change of term indicated since afficinadoes seems rather foreign, convertable into only metric terminology and wholly incompatible with domestic carrying capacities.
so far, the restoration continues unabated, both geoffrin and stolypin have successfully taken theirplaces on the mixery stage. no sudden rewrites, cancellations or writer's strikes have thusly brought down the curtain on things, although two or three sandbags hang concernedly like blunt and bulky swords of...

                                            love this track, nick. especially after using the spoken word source in my most recent gamegerm. i think it's beautiful how sources mix into different compositions. yours bounces around so cool.
