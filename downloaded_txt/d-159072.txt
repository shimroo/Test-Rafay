priorities of the southeast fisheries science center.

the southeast fisheries science center provides the scientific advice and data needed to effectively manage the living marine resources of the southeast region and atlantic high seas. we work closely with noaa fisheries southeast regional office to provide independent, objective science.our multidisciplinary research informs natural resource management. fisheries management councils, fisheries commissions, and federal, state and local agencies depend on our science to make decisions that protect and conserve the region’s living marine resources.our divisionsfisheries assessment, technology, and engineering supportthe fisheries, assessment, technology, and engineering support (fates) division provides essential services and development of new innovative technologies to support the center’s mission. fisheries statisticsthe fisheries statistics division provides extensive support to management and science through the collection, management, and dissemination of commercial and recreational fisheries statistics. the division works extensively with various internal and external partners to collect the fishery dependent information used to support marine resource management in the region.marine mammals and sea turtlesthe marine mammal and turtle division supports and conducts science that leads to improved knowledge and meaningful conservation of marine mammals and turtles and their habitats in a changing environment, helping to achieve noaa fisheries' mission of implementing the marine mammal protection act and endangered species act and making a positive impact on society.operations, management, and informationthe operations, management, and information division provides administrative and operational services including financial and acquisitions, information technology, human resources, facilities management, and safety and environmental compliance to support the center’s staff and research mission.population and ecosystems monitoringthe population and ecosystems monitoring division provides data, analytical products, research, and expertise to support noaa fisheries priorities. the division carries out fishery-independent surveys and applied research focused on fisheries and habitat ecology, and provides support for ecosystem- and climate-related initiatives in the region.sustainable fisheriesthe sustainable fisheries division works in partnership with fisheries managers and constituents to provide reliable scientific advice that enhances the stewardship of living marine resources. the division also strives to advance scientific knowledge and promote diverse and sustainable fisheries through innovative research and development activities, and the use of advanced technologies.interdisciplinary sciencewe work across these divisions and in collaboration with external partners to tackle complex issues requiring interdisciplinary approaches. these activities include conducting research to support ecosystem-based fisheries management, evaluating trade-offs in fisheries management to address competing objectives, using marine spatial planning to inform ocean use decision-making, studying the impacts of climate change to help prepare our fisheries and communities, and understanding the ecosystem impacts of major events such as oil spills.noaa sefsc: we are here for you (1:11)
