get to know modaoriginally formed in 1989, moda (museum of design atlanta) has grown and evolved over the years to become the only museum in the southeast dedicated exclusively to the study and celebration of all things design. we feature exhibits in all areas of design — such as architecture, graphic design, and more. our exhibitions empower people to design a better world and celebrate design as a creative force that inspires change, transforms lives, and makes the world a better place.
