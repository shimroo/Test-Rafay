what is classical education?

the core of classical education is the trivium, which simply put is a teaching model that seeks to tailor the curriculum subject matter to a child’s cognitive development. the trivium emphasizes concrete thinking and memorization of the facts of the subjects in grade school; analytical thinking and understanding of the subjects in middle school; and abstract thinking and articulation of the subjects in high school. subjects unique to classical education which help accomplish the goals of the trivium are grammar, the science of language usage; logic, the science of right thinking; and rhetoric, the science of verbal and written expression. classical christian education is further characterized by a rich exposure to the history, art, and culture of western civilization, including its languages (latin and greek), its philosophy and literature (the great books of western civilization and the christian tradition), and the development of a biblical worldview.

are you affiliated with a specific church?

alpha omega is a christ-centered, independent private school not affiliated with any specific church. to read our formal statements of faith and purpose, click on our statement of faith and/or statement of purpose.

do you have financial aid?
we understand the financial commitment necessary to attend aoa. to help families in this area, we work with facts business solutions for education, which is a third party company that evaluates each applicant based on financial information that you provide to them. upon review of the information, facts will make a recommendation for assistance. alpha omega academy offers grants to families based on these evaluations. our grants are limited because aoa is solely funded through tuition, registration, and curriculum. we do not receive any government or institutional funding.
if you are interested in applying, please visit our admissions page.

why does alpha omega emphasize latin?
alpha omega students take latin from 3rd through 8th grade. here are some reasons why latin is of such importance:

latin reveals a great deal about english and significantly enhances the student’s powers of expression in his native language.
latin develops and deepens the student’s understanding of and appreciation for their literature.
latin provides an understanding of the classical impact on our modern culture.
latin trains the student in the essentials of the scientific method: observation, comparison, and generalization.
latin provides a wonderful foundation for the study of other modern languages.


how can i get involved at aoa?
there are many ways to get involved at aoa and volunteers are important and valued! you can indicate your volunteer interests by filling out a pie (parent’s involved in education) form that is available on the website under the ptf tab. you can also contact any of the ptf officers (parent teacher fellowship) to volunteer. lunch volunteers are always in demand. call the school office to sign up. you can also let your child’s teacher know you’d like to volunteer.
please see the student handbook under “parent involvement” (page 13) for more specific ways to help.

will there be a lot of extra fees once i enroll at aoa?
there is a yearly curriculum fee and re-registration fee. junior high and high school students who participate in athletics will pay an athletic fee for each sport they play. occasionally, students are asked to pay a field trip fee. all fees are non-refundable.
