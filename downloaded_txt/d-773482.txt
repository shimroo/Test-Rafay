podperfectespresso pods

we developed podperfectespresso pods in 1959. pods are the best biodegradable choice for single serve solutions. your customers can brew espresso, filter coffee, and tea, in a variety of brewers from the lowest cost to top-of-the line professional machines. podperfect pods are paper and coffee so they do not fill landfills with bulk plastic or aluminum materials that take generations to dissolve. and podperfect pods cost less to make!

singlecupper® kcup

recyclable alternative to k-cups
singlecupper® k-cups are made of (#5 pp) polypropylene, a far better recyclable alternative for the environment than single serve plastic cups. patented upshot filters are fabricated with a unique surface brew screen and large interior coffee volume to brew a richer tasting coffee in a single cup format. your upshot filters are sealed with a pp clear film so your customer can see your coffee â a novel idea! and then either individually fresh sealed with a nitrogen flush to preserve their just roasted freshness â custom printed for you - or bulk packed in stand up zipper bags! we also offer a 2.0 lid material if required. keurig has discontinued marketing 2.0 machines. brew singlecupper in most k-cup single serve coffee brewers.

frequently asked questions


why single serve? choice, no waste, speed, ease of use, less clean up, less maintenance, fresh pack (nitrogen flush).
do we send you our beans? most roasters and brand holders do. but we can locally source fresh roasted beans or italian beans.
do you grind our beans? we custom grind your beans to meet your espresso brew specs. but for frac pack and k-cup coffee, save money by sending us your ground coffee.
do you provide samples? just ask. 610 828-6000 | email
what about 2.0? the freedom clip is an easy work around the 2.0 lock out. it is less costly than printed film which blocks customers from seeing your coffee through the clear lid
turn around time? we maintain an order queue that consistently runs about 10-12 working days.
how do you preserve freshness? we nitrogen flush every pouch using 2 nitrogen generators and driers supported by 2 turbine compressors.
can you print on the pouches? many roasters and brand holders opt to save money by using silver film which we can digitally imprint on.
quality control? we keep complete records of every project on file along with samples for 90 days.
there are many new entrants in this field. abcd has been in business since 1946. continental coffee (sara lee) chicago was our very first espresso co-packing customer!
