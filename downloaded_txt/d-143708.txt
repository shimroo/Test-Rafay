note on safety and appropriateness
- occasionally i receive concerns about the appropriateness and safety of 
some of these games, and opinions that certain games should not be on the site.  
after much thought and deliberations, i have decided to keep all the games on 
the site.
- some of the games (many of them in fact), can cause minor physical injury, 
including red rover, dodge ball, and others.  however, most have been 
played by children for many years, and in my opinion, minor injuries are part of 
growing up.  therefore i have decided to keep them and allow the reader to 
determine if they want to play.
- some of the games have stereotypes in them that were once tolerated but are 
now no longer appropriate.  keeping in mind one of the purposes of the site 
is to be a historical record, i will keep them on the site, but will be going 
through the list and adding a notation that the words used are no longer 
appropriate.  (for instance chinese school).  please keep in mind that 
originally in these games no harm was intended to any group, but our awareness 
level has improved significantly in recent years.
