history of the university of akron steel drum band 



dr. larry snider founded the university of akron steel drum band in 1980. at the time, it was one of only three colleges in the u.s. to have a steel drum ensemble. it is one of the nation’s oldest collegiate panorama style steel bands.,
for over forty years, all of the band’s steel drums were exclusively built and maintained by master tuner, dr. clifford alexis.  
this ensemble consists of percussion majors at the university of akron and is dedicated to performing the musical art form of trinidad and to educating people about the history of pan.
enthusiastic audiences have grown from about 50 in 1980 to over 2000 per performance, making this ensemble a major force in the cultural and entertainment community of akron and cleveland. 










 



 













hire us 



the 20 plus student ensemble is available during the academic calendar year and can perform one or two concerts per booking. we also can provide a workshop with students or guests including some “hands-on” activities. these concerts feature authentic caribbean music and an explanation of the history and development of the steelpan.
