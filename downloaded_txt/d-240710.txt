my true zero emission vehicle (tzev) toyota rav4 ev electric vehicle
and home are powered by the 100% renewable, zero emissions
electricity (zee) 30kwh/day
solar electric pv rooftop system.
investment payback in california of 6 years, 12% annual return.


san jose mercury news article solar electric (pv) and electric vehicles!
on page 27a of the print edition sunday, january 14, 2001 newspaper with photos.

one page, printable list of electric vehicle renewable / solar energy resources
electric vehicles / cleaner air

greenest vehicles omits honda ev+. note any electric vehicle
powered by 100% zero emissions electricity is a true zero emissions
vehicle (tzev), except for tire smoke :-),
such as my toyota rav4 ev which gets all of it's electricity
from my 6.2kw / 30kwh/day solar electric (pv) array. a tzev is the
cleanest. the green car data does not take into account all of
the upstream emissions involved in the drilling, transportationand refining
of gasoline or zev electricity. california grid recharged ev is 99%
cleaner than a gasoline vehicle. evs recharged with zero emissions
electricity is 100% cleaner than gasoline vehicles or any vehicle with emissions.
cng is the next cleanest.
hybrids are much dirtier than cng though much cleaner than gasoline.
diesel is the worst. even "clean / green diesel" emits toxic, carcinogenic
pollutants that get trapped in our lungs.

to the wheels. compressed natural gas is cleaner than the current
honda insight and toyota prius hybrids. only
