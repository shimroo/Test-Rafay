prophecy
the time of restoration of all things is now according to joel 2:25-29
ps 126: when the lord restored the fortunes of zion, we were like those who dream. 
then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing and shouts of joy. 
then they said among the nations, "the lord has done great things for them."
the lord has done great things for us; we are glad
restore our fortunes, o lord, like the watercourses in the negev!
may those who sow in tears reap with shouts of joy!
he that goes forth weeping, bearing the seed for sowing,
shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
acts 3:19-21: repent therefore and return, that your sins may be blotted out,so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the lord;  
and that he may send [again] yeshua the messiah, who was preached to you before,
whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, 
which g-d has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
 see "israel negev conference 2015" in the "prophecy" category. 

the virtual tabernacle
only the light of g-d’s word, shed on worldwide developments, events and treaties, enables us to see the truth, and to find the way of escape from this present state of corruption, from sin, death and wrath, into a new life with g-d.
