convention


















the upper midwest endurance and competitive rides association was formed with the goal of promoting the sport of endurance and competitive riding and good horsemanship under the direction of qualified veterinarians. furthermore, it was founded by a group of ride managers to standardize a set of rules for the various rides to reduce variation in the way rides were managed, to coordinate ride dates, to tally points, and to present year-end awards at an annual banquet. we host rides throughout the states of illinois, iowa, michigan, minnesota, north dakota, south dakota and wisconsin.
check out our schedule for the rides nearest you and for an entry form  if you wish to pre-register.
