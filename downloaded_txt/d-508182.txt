a brief overview of the alley’s history:





view fullsize










18th & 19th centuryelfreth’s alley was not included in original plans for philadelphia. as philadelphia became a bustling city, artisans and merchants purchased or rented property close to the ports where goods and materials arrived. this led to overcrowding, and landowners recognized that tradesmen needed alternate routes to the river. arthur wells and john gilbert opened a cart path between their properties, which stretched from front st. to second st., in 1703. the path later became known as elfreth’s alley, named after jeremiah elfreth, blacksmith and land developer.

20th centurythe heroic efforts of residents and local historians from the 1930s to 1960s preserved the alley as a typical colonial street, led by resident dolly ottey. ottey fought to combat deterioration of the alley in the early 20th century and lead efforts to form the elfreth’s alley association (eaa) in 1934. in the 1960's, the eaa secured national historic landmark status to ensure that interstate 95 construction did not eliminate elfreth’s alley from the landscape of old city, philadelphia.













21st centurytoday, elfreth’s alley is an “exceptional example of early american structures built between 1720 and 1830” according to the historic marker designated in 2016. the elfreth’s alley museum (located at houses 124 and 126) celebrates the working class of america who helped build this country through sweat and commerce. the alley is still a thriving residential community which is home to artists and artisans, educators and entrepreneurs, and everything in-between.
