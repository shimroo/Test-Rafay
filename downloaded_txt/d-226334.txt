dandie dinmont rescue


people occasionally inquire whether there are any dandies available due to being in a ârescueâ situation.  fortunately, there are very few rescue dandies looking for a âforever homeâ . 
however, when a dandie is in distress, it can count on the dandie rescue league to come to its aid.   learn more here






whatâs happening at montizard?
we are no longer showing or breeding the dandies, though they will forever be i#1 n my heart.  
we are planning for an anatolian shepherd litter in the spring of 2025. this will be a very exciting breeding and to learn more go to the news and litter info page.
