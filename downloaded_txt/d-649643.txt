"quality products have few real competitors"our namesake

 

the gentleman in the photos below is one albert c. “smokey” denmark. he is the founder and namesake of our company. he believed that making sausage is just about the most noble cause that a man can pursue. mr. denmark also practiced daily the idea that quality ingredients make a great sausage and that one should never, ever cut corners. we hold these same values as truth in our hearts to this very day.
