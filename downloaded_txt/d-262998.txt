beef brisket
our most award-winning menu item, and for good reason. our pitmasters have been known to smoke a brisket for up to 18 hours, and the result is so tender and juicy, you might think you've died and gone to texas.


 
order now 





 





pulled pork
we use our rub on a lot of our meats, but this is where that spice blend really shines. our pitmasters season whole pork shoulders by hand, smoke them for hours, and pull them to order. you can see it in the smoke ring: this pulled pork is the real deal.


 
order now 





 





bone-in chicken
our fan-favorite chicken is smoked on the bone, brushed with our original sauce, and finished on the grill for a crispy, caramelized skin.


 
order now 





 





smoked sausage
a proprietary recipe (i.e. you can’t get these anywhere else), our texas-style smoked sausage is a blend of beef and spices, all wrapped up in a natural pork casing for a crispy skin with the perfect snap.


 
order now 





 





turkey breast
sometimes simple is better. hormone-free turkey breast, salt, pepper, and hickory smoke: may not sound like much, but that's the recipe for the juiciest smoked turkey you've ever had.


 
order now 





 





st. louis-cut ribs
there's so much to say about our award-winning ribs: st. louis–cut, smoked for hours, grilled for moments, painted by hand with original sauce. it's hard to talk with your mouth full of award-winning ribs, though, so we usually just let them speak for themselves.


 
order now 





 





homemade sides
all the barbeque classics, plus some we think should be classics. baked beans, packed with brisket. corn pudding, a comfort food favorite. collards, bursting with fresh greens and smoked bacon. creamy slaw, full of hand-diced veggies in homemade dressing. find your go-tos and try something new, too.

your public smokehouse
you can smell the smoke around the clock: we’ve got three on-site smokers at every city barbeque joint and we never turn them off. our pitmasters use local hickory, years of experience, and all 24 hours of the day to craft the city’s best barbeque.
