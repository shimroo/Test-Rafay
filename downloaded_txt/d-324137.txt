you could get a cash reward of up to $3,000!
do you have information about a crime? emerald coast crime stoppers encourages members of the community to assist okaloosa and walton county law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime by overcoming the two key elements that inhibit community involvement: fear and apathy.
 
emerald coast crime stoppers provides a telephone number, web tips and mobile tips to encourage citizens in the community to volunteer vital information helpful to law enforcement agencies to fight against crime.
 
tipsters can remain anonymous and are eligible to receive a cash reward if the information given leads to an arrest or indictment.
 
rewards range from $50 to $3,000 depending on the severity of the crime, the number of offenders caught and the offences cleared up.
 
crime stoppers relies on volunteer directors and tax deductible contributions from the public in order to operate the administration of the program.
