myrtle beach bike week 2005 
5/13/2005 - 5/22/2005
2005 will be the 65th annual bike week at myrtle beach, sc. the third saturday of may is always the last saturday of myrtle beach bike week. approximately 200,000 bikers. 














the original biker tee features the official independent biker logo and free as the wind motto. this was the first logo ever declared to be the independent biker logo, so that makes it official. several motorcycle clubs which call themselves independent have started up and have logos now, but they cant claim their logo is the one and only independent biker logo, because this is it. we are currently out of stock but will take orders. biker gear



















bikers magazine and biker tee has no ties to organized crime.3/13/2005 raleigh, ncresearchers from canadas third largest univeristy, york university, recently listed a sister site of bikers magazine, biker tee, under the category of outlaw motorcycle gangs on their organized crime web links page. they were correct that it has links to one percent motorcycle clubs. however, so do many of the top sites, including the new motorcycle clubs directory at bikers. if it were worth my time, id ask york university to recategorize in order to make it clear that biker tee is not. id have to explain, and they wouldnt understand. for the record, bikers magazine is owned by independent bikers.
note: one percenters are serious bikers who ride every day. they work, have families, and have a reputation for riding hard and partying hard. the one percent patch does not imply criminal, outlaw motorcycle gangs, or organized crime. it implies dedication to their brotherhood and riding.

motorcycle magazines
if you are interested in motorcycle magazine subscriptions, go to bikers magazine. bikers who have been visiting biker tee for years all know that its owned by the same lady biker who publishes bikers. since bikers is an online magazine only, were not competing with easyriders or any of the other motorcycling magazine that is printed and sold in stores, so well be glad to fix you up with a subscription to any of the top cycling magazines. we even say really nice things about them as often as possible. 
like, back in the 60s, easyriders helped educate the world about the motorcycling community not being biker trash. they did this by just telling it like it is. i was reading through the internet a few years ago and found a thesis done about easyriders by some professor type. i think he was from pennsylvania or ohio. im not into most things that scholars have to say about bikers, but this one was actually interesting. (i wish i could find it now.) 
i believe the deals on motorcycle magazine subscriptions you will find at the bikers store are discounted and as good as youll find anywhere. it certainly beats what youd pay at a retail store. when youre done subscribing, yall come on back and order up a motorcycle t-shirt.

3/15/05 - i gave it some serious thought and decided to actually spend some money and time to give biker tee some serious improvements during the 2005 motorcycling season. if you think the current biker tee is just another yada yada place, you might want to bungy yourself to your seat and visit often. im so cheap that it usually holds me back, and biker tee was suffering as a result. ive got more time than money, so now that i spent a little money, biker tee is going to rock! please check back as it shifts into high gear.














oh, by the way, if anyone wants to set up their own shop on biker tee shops, its something we can make happen.
