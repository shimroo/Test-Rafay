breath of life

“when god is communicating himself to the soul, the mindâs natural field of vision has too narrow a range, and we have to engage by believing, not by focusing. were faith to open us merely to a world of sharper ideas or more vivid impressions, then its light would indeed look bright. as it opens us to god, its light blinds us. faith, then, is dark, not because god is distant, but because he is eye-close, soul-close.â
– iain matthew –












carmelite spirit the mission of the teresian carmel in the church is to live and bear witness to friendship with god.
