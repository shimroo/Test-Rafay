what do we offerour programschoose your age group









toddlers
our toddlers program is not meant to be merely a stepping stone on the way to preschool, but to address the needs and innate drives of our toddlers, those children from the ages of 18 months to 3 years.

preschool

vision & missionour valuesthe way to success


sunrise montessori schools are dedicated to educating children of the valley in the methods of maria montessori. it is our belief that all children have the ability and desire to learn. “our aim is not merely to make the child understand, and still less to force him to memorize, but so to touch his imagination as to enthuse him to his inmost core,” (maria montessori)
