welcome to glennie
offering your daughter the opportunity to explore and develop her unique passions and talents, providing her the personal attention she needs to be all she can be.



glennie’s individualised learning environment, together with the best contemporary teaching methods and dynamic growth and wellbeing programs, will offer your daughter the opportunity to explore and develop her unique passions and talents, providing her with the personal attention she needs to be all she can be.

as you are exploring education options, you are no doubt asking yourself which school is going to provide the best education for your daughter.

no two families will answer this question in the same way, just as no two girls are the same.

at glennie, we understand that each girl is an individual with her own distinctive strengths, challenges and interests and every learning pathway is truly unique. our vibrant and supportive community empowers each girl to be proud of who she is, building the confidence and courage needed to reach her full potential and create her own future.











a commitment to girl’s education
glennie girls are educated to the highest standards of which they are capable. in addition, glennie girls are given the opportunities to develop their sporting and cultural talents through a rich, diverse and relevant extra-curricular program.
by achieving an understanding of their own spiritual dimension, glennie girls will make a positive contribution to the world with a sense of their own worth and character, in addition to a well-developed sense of citizenship.
as well-skilled, well-rounded and well-grounded young people of excellent character and integrity, glennie girls will be able to be all they can be.
