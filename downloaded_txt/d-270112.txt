uniting our community
community impact is how we are investing in impact in our three pillars: basic needs, early childhood success, and workforce development. we have implemented a community impact model to ensure we are moving the needle in areas of most need, based on research and tracked insights. 







basic needs
basic needs are the non-negotiables in life. access to food so no meal is missed, stable housing, crisis assistance, mental health care, and more. 


learn more







early childhood success
without access to educational opportunities, many children fall behind before they even start kindergarten. providing children and families access to books, educational tools, healthy routine learning environments, parenting support and more is essential. 


learn more







workforce development
workforce development is the people-focused approach to a community’s economic success. offering trainings, tools, education and more focused on the workplace allows individuals to strengthen the region’s overall economy.
