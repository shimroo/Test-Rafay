our faqs 







 






does the dj use professional sound equipment suitable for the job you need done?

there is a big difference between the audio equipment you have at home and the equipment the professional dj uses. professional audio equipment is built to go on the road day in and day out. be sure to ask about the equipment, even if you aren’t “stereo smart” you’ll be able to tell the difference. also find out how long it will take for the dj to set up the sound equipment. if he brags to you he can have his station wagon unloaded and the system set up in less than 30 minutes do yourself a favor call someone else. this guy is not a dj.
stop asking for videos! are you kidding yourself? when will any dj send a videotape of a reception where no one danced or it was boring? all of these tapes are edited and in some cases professionally done with enhanced special effects only to trick you into thinking that ohio dj service was the greatest. most of the time all you have to do is ask your co-workers or family if they’ve heard of a certain dj you might be interested in. ask your hairdresser they talk wedding stuff all the time.







is the dj incorporated, registered and insured?

a dj who is registered, incorporated and or insured has taken the time and effort to show they are serious business people. it’s a good idea to stick with the established cleveland dj service, especially when planning a wedding.







can the dj provide a written contract and/ or references from previous clients?

i cannot begin to stress how important it is to get your booking confirmed in writing. all terms of the agreement should be in writing to avoid any complications at a later date. this insures you that the dj will show up. if you don’t have a contract, it’s a pretty good chance the dj might find a higher paying job and give you the slip. references are also an important part of any service business. upon request your dj should be able to provide you with current names and phone numbers.







will the dj be suitably dressed for the occasion?

how many times have you gone to a wedding reception and the cleveland wedding dj was dressed in blue jeans and a t-shirt. or worse he’s wearing a cat in the hat and weird sunglasses! folks it happens. it is important that your entertainer looks the part by dressing in formal or semi-formal attire, your preference. don’t assume the dj will be properly dressed. be sure to ask what he or she will be wearing..







is the dj willing to discuss music selections ahead of time, and is he willing to play requests?

a professional dj can’t possibly know everything there is to know about all music styles and entertainment. he should be willing to listen to your ideas and input and incorporate them into your event. he or she will listen to your requests and play them where they are appropriate. keep in mind if you have a lot of requests the dj may not be able to play all of them. believe it or not there are some dj services that will not play any requests. also beware of services that have you fill out a song request list. often this is the only music they will bring. so if you want to hear something you forgot to write down, they probably won’t have it. it’s also important to have a variety of music especially at a wedding; styles like disco, polkas, country, jazz, big band, pop, r&b, motown, line dances etc.

















does the dj know the proper etiquette and procedure for your type of occasion?

a professional dj will become involved in the planning of your function and will be prepared to handle any announcements or special events on that day. a guideline of the formalities should be discussed ahead of time. a lot of events occur at a reception from introductions, to the toast and all the special dances. being unprepared or unfamiliar with the type of event is a recipe for disaster.







will the dj arrive on time? how many times have you heard about the dj being late, or not even showing up?

this is probably because they are unreliable, or it happened because the dj booked an event before yours and ran overtime. make sure the equipment is set up prior to any guests arriving and ready to start when you want them too. too many times due to poor planning the dj shows up in the middle of dinner to unload and set up, very tacky and a bad idea.







can the dj supply back-up equipment or a replacement disc jockey in case of an emergency?

this is really scary if half way through the party something happens to the sound equipment, what will you do? well if the dj doesn’t carry a back-up system the party is over. if the dj has a back-up system the party is only interrupted for a few minutes while he changes a component or replaces the system. even professional equipment can fail on occasion, so it is very important to know whether your dj has a spare system available to them. any number of circumstances may arise between the times you booked your dj till the time of the event. make sure the dj has a back-up plan in case of illness or accident.







does the dj charge mileage or a set-up fee?

you should be cautious of dj’s that charge for mileage if they travel less than 50 – 75 miles. their price should be consistent so everyone pays the same. just because you have your reception at the country club doesn’t mean the dj can inflate the price.







has the dj ever cancelled a show?

if they have, they may be double booking shows and taking the one that pays the most.  or worse are they subcontracting numerous weddings for the same day? save yourself the stress if a dj has a history of canceling shows yours could be next.
