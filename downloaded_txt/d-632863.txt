i could live herefor years



								thank you for the most enjoyable stay. this is an amazing spot, we have travelled a lot and this is one of the best. not only is africa beautiful but the surroundings and people at tongabezi are the perfect representation of this land.
							
- mr & mrs matt





tranquil, breath-taking & relaxing lodge onthe edge of the zambezi



							the staff is surely the lodge’s biggest asset! we were a group of 6 ladies, who thoroughly enjoyed the lodge. a visit to the school is a must, what green safaris do for the community is clearly visible, and that is what green safaris is all about - community.

what is tongabezi best for?








romance
in the early 1990’s, the new york times called tongabezi, “a place worth getting married for”’. we’ve been perfecting the art of making you swoon for over thirty years.






private travel
there is no need to share your luxury zambian safari with anyone but friends and family when you stay at tangala private house or in one of our family-sized rooms. you can even book private guides, game drives, and river cruises.






family travel
tongabezi was created by a family and has grown into an even bigger one. our team are expert childminders, we are always happy to tailor our menu to little taste buds, and the river is an endless source of activities.






solo travel
tongabezi is a short drive from victoria falls and nestled on the most tranquil stretch of the zambezi. whether you travel solo to experience culture, community, and adventure, or to spend time quietly in nature, we have you covered.
