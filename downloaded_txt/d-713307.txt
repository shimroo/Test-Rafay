our mission
at the cris collinsworth proscan fund, our mission is two-fold.

we are dedicated to the fight against breast cancer in the cincinnati tri-state community by providing critical education, unwavering support, and early detection services, including free mammograms and breast mri for eligible dense breasted patients.

simultaneously, we are deeply committed to empowering the next generation. through the strategic game of chess, we instill self-esteem, nurture sportsmanship, and foster critical thinking skills in children. our mission is to save lives and shape futures.
