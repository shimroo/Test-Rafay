the colonial market




























      during the american colonial period the market was a place for various merchants and craftspeople to display and sell their wares. now the internet and the world wide web have almost taken over the roll of the old markets.
      because of the increased popularity of the internet, businesses now need a web site more than ever. some small businesses, individual craftspeople or artisans might not have a need for a large expensive website. this is why the colonial market was created. to help those who would like to get their name out there and have a web presence but who don't need their own .com name and would like to highlight their business rather than their entire product line on the web.

the following sites are hosted here:
