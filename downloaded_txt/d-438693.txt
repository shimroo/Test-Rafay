					the newest kool music survey is here					








every month, we take 40 songs from our big playlist and ask for your opinions.  your votes help determine whether we keep playing a song, play it less, or not play it at all.

over time, you'll be helping us put together a mix of classic hits that (almost) everyone will love.
(we say "almost" because there's always some negative nabobs out there...)

let us know what you think of the 40 songs on the survey this month!
