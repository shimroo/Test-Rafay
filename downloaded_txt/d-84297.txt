article

              los angeles – lydia cornell, a *best actress nominee at method 
              fest for the indie film “miss supreme queen”, is also 
              an accomplished political writer, novelist and comedienne. she recently 
              guest-starred with larry david on hbo’s “curb your enthusiasm”; 
              wrote and produced her own film venus conspiracy, and had leads 
              in the feature films “nooner” erik attias’ pbs 
              play, and “dean and nancy”, along with steven tyler 
              and jon bon jovi. she also hosted the  world travel awards in 
              barbados with the sopranos’ michael imperioli, curb’s 
              cheryl hines, and law & order’s richard belzer. 
              in addition to her new book of political essay,"how to talk 
              to ann coulter, if you must", lydia’s new book falling 
              up, is based on her humiliating adventures in hollywood and spiritual 
              growth. it is being developed for the stage. 
              winning the people's choice award, lydia starred as "sara rush”, 
                        ted knight's daughter and audrey meadows’ granddaughter, in 
                        the hit 80’s show too close for comfort — a top rated 
                        abc series that has been in worldwide syndication for years. just 
                        released on rhino dvd, the show has attained cult status, with fans 
                        all over the world exchanging her trading cards. lydia is fluent 
                        in spanish and comes from a family dedicated to the arts. her great-great 
                        grandmother was harriet beecher stowe, author of uncle tom’s 
                      cabin. a 
                        children’s advocate, ms. cornell is passionate about helping 
                        orphans and underprivileged children. her other passion is fighting 
                        drug and alcohol abuse. profits from her ventures go to various 
                        children’s charities, including give kids a break, girls inc. 
                        and feed the children. lydia is also an inspirational public speaker. 
                        with a humorous and spiritual point of view, she talks about how 
                        she overcame a life-threatening tragedy that brought her to the 
                        depths of despair — and found the key to bliss. now married 
                        with two sons (jack, 11 and kevin, 9) she describes her hollywood 
                              experience as a crash-and-burn, then a “catastrophic” 
              spiritual awakening. “it was supernatural,” says lydia, 
              “i now have tangible evidence of a force beyond anything in 
                              the material world. i believe that the purpose of suffering is to 
                              bring us closer to our spirit. getting rid of the ego is a big part 
                              of it, and in hollywood, which is run by massive egos, this is not 
                              easy — we reflect each other. alcohol & drugs are just 
                              a cover for extreme insecurity.”
ms. 
              cornell spent years as a single mother going through the horrors 
              of the hollywood dating scene. after getting dumped by a series 
              of schmucks, she completely gave up on men. through what can only 
              be described as “a prayer miracle”, she met her future 
              husband the next day — and subsequently inherited a stepson, 
              kevin, who was born with osteogenesis or “brittle-bone” 
              disease. fortunately, he is now in remission. “this family 
              is the biggest gift of my life. 
 
 
 
and though marriage in a blended 
                  family isn’t easy, i think you’re supposed to be married 
                  to the person who annoys you the most. the most spiritual growth 
                  happens with your enemies!” she says jokingly. (“the 
                  arabs and israelis are next door to each other for a reason, they 
                  just don’t get it yet.”) 
lydia 
              also wrote a novel, the sylvia plan, an international thriller based 
              on the true story of one of stalin’s most complex assassins: 
              the man who killed trotsky. it takes place in paris, barcelona and 
              mexico and is a reverse mata hari tale with an oedipal twist — 
              focusing on the assassin, his mother and the innocent woman he seduces. 
              mercader was a chameleon that could change identities at will. in 
              cuba, he trained lee harvey oswald in spy tactics and guerrilla 
              warfare. lydia also went to beirut, lebanon during the war and us 
              magazine published her “beirut diary”. like spalding 
              gray, lydia also does a form of monologue comedy, based on tragic 
              experiences in her dating life. her one-woman show relationshop 
              played to sold-out audiences in los angeles. 
lydia’s 
              frustration with the media compelled her to write the film venus 
              conspiracy, about a plot to keep women thin and insecure. the lead 
              character, a “recovering blonde”, in withdrawal from 
              being a cleavage-wearing bimbo, laments, “all human suffering 
              is caused by victoria’s secret!” lydia teamed up with 
              her former co-star deborah van valkenburgh for the film. ironically 
              both actresses portray sisters in “venus” as they did 
              some twenty years prior. “working with deborah again was the 
              most fun i've had ever,” explains lydia, “we laughed 
              until we cried.” this zany, poignant comedy-thriller in the 
              vein of “dr. strangelove” and “mr. smith goes 
              to washington” clearly sends a message to all women, “women 
              have never achieved as much as men because they spend too much time 
              putting on makeup!” through venus conspiracy lydia is hoping 
              to raise awareness among young women and girls – that the 
              beauty industry exploits them and deliberately makes them obsolete 
              when they reach 30 years old. “i actually know nine-year old 
              girls who are obsessed with their wrinkles! and weight!” ms. 
              cornell herself suffered years of unemployment and lack of faith 
              in herself once she hit 30 — and had many experiences being 
              rejected as an actress and worrying about body image and weight. 
              “a lot of it was in my head — but i actually fainted 
              from fear at an audition once. of course my jeans were so tight 
              i hyperventilated, but being critiqued for every flaw on your body 
              is demoralizing.” 
lydia 
              often had to dress like a hooker for movie roles (hollywood loves 
              to glorify them in films like “pretty woman”) and once, 
              on her way to an audition, she was actually mistaken for a hooker! 
              “maybe it was the dog collar and leash i was wearing.” 
              in retrospect, these incidents are hilarious, but at the time, not 
              so funny. “they objectify women, paint us into a corner. and 
              only by gaining faith in ourselves and enriching our interior lives 
              can we combat this social programming. but still, there really may 
              be a plot – a very sexist plot to dumb women down. i mean, 
              why is paris hilton famous? it’s possible that we are all 
              being brainwashed and kept in fear so they can make money off our 
              insecurities.” women shouldn’t be made to feel defective 
              if they don’t look like a playmate or a supermodel. as one 
              of her characters in venus states: “why do we perpetuate the 
              myth that the only valuable women in society are teenage, wombless 
              buttless mutants?” incredibly, lydia has developed 40 episodes 
              from “venus” as a comedy series about spiritual growth. 
              
lydia 
              has been a recurring celebrity guest on pbs’ think-tank di 
              palma forum and speaker on drug and alcohol abuse. she supports 
              research on behalf of the miami project to cure paralysis, children 
              affected by aids, habitat for humanity, and missions at bel air 
              church. she was recently profiled on inside tv, a&e biography,
