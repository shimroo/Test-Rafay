usa triathlon has transitioned to a new membership hub, which went live on june 2 and can be found at member.usatriathlon.org.

	                    head to the hub to access your usa triathlon profile, renew or upgrade your membership, view your membership card, search for a coach or club, read the latest training tips from certified coaches, and more.
	                    all members are asked to activate their accounts in the new membership hub for security purposes. if you have not activated your account yet you will be prompted to create a new username and password, 
	                    which will serve as your login information for the new membership hub, when you go to member.usatriathlon.org. when creating your username and password, you are welcome to use the same membership log-in credentials you are using in the current system as long as your password is at least six characters.
