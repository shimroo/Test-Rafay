recipe ~ decadent frittata





for mother's day i hosted a family brunch and made a big ol' frittata which everyone enjoyed with fresh fruit, a slice of buttered cornbread, and delicious hot coffee.

1/2 onion, chopped1/2 orange bell pepper, chopped1 tomato, chopped8 sun-dried tomatoes, sliced8 eggs, beaten
sea salt and black pepper1/4 cup cheddar cheese, grated4 marinated portobello mushrooms, sliced1/4 cup soft goat cheese, crumbled

in an oven-proof frying pan (or cast iron pan), heat some butter and olive oil. fry the onion and peppers until translucent. add the fresh tomato and sundried tomato and cook a few minutes, seasoning with a little salt and pepper.in a medium bowl, beat all the eggs together with some salt and pepper (i also added a splash of milk). mix in the grated cheese. pour over vegetables in the frying pan and cook a few minutes without stirring. meanwhile, distribute mushrooms and goat cheese over the top. when the edges of the eggs are able to pull away from the pan (about 5 minutes over medium-low heat), place the pan in the oven on the center rack and broil for 5 minutes.

for lunch, eat a slice stuffed into a pita with greens, or enjoy with a salad. to turn this into a dinner, serve with steamed veggies or sauteed rapini and boiled or roasted baby potatoes.

serves 8.

note
if you don't have marinated portobello mushrooms, use marinated button mushrooms (maybe 20 or so). but if all you have is regular mushrooms, saute in butter in a separate pan, then add to the frittata along with the goat cheese before broiling. 

variations
i think this would also work great with any of:Â 
spinach, arugula, feta, dill, shallots, leftover steamed potato

recipe ~ zucchini & shiitakes on noodles







after a long craving for all these ingredients in one dish, i made this noodle bowl that hit the spot on a mild summer night.



2 tbsp olive oil
1 zucchini
8 shiitake mushrooms
6 whole garlic cloves, peeled
sea salt
fresh ground pepper
goat feta or soft goat cheese
cooked noodles


put noodles on to cook. i used corn linguini, though i can picture this dish with any noodle you love.

cut the zucchini in half lengthwise, then cut into half-rounds about 1/2 cm thick or less. heat 1 tbsp oil on a pan, and saute zucchinis plus whole garlic cloves over medium heat for a few minutes.

cut off and discard the stems of the shiitakes. add the other tbsp of olive oil to the pan along with the mushrooms. season with salt and pepper, and saute another 5 minutes, until cooked and lightly browned.

when the noodles are cooked, drain and add to the pan. toss everything together. you may want to add another dash of salt of pepper, or a drizzle of olive or flax oil. serve onto two dishes and dot with the goat cheese.

serves 2. 


variation: tomato basil
make a mixture of chopped tomato and minced fresh basil, stir with crumbled goat cheese, and top the noodles with this mixture.

recipe ~ colourful quinoa







my apologies for not posting photos, but visualize these ingredients and trust me that it's a delightful side-dish, warm or cold!



1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 heaping tbsp currants
sea salt
1/2 tomato, diced small
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup parsley, chopped
1 tsp butter (use olive oil for a dairy free recipe)
juice of half a lemon 
2 tbsp slivered almonds


place quinoa in a small pot and add 1 1/2 cups of water, the currants, and a pinch of sea salt. bring to a boil, lower to simmer and cook covered for 20 minutes.

meanwhile, chop the tomato and herbs. set aside. in a dry pan, lightly toast the slivered almonds, then set aside.

when quinoa is done, fluff with a fork and stir in butter. transfer to a large serving bowl and add tomato and herbs. squeeze the lemon juice over all, add another sprinkle of sea salt, and toss together. garnish with almonds (can also use raw walnut pieces).

serves 3.

recipe ~ simple kamut pasta with chives







the weather is cool and wet (kapha qualities), time for some pungent, warming foods (with pitta qualities)!



2 cups kamut spiral pasta

1/4 cup minced fresh chives

1 clove garlic, minced

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

salt to taste

paneer or soft goat cheese, optional



bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook pasta until soft, about 12 minutes. when done, drain and return to the pot.



combine the minced chives and garlic in a small bowl, stirring in the olive oil and salt. stir this mixture into the cooked pasta. sprinkle in the paneer or goat cheese if using, and gently toss. if using cheese, add some fresh ground black pepper to help make the cheese more easily digestible.



serve with a mixed green salad with tomatoes and basil, or as a side dish to grilled or roasted dishes.



serves 2 to 3.
