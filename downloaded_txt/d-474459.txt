	 what sets us apart?
	 
    


we sell guns. lots of guns.


others claim they have 'over 1/2 million dollars of guns[sic]'

we would like to have that much inventory, but we're busy selling it and buying more! 

so, you've got to ask yourself...


do you want a firearm that has been handled
for months and months or do you want one that
is factory fresh?
