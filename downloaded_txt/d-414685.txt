for patients 











									plastic surgery is a safe and fulfilling experience in properly trained hands. key to this is the selection of your plastic surgeon and a good place to start is checking whether the surgeon is a board certified plastic surgeon because not. every doctor is a surgeon and not every surgeon is a board certified plastic surgeon. in all european states there are national regulations for multiyear training in plastic surgery requiring appropriate experience with set numbers of operations in each subspeciality of plastic surgery and success in a final exam. only board certified plastic surgeons have completed these national programs and you can find them through the national society for plastic surgery in your country here:
