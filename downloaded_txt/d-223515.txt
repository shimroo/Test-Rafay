chicago hamburger company- arcadia’s neighborhood burger joint 



welcome to the chicago hamburger company, inc. we’re a chicago style sandwich joint serving sliders, , vienna hot dogs and polish, char-broiled burgers and sandwiches, wings, salads, and more since 1975. we also offer old fashioned milkshakes (you know, the kind you have to make), and soft drinks. we’re a very family friendly environment, with kid menus, a claw machine, and ms pac-man for those who are never satisfied with their highest score. we keep a couple of tv’s tuned to sports, with phoenix and chicago teams getting the most airtime. 



we’re also a great place for lunch during your work day. it’s an easy way to unwind too, huh? call us ahead and we’ll have your carry-out order ready when you arrive, or order online thru chownow right from this site. if somebody in your group has special dietary concerns, we offer many broiled chicken and turkey options. we also offer a great veggie burger, three cheese sub, and salad for the non-meat society. c’mon in once. we’ll do our darndest to turn you into regulars.
