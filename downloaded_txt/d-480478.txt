        about       

dublin, first called monadnock no. 3, was one of the townships laid out by the masonian proprietors as part of an elaborate 18th century real estate speculation. the town dates its founding to 1752, when william thornton built and occupied a cabin just this side of the peterborough line, on the edge of what is now the macdowell reservoir. thornton, however, left after a year or two, and the first permanent settlers, all descendants of ulster protestants, arrived some time after 1760.
