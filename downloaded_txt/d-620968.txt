safari arms, ltd.
custom made by craftsmen, not mass produced by machines 






ammunition trusted for the hunt of a lifetimewe have been custom loading superior, precision ammunition since 1988 for discriminating hunters who realize that the success of their entire hunt, whether it be a once in a lifetime marco polo sheep hunt, an african safari for lord derby eland, or a local outing for deer, depends upon the performance of their ammunition. if your ammunition does not perform perfectly, and you fail to take your game cleanly, then all of the time and money you have invested will have been wasted. all things considered, your ammunition, while being the single most important part of your entire hunt, can be the least expensive single item even when using the best precision loaded ammunition available. why take a chance with factory ammunition that was produced at a rate of several thousand rounds per hour by a machine? our ammunition can be trusted for your hunt of a lifetime!

grand slam!
congratulations to mike k. on his grand slam of north american sheep!mike used his 300 remington ultra magnum with ammunition loaded by safari arms.





the custom experienceall ammunition produced in our custom shop is hand loaded- one cartridge at a time. whether you order one box or ten, each cartridge is individually sized, prepped, and loaded. this meticulous process cannot be replicated in any mass-producing factory, where an excess of 5 million rounds of ammunition are produced daily.for over 30 years, safari arms has been precision loading some of the most accurate ammunition available in the industry. our time tested production process has been proved many times over, and delivers unmatched accuracy and consistency across all calibers.



is there really a difference?we have been asked many times if there truly is a difference between our custom loaded ammunition and factory loaded ammunition. the answer- yes! every cartridge is put through a 10 stage case preparation process and a dual stage cleaning and polishing process before being loaded. furthermore, each of our powder charges is weighed on a precision digital scale that is accurate to one tenth of one grain (0.1gr.)



is your hunt worth $2.00?you've done everything you can to prepare for this moment. you found the best guide, clothing, and equipment for the hunt you desire. you practiced your shot for countless hours so you were ready when the trophy of a lifetime is in view. now it's finally time to pull the trigger, and the success of your entire hunt is dependent on the performance of a single cartridge. our custom and precision loaded ammunition averages just $1 or $2 more per round as compared to premium factory loaded ammunitionevery dollar spent on your hunt is dependent upon the performance of that one single cartridge in your chamber. the entire hunt will be lost if that cartridge fails to perform as expected.why trust the hunt of a lifetime to ammunition loaded by machines at a rate of thousands per hour? do you really trust a product that is almost untouched by human hands?



precision loaded vs. factory loadedfactory loaded ammunition is loaded at a rate of thousands of rounds per hour. in order to achieve these production numbers, factories forego loading techniques that are critical for attaining consistent performance and precision. one of these techniques is individual powder charge weighing. while factory ammunition is loaded by machines that measure powder charges by volume, our custom shop hand weighs each powder charge.










powder charge weights recorded from a deconstructed box of factory ammunition purchased from our local sporting goods store. there was a variance of 1.6 gr. across the ten rounds measured



 








this image illustrates the amount of powder contained within 1.6 gr. we used a barnes .223 t.s.x. 53 gr. bullet for scale.





the result?more consistent performance and an elevated level of precision.










our production process allows us to achieve near equal powder charges, where variances never exceed one tenth of one grain.



 








this image illustrates the maximum variance in powder charge weights in safari arms custom loaded ammunition. the only reason a variance exists is because our specialized digital scales guarantee accuracy within 0.1 gr.
