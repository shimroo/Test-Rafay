  does your website perform?


  ours do.


  for your website to perform, you need three things to occur:





traffic
you need qualified traffic directed to your website.




trust
your website needs to impart trust upon the visitor.




conversion
the visitor must be converted into a sale or enquiry.


if your website isn’t working for you, consider these three aspects and use them to analyse your current website.
perhaps you haven’t yet delved into an online venture; these three factors must be woven into your business plan if you wish success for your website.


cityofcairns.com realises the importance of these issues. our web design and search engine optimisation services reflect this; hence every one of our clients’ websites are designed, developed and optimised with the traffic, trust and conversion issues in mind.


traffic

search engine optimisation


cityofcairns.com specialises in search engine optimisation (seo), the process of refining a website to enhance its ranking in search engines. search engines provide over 85% of traffic to most websites, and without an effective search engine optimisation strategy this traffic is going to your competitors.


  traffic in websites is a general term used to describe anyone who visits your site, and this can be measured in a number of ways. you would have heard statements such as ‘my website receives over 10,000 (insert incredibly large number here) hits per day’ however we prefer to measure traffic in a more accurate, and more fair way by counting unique visitors. hits will never indicate a site’s marketing is successful, but the number of incoming unique visitors will.

trust

aesthetic, suitable web design


  customers don’t return to a business if they feel uneasy about how a business is portrayed. neither do online shoppers. in fact, since the internet is a reasonably anonymous place to carry on business and many fraudsters take advantage of this, extra effort is required to convince an online shopper you are a reputable business. hence, cityofcairns.com designs clean, professional websites, aesthetically suitable to the feel of your business. we’ll even take some liberties.


  rest assured, we work with great care to ensure our web design reflects your business’ image and project it in the best light.

conversion

appropriate copy, seamless usability


  conversion determines website profitability. regardless of how much traffic any website receives, if it fails to offer any incentive to enquire or buy or the visitor decides they aren’t interested, the website is worthless.


cityofcairns.com ensures website copy is positive and conducive to a high conversion ratio. we can arrange an internet business viability analysis for the selling of products or services online, and recommend adjustments to vending models as necessary for a smooth transition online.

  why us?


  we understand how business works on the web. we recognise a flashy design is pretty at best without a marketing strategy to drive traffic into a website. conversely, we realise there is little point obtaining thousands of visitors to a site which looks like the second website attempt of your best friend’s nephew. cityofcairns.com create professional, aesthetic, functional websites that rank at the very top of the search engines and we do it at a price every business can afford.


  we specialise in small business web design in australia because we believe this market is highly suited to the web yet hasn’t been fully embraced by businesses; it is just beginning to shine. entire industries are unsaturated, yet the customers are there and waiting.


cityofcairns.com exists to assist business owners achieve their online goals, just as we have for other australian businesses.


cityofcairns.com is an established, specialised web design company providing a range of web-oriented services for small to medium businesses in australia and around the world. initially founded by nicky jurd and kaj haffenden, the cairns-based web design and marketing company has since grown to a team of 18 experts, each providing a set of skills and competencies that allows the company to deliver a complete set of design, development, programming and marketing services to our clients. these services include:



web design and development


search engine optimisation


internet marketing


search engine and internet marketing training

programming and database development



  there is no other web design or web development firm in cairns australia that specialises in creating or moulding websites for search engine suitability and customer usability. our websites generate qualified traffic. qualified traffic generates profit. we have acutely monitored, researched and studied the successes and failures of websites in the dot-com industry, both in cairns and around the world. this has enabled us to develop e-business and internet marketing strategies which are both affordable and profitable.


  our business was not born because we run an e-business and decided that we would ‘have a go’ at web design. nor are we computer geeks with an inability to communicate. rather, we are a team of internet professionals, the directors of which each have over 8 years of web design experience. the company has designed, managed and marketed more than 500 websites in cairns and throughout australia. we speak your language, and explain the web in terms you will understand.


  we know what makes a profitable website, and it is our business policy to only build a website if we believe it would prove profitable. ultimately, websites need not be a ‘must have’ advertising expense, but rather are a proven marketing performer, and it is our personal goal that every website in our portfolio is a winner.


  please enjoy reading through the article below about about how we enhance a website’s performance, and other information we have prepared on our website. when you are ready to begin seeing measurable results from your website, give us a call on (07) 4033 7811 or email info@cityofcairns.com. we can’t wait to exceed your expectations.
