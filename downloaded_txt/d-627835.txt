meet our ministers

rev. amy zucker morgenstern has served with uucpa since 2003. with a fascination for the big questions and a passion for social justice, amy helps us to create a community where we treat our differences--of theological language, spiritual practice, chosen metaphor, life story--with respect and interest, so that they can enliven our shared journey.
rev. catherine (cat) boyle joined us in 2022. embracing wonder, embracing curiosity and embracing life is her credo. cat's background in theater shows up in her creativity in religious education, and infuses her worship with energy.
learn about all our ministers here.

justice partner

justice partner - showing up for racial justice (surj)
the justice partner for february is showing up for racial justice (surj)
surj sacred heart chapter is based in san jose and is part of a national network of groups and individuals organizing white people for racial justice. there are over 150 surj chapters and affiliates nationwide. through community organizing, mobilizing, and education, surj moves white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice, with passion and accountability.  accountability means being in relationship with and taking direction from people of color and working on the issues that matter most to accountability partners, organizations run by people of color.
website: www.surjatsacredheart.org




we gather on unceded, stolen land of the tamien and ramaytush people. we acknowledge these communities in the interest of truth and justice, awareness and gratitude. in order to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism, we pledge to join the tamien and ramaytush people whenever they ask us for solidarity.
