“made the house buying experience painless! an extremely knowledgeable team that has decades of experience. would highly recommend cerrito realty and will use them again in the future.”
 

mike p

















"i worked with mike on a short sale recently and found him to be creative, persistent and incredibly knowledgeable. there are a large number of realtors out there but very few of mike's caliber. i would recommend him without hesitation."
 

bowie, md













"after several realtors not selling our home, we selected michael as we found out that his father sold us our very first home. he was nothing short of amazing. he brought people to our home that were qualified. he was in contact with us almost daily to keep us advised of where things stood. after selling our home, we moved to pa. we only wished he was in pa to find us a home. love this guy. you can't go wrong with michael."
