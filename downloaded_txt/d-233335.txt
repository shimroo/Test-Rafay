what is the world's greatest reading?

editor eric's flagship literary list, the greatest literature of all time, presents the world's greatest works from ancient to current yearsâfrom all countries, cultures and genres.
and that's just the beginning. also offered are equally comprehensive lists delving into the world's greatest novels, stories, poems, plays, nonfiction and other literary forms, as well as the top works in the most popular genres, such as historical fiction, crime and mystery, science fiction, fantasy, thrillers, horror, romance and alternative history.
plus, for those interested in great literature from certain parts of the planet, we delve into a growing number of greatest lists for specific countries and regionsâtwenty-four so far.
those who have asked for a more concise guide to the greatest literature get their wish with the ranked top 99 works of literature. meanwhile, for those aiming to explore the world's literature in greater breadth than offered in any of our other lists, the really long list of great literature has been created.				
how was it done?
more than a quarter century of research among readers, writers, critics and scholars has gone into creatingâand continually updatingâeditor eric's lists of great literature.

going, going, gone flat
				around the turn of the  twenty-first century, we had a spate of bestsellers with "girl" in the titles: girl, interrupted (1993), girl with a pearl earring (1999), the other boleyn girl (2001), the windup girl (2009), gone girl (2012), the girl on the train (2015), the girl with the dragon tattoo (2005) and its similarly named sequels.... gone girl
selling the good book for fun and profit
				when they got around to making the movie of elmer gantryâmore than three decades after the novel came outâthey still felt compelled to preface it with a warning: we believe that certain aspects of revivalism can bear examinationâthat the conduct of some revivalists makes a mockery of the traditional.... elmer gantry
another not-so-different world
				what is this? you could waste a lot of time trying to figure out what kind of novel the yiddish policemen's union is. some people have clearly decided. the science fiction community has claimed michael chabon's 2007 novel as one of its own, conferring on it a slew of accolades, including the prestigious.... the yiddish policeman's union
becoming more than human
				the superman concept has had a steady run in science fiction. since the genre's early days, great and mediocre writers have produced narratives around characters surpassing the natural limits constricting humanityâwith or without the disturbing nietzschean or fascist undertones. readers have long been fascinated by.... a.e. van vogt
then and now in middling america
				a century after its first publication, the story of george babbitt can elicit reactions of both "this is so dated!" and "just like today!" and often from the same readers. sinclair lewis's most influential novel, babbitt, deftly satirizes the middle-class customs, political fashions and cultural artefacts of its time and placeânamely.... babbitt
what might have happened
				a superior espionage novel can engage your sympathy with opposing characters. although at the fantasy end of the thriller spectrum one can dreamily identify with a super-heroic agent, like james bond, while cheering for the demise of a villainous mastermind out to destroy the world, the more sophisticated thriller.... eye of the needle
from russia with love and death
				after spending a good part of a summer living in and out of war and peace, i was astounded to read that in his latter years leo tolstoy disdained it. the novel, whose title has become shorthand for monumentally great literature, was elitist, the author is supposed to have said. it presented a romantic.... war and peace
in praise of running awayâand back
				john updike is most known for rabbit, run but it's not his best or best-reviewed novel. it's not even his best or best-reviewed novel in the book series it kicks off. that would be the sequel, rabbit redux, the one critics have called a masterpiece. or possibly the third or fourth book in the series, rabbit is rich and.... rabbit, run
rockin' the coming of age story
				d.h. lawrence's "the rocking-horse winner" is one of those stories frequently found in school anthologies and taught to english literature students. or at least it used to be. for educators, part of the story's classroom appeal may be that it features a child in a quasi-supernatural taleâunlike lawrence's mainstream.... the rocking-horse winner
disbelief happily suspended
				the great thing about jules verne's stories of fantastic voyages is that they don't come across as fantastic. at least while we're reading, we believe we couldâif we daredâfly across the world in a balloon, fire a rocket at the moon, travel under the seas...or plumb the depths of volcanoes toward the centre of.... a journey to the centre of the earth
full-blown birth of the austen novel
				in the dichotomy suggested in the title, jane austen in her first published work comes down conclusively on the side of sense over sensibility. it's supposed to be a study of two marriageable sisters with the eldest, elinor, presenting her case for calm common sense in relationships, while the other, marianne, flaunts.... sense and sensibility
tales from the big anglo-irish house
				it's to the credit of castle rackrent that it's usually taken to be a novel. by its meagre word count, the text constitutes a novella andâshorn of its introduction, footnotes and glossaryâit is barely that. it verges on being a long story. but maria edgeworth's work reads like an old-style historical novel, perhaps the first.... castle rackrent

features of note
how works were selected
        wondering what makes this list of great literature the most accurate and most comprehensive? what makes these books the best? read editor eric's account of how the greatest literature of all time list was researched, created, revised and recreated repeatedly over more than twenty years.
        what's so great about these books?
				readers and critics can have widely diverging ideas about what makes a certain book good and another one not-so. how can we find agreement on which works are the greatest? what does "greatest" even mean? can popular genre books be compared with literary masterpieces? how is a greatest literature of all time list even possible?
        science fiction, scifi, speculative fiction or sfâwhat is it?
        the story of the continuing struggle to define this genre and distinguish it from others.  how editor eric settled on the criterion used for his greatest science fiction list.
        finding the best translations
        much of what you read in english was not written in english. does it matter? (short answer: yes.) what makes the best translation?
much ado about shakespeare

he's the greatest of courseâat least most people think so. so we have a lot of sometimes offbeat material about the bard to offer:
• william shakespeare: what was he really about?
• the controversy: did shakespeare really write those shakespearean plays?
• the histories: what shakespeare wroteâand what really happened
• what they've said: not all writers have thought shakespeare's so great
and, after all that, the plays are still the thing:
• hamlet • henry iv, part 1 • julius caesar • king lear • macbeth • othello • the merchant of venice • romeo and juliet • the tempest
