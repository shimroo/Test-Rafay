           contrary to the belief of some people, the song has absolutely nothing to do with religion, it is strictly about human rights!  it has become known as the definitive anthem of resistance for the civilian population of gaza.  in addition to the  
               
            
               original youtube video of "we will not go down"
(which is actually more of a low quality photo collage), over the past few years, close to 1,000 additional video clips of the song have been uploaded by people all over the world (although most of them have now been taken down, mostly for legal reasons). 



              michael was interviewed about the song on multiple occasions.  check out this 
viva magazine interview about "we will not go down".
               
                also, you can hear michael discussing 
the making of his song for gaza in this video interview.

 


legal notice:  


please be advised that using "we will not go down" in any unauthorized videos is a violation of copyright law, is highly discouraged and will likely result in your video being taken down.  nothing personal.  thank you for your consideration.





freedom












           single released in 2011, inspired by the world changing events that took place in the middle east and north africa.  for the first time in modern history, people in those regions stood up and demanded their human rights, causing a domino effect which affected several countries.
            
 


           what about us (song for syria)
            












            single released in 2013, two years after peaceful, popular protests began in syria.  the first line of the lyric (âtwo years and counting, a hundred thousand deadâ) is obviously outdated at this point.  this devastating situation is still far from over, over a decade later (as of this writing).
