earthlite is the world's #1 brand for massage tables and supplies
quality with the earthlite difference
we manufacture the highest quality massage equipment including, stationary and electric lift massage tables, massage chairs, massage accessories and massage therapy supplies of all kinds. we have a wide selection of products for all of your various massage therapy needs. our products and supplies combine the superb value of unparalleled performance for the massage professional, student, and at home user. all of our tables have time proven designs and engineering. we hand make all of our massage tables with love, which ensures the highest quality equipment. we have so much faith in our products that we offer a lifetime warranty on many of our products.
the earthlite brand is the #1 choice for massage therapists. all of our tables are ergonomically designed to fit various body types and heights, and offer plush foam padding to ensure the comfort of your clientele. each massage table is extremely sturdy, durable and hand-crafted with only the finest earth-friendly materials. choose from a variety of options, colors, materials, accessories and massage table packages to suit your needs.
we use only the best maple hardwood and russian birch plywood for solid, long lasting construction. earthlite uses no rain forest hardwoods' or wood from old growth forests. we depend solely upon farmed and renewable wood sources. we've yet to find a more luxurious vinyl and cushioning system than our earth-friendly, 100% pu natursoft and nature's touch vinyls.
what to look for when buying a massage table
over a period of time, more and more people are seeing the benefits of massage. this means that more tables are being utilized as well. for both massage therapists and massage lovers, massage tables are essential. providing a comfortable massage table for your client to lie on should be expected. if this is not the case, it will affect the entire massage experience. when shopping for a new or used massage table, there are several factors to consider.
first and foremost on the list of importance is the quality of the table. it should strong and stable. for this reason alone the cheapest one on the market will not do. an effective table should be well constructed so it will last for a long time no matter how much you use it or how much weight it has on it over time. so, make sure to check the weight limit of the table and ensure that it includes a good warranty. with that said, it’s known that earthlite is one of the most reliable and solid manufacturing companies in the market. earthlite has been providing massage therapists amazing quality equipment for years. its reputation is well-earned and deserved.
the difference between a stationary table and a portable table
if you are a massage therapist, the pros and cons of either portable or stationary are important to note. portable tables are flexible enough to handle and light enough to carry to any venue. the drawback is that portable massage tables tend to bend a little bit. therefore, if you want a stronger and more rigid table it’s best to choose a stationary table since they are not prone to flexing. why is that? standard stationary massage tables have higher weight capacities that are normally double the limit of portable models.
keep in mind, there is upkeep and maintenance of either type. with portable tables that will be situated in busy massage centers, regular maintenance is required to ensure proper safety standards are met. in the long run, make sure when choosing between a stationary table or a portable table that you understand what your primary use will be. below goes into more detail on how to decide between a stationary massage table and a portable massage table.
how to decide: stationary table or portable table
after knowing the difference of stationary to portable, you need to decide which one is ideal for your situation. for those who are new in massage industry, the bullet points below will point out the pros and cons of each.

portable massage tables:
pros

cheaper initial investment
since it is portable, you can take it anywhere you have a client
remarkably sturdy consider the portable nature of the table
convenient
lightweight
flexible

cons

lower weight capacity
harder to give deep tissue massages the table tends to "flex"

stationary massage tables:
pros

more stable than portable massage tables
stronger with higher weight capacities
provide a spa-like image

cons

not portable and harder to move
more of an initial investment


when choosing any of our quality earthlite products, know that our goal is to provide tables that are of the highest quality and excellence and to project professionalism at all times. regardless of the table you choose, know that we here at earthlite believe in our products and want only to provide the best massage equipment available.
