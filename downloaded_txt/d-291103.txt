great food and great service! my husband and i went on a busy saturday night and the restaurant was completely packed! unfortunately, they didn’t have any available tables, but they said us at the bar! and the service was still a 10 out of 10 ! the servers were punctual and very friendly!

fantastic steakhouse located right off st. charles. i went with my fiancé for my birthday and we were treated very nicely from the moment we walked in. our servers jimmie and server assistant amie were outstanding. the food was on a whole other level!! the steak was prepared perfectly and was so tender. the apps were a very good portion and so flavorful. a little on the pricier side but so worth it. we will definitely be back again :)
