who's 
        that girl?
bangkok-based 
        independent writer jennifer gampell began a literary career in thailand 
        in 1993 after failing abysmally at selling balinese jewelry in paris and 
        teaching english to recalcitrant japanese schoolchildren in bangkok. why 
        thailand? that's where she crashed a motorcycle and spent an epiphanous 
        month in the orthopedic ward of a small chiang rai hospital in early 1991. 
        a month immobilized in traction was nothing compared to 15 years chained 
        to a desk at the university of california, san francisco. (click 
        here to read her asian wall street journal article 
        about this life- and career-changing accident.)
 nowadays, she contributes 
        features and first-person rants on travel and contemporary culture in 
        thailand and elsewhere in the region to the new york times, destinasian, 
        far eastern economic review and international inflight magazines 
        including qantas and discovery. she 
        also writes for the international herald tribune/new york times 
        globetrotters travel blog.
