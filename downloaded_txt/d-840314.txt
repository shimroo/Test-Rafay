    pismo pulse picker
the pismo pulse picker systems is as a pulse gating system that lets single 
    pulses or group of subsequent pulses from a femtosecond or picosecond pulse 
    train pass through the system, and stops other radiation. the system is 
    perfectly suitable for most commercial femtosecond oscillators and 
    amplifiers.
the system can pick either single pulses, shoot bursts (patterns of single 
pulses) or pick group of subsequent pulses (wider square-shaped hv pulse 
modification). hv pulse duration (i.e. gate open time) is 10 ns in the default 
    pismo 8/1 model, but can be customized from 3 to 1250 ns upon request or made 
variable. the frequency of the picked pulses starts with single shot to 1 khz 
for the basic model, and goes up to 100 khz for the most advanced one. 
    the pockels cell is supplied with a control unit that is capable of synching 
    to the optical pulse train via a built-in photodetector unit, while electric 
    trigger signal is also accepted. two additional delay channels are available 
    for synching of other equipment to the pulse picker operation. moreover, usb 
    connectivity and labview-compatible drivers save a great deal of your time 
    on storing and recalling presets, and setting up some automated experimental 
    setups. one control unit is capable of driving of up to 3 pockels cells, and 
    this comes handy in complex setups or contrast-improving schemes. the system 
    can also be modified to supply two hv pulses to one pockels cell unit, 
    making it a 2-channel pulse picker system. this may be essential for 
    injection/ejection purposes when building a regenerative or multipass 
amplifier system.

aotf infrared spectrometer
del mar photonics offer a handheld 
infrared spectrometer based on the 
acousto-optic tunable filter (aotf). this instrument is about the size and 
weight of a video camera, and can be battery operated. this unique, patented 
device is all solid-state with no moving parts. it has been sold for a wide 
variety of applications such as liquid fuel analysis, pharmaceutical analysis, 
gas monitoring and 
plastic analysis. 
miniature aotf infrared spectrometer  uses 
a crystal of tellurium dioxide to scan the wavelength.  light from a light source enters 
the crystal, and is diffracted into specific wavelengths. these wavelengths are 
determined by the frequency of the electrical input to the crystal. since there 
are no moving parts, the wavelength scanning can be extremely fast. in addition, 
specific wavelengths can be chosen by software according to the required algorithm, and therefore can be modified without changing the 
hardware. after the infrared radiation reflects off of the sample, it is 
converted into an electrical signal by the detector and analyzed by the 
computer. del mar photonics is looking for international distributors for

raven - aotf ir spectrometer for plastic identification and for variety of 
scientific and industrial collaborations to explore futher commercial potential 
of aotf technology.

hatteras-d 

    femtosecond  transient absorption data acquisition system
future nanostructures and biological nanosystems will take 
    advantage not only of the small dimensions of the objects but of the 
    specific way of interaction between nano-objects. the interactions 
    of building blocks within these nanosystems will be studied and optimized on 
    the 
    femtosecond time scale - says sergey egorov, president and ceo of del mar 
    photonics, inc. thus we put a lot of our efforts and resources into the 
    development of new ultrafast 
    dynamics tools such as our femtosecond transient absorption measurements 
    system hatteras. whether you want to 
    create a new photovoltaic system that will efficiently convert photon energy 
    in charge separation, or build a molecular complex that will dump photon energy 
    into local heat to kill cancer cells, or create a new fluorescent probe for 
    fret microscopy, understanding of internal dynamics on femtosecond time scale 
    is utterly important and requires advanced measurement techniques.reserve a

is determined by a temporal width of femtosecond optical gate pulse and doesn't 
depend on the detector response function. sum frequency generation (also called 
upconversion) in nonlinear optical crystal is used as a gating method in the

frequency-stabilized cw 
single-frequency ring dye laser dye-sf-007 pumped by dpss dmplh laser installed 
in the brand new group of dr. dajun wang at the the chinese university of hong 
kong.
dye-sf-077 features exceptionally narrow generation line width, which 
amounts to less than 100 khz. dye-sf-077 sets new standard for generation 
line width of commercial lasers. prior to this model, the narrowest line-width 
of commercial dye lasers was as broad as 500 khz - 1 mhz. it is necessary to 
note that the 100-khz line-width is achieved in dye-sf-077 without the use of an 
acousto-optical modulator, which, as a rule, complicates the design and 
introduces additional losses. a specially designed ultra-fast pzt is used for 
efficient suppression of radiation frequency fluctuations in a broad frequency 
range. dye-sf-077 will be used in resaerch of ultracold polar molecules, 
bose-einstein condensate and quantum degenerate fermi gas and high resolution 
spectroscopy
