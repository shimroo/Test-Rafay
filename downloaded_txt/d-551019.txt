message from our executive secretary-treasurer…
on december 5, 2022, liz ortega was sworn in to represent california’s 20th assembly district. we all know liz is a fighter. she spent years fighting shoulder to shoulder with all of us. liz’s victory is a victory for all of us. congratulations to each of you who played a part in our victory. most of all congratulations to liz who sacrificed, dealt with personal attacks, and fought hard for this win.
as your executive secretary treasurer, i am committed to continuing the legacy liz left behind. we are powerful when we are united. our power is evident in our numerous victories from the general election.
the new year 2023 will bring us many opportunities as our newly and re-elected allies take office.
i look forward to working with all of you as we continue our fight for workers and working families.
i am humbled and honored to lead this council.
in solidarity,











keith d. brown
executive secretary-treasurer
