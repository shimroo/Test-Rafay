about chronic pain

chronic pain










  










chronic pain is a persistent pain that adversely affects your well-being, level of function, and quality of life. it can be the result of an injury or infection, or there may be an ongoing cause of pain.



definition
 chronic pain is ongoing or recurrent pain lasting longer than the time of normal healing for an illness or injury, or more than 3 to 6 months.1




causes
chronic pain can result from an injury; surgery that may have caused nerve damage; spinal conditions such as degenerative disc disease; damage to nerves after an infection; or other causes.




symptoms
symptoms of chronic pain can range from mildly uncomfortable to completely disabling. you may feel a sharp or stabbing pain, a burning sensation, or a dull muscular ache. affected areas may feel tender or sore to the touch and the pain may increase with movement. often chronic pain is not static. it can change and intensify as you move throughout the day.




diagnosis
you may have chronic pain if your pain has lasted more than 6 months. talk to your doctor for more information.
