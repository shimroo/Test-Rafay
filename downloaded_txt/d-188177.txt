tim & jenn's tale of sir robin




tim & jenn's tribute to sir robin of camelot,
also known as "sir robin the - not - quite - so - brave - as - sir lancelot,  who had nearly fought the dragon of angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious chicken of bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the battle of badon hill!"  after a series of misadventures, brave sir robin met his untimely end at the bridge of death, when he failed to answer the bridgekeeper's  third question, and so was hurled into the gorge of eternal peril (you see why it's so important to study hard in school, kids!).   and so we recount herein the exploits of one of the great unsung (er, little sung) heroes of the round table.
