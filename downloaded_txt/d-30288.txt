register your business online




legally register your business.  1. what do i need? most businesses need at least a business license and an ein. if using a business name, you must register it with a dba, llc or corporation. buying or selling wholesale, or selling retail, requires a seller's permit. 2. how much? all 
									fees are included in prices: $39 plus government fee, if any.3. what will you do?  we will check for business name availability, and file your legal licensing documents as required by law. then we publish your licenses in a legal newspaper, where required by law. we will file, obtain, and mail and or email the licenses to you.6. how long?  normally, filings take 3-5 business days, but you can expedite it at check out. 







do i need a business  license or  permit?




all businesses legally need some type of license or permit. for example:all businesses need a business license just because they are "businesses". all businesses that sell, lease, or sell or buy wholesale, any items or services that are subject to sales tax, need to obtain a seller's permit. 







should i get an  llc, or corp?




all businesses are required to select a legal entity company structure because all licenses will be registered under that structure: 
llc, 
									corp, 
									partnership, 
									sole propr.








                                        what is a legal entity or company structure?




entity company structures must be selected because that is how the government taxes you: namely, you are taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, llc and each one has advantages or disadvantages when taxed.
1. sole owners can be a sole proprietorship, an llc or corporation.

2. partners can be a partnership, an llc or corporation.

3. a sole owner can be an llc, or corporation because he or she can be the corp. or llc director, and the three officers: president, treasurer, and secretary.








                                        i will hire employees within 30 days (or i have employees). do i need to register as an employer?





                                       yes, if you are or will soon be an employer, you need employer identification numbers:  1. a 
									   federal employer id (ein) and a 
									   state employer id (sein).
