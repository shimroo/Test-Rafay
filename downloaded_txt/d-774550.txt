maximizing your savings: how to find and use free coupons
june 18, 2024june 20, 2024
 

 

in today’s economy, maximizing your savings is essential. one of the most effective ways to do this is by utilizing free coupons. coupons can significantly reduce your grocery bills, lower the cost of household items, and even provide discounts on dining and entertainment.
find free coupons
online coupon websites
websites like coupons.com, retailmenot, and honey offer a wide array of coupons for various products and services. these sites are updated regularly, providing the latest deals from both online and brick-and-mortar stores.
manufacturer websites
many manufacturers offer coupons directly on their websites. brands like procter & gamble, unilever, and general mills often provide printable coupons for their products. signing up for their newsletters can also give you access to exclusive discounts.
store websites and apps

retailers like target, walmart, and kroger have their apps and websites that feature digital coupons. by signing up for their loyalty programs, you can receive personalized coupons based on your shopping habits.
coupon apps
apps like ibotta, rakuten, and shopkick offer cashback and coupons for purchases made through their platforms. these apps are easy to use and can be a great way to earn extra savings on everyday purchases.
social media
following your favourite brands on social media platforms like facebook, twitter, and instagram can also lead to coupon discoveries. companies frequently post exclusive discounts and promotions for their followers.
use coupons effectively
plan your shopping trips
before heading to the store, plan your shopping list around the coupons you have. this ensures you’re buying items that can be discounted. combine this with weekly store sales for even more significant savings
organize your coupons
keep your coupons organized by category or expiration date. this can be done using a coupon binder, accordion file, or even a mobile app designed for coupon organization.
stack coupons
many stores allow you to use multiple coupons on a single item, a practice known as stacking. for example, you can combine a manufacturer coupon with a store coupon for the same product, maximizing your discount.
use loyalty programs

sign up for store loyalty programs, which often provide additional coupons and discounts. some programs offer points for every dollar spent, which can be redeemed for future purchases.
be aware of coupon policies
each store has its coupon policy. familiarize yourself with these policies to avoid any issues at checkout. some stores have limits on the number of identical coupons you can use, while others may not accept printed coupons from the internet.
maximizing savings
double coupons
some stores offer double coupon days, during which the value of your coupons is doubled. look for these promotions to maximize your savings.
shop during sales

combine coupons with store sales for maximum savings. buy one, get one free (bogo) offers are particularly advantageous when paired with coupons.
stock up on non-perishables
when you find a great deal on non-perishable items, stock up. this ensures you’re saving money over the long term on items you’ll use regularly.
be strategic
use high-value coupons in the smallest size allowed by the coupon. this can sometimes lead to getting products for free or at a meagre cost.
