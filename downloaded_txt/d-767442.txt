"everything from the appetizers to the main dishes and sweet bottle of wine were nothing short of excellence. we were both very pleased with our cooked filet mignon and salmon dishes. each served with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes. coming out, we immediately agreed this place will be our annual tradition, celebrating us and everyone in our lives."

"my boyfriend and went to the cellar for my 40th birthday and it was an amazing experience.  our waiter was amazing and very knowledgeable about history of the restaurant and the menu.  my boyfriend said his steak was the best he have ever had.  it was cooked to perfection and the herb butter they put on top was an added bonus.  the cocktails were also great.  the mixologist knows his stuff.   and they gave us the best crème brûlée on the house because it was my birthday."

"the food here was exquisite. i had the classic chateaubriand for two with my fiancé. our steak was medium rare and it was by far one of the most tender pieces of meat i've had in my life. out waitress was very knowledgeable on both the menu and the restaurant itself. we also had some tiki drinks that were delicious. i cannot wait to come back for my birthday! once the food arrived, it became such a spiritual moment between my food and i that i forgot to take a picture. it was just that delicious!"

"an undeniably amazing experience! the cellar restaurant is located in the historic villa del sol, and our entire party of 20 people all raved about their dining experience. even finding the restaurant was a topic of discussion, which is located in the basement of an older californian hotel, which has now been designed by gene white, the craftsman from the 'pirates of the caribbean' at disneyland. the food was all spectacular, and we all had such a great time. first class service, and an experience i will remember for a long time!"
