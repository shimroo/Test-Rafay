it‚Äôs been a busy, busy month of stitching for me. i‚Äôve been participating in semi sane stitcher‚Äôs snowball party game on facebook, along with the group‚Äôs ‚Äúchoose my wip‚Äù challenge, where the other participants choose which piece of your offerings needs 500 stitches that week. i‚Äôve completed two of those weeks, bombed the third, and [‚Ä¶]

i‚Äôll be challenging myself with my fairly large to-be-read pile in my house to fit books to various challenges this year. i may not complete them all, or i may extend them beyond 2025 just because, but i‚Äôll give them my best shot. üôÇ these are the ones that looked particularly interesting to me. i [‚Ä¶]

one of my goals in 2024 was to read more. i‚Äôd fallen completely out of reading during covid due to all of the chaos ‚Äì trying to work full-time remote while also training multiple people remotely to do my job (which changes in both scope and workflow nearly monthly), helping my son as a first-grader [‚Ä¶]

current wips note: must have been started prior to 2025. bolded means i have worked on them in 2025. legacy/ufo projects note: these are projects, either started before 2013 or that i‚Äôve adopted from others but have not yet stitched on personally, that are in a holding pattern ‚Äì especially because i have too many [‚Ä¶]

hi everyone! the season is definitely heading toward winter, and i am so ready for cozy nights under my electric blanket on the couch with either stitching or a good book in my hand! i‚Äôve been doing some initial stitching plans for 2025, trying to resist all of the sals (omg, so many!), and prepare [‚Ä¶]

hi, i'm measi




(a/k/a melissa)
i'm turning 50 in 2025, and exploring this new decade of my life with a refocus on blogging about my life - marriage, parenthood, being owned by cats, paganism, cross stitching, journaling, books, and letter writing... and probably some other stuff along the way.  nothing monetized here - just old-fashioned personal blogging.
