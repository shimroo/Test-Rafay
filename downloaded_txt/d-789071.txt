  welcome to the 
 
world clarinet alliance 
official site.     as you have noticed by the many resource 
and news pages, this has become a vital primary source of information for all 
levels of players and interests, and is intended to expand horizons and make 
possible vital advancements for all players, students and professionals alike, 
and give a truly international perspective on the community of clarinet 
performance and education. 

               
wka is interactive with many music organizations, military band organizations, 
industry, festivals worldwide, international competitions, master classes, and 
the academic sector. 
 
               
as the membership is free for everyone to join, this opens the open-source 
communication opportunities to connect with other like-minded players and 
friends.   because of internet speed of current communication, anyone, 
from remote areas or across the overseas areas, can be actively involved in the 
clarinet community worldwide.   no magazine is published as everything 
is downloadable, and one can print targeted information and create their own 
'magazine', free from advertising, but substance information that can be used.  
it is highly important for all teachers and clarinet organizations to make wka 
known to their students and members. the purpose of wka is to serve the entire 
music and clarinet community.
 
              
wka is available to everyone to communicate and inquire, and information to be 
shared with members is welcomed and encouraged.
