our colorful cover photo. . . 
            the high-flying young man on the swedish built husqvarna is
            malcolm smith. he was caught mid-air , photographically, by
            larry willett. the fine shot was taken at the recent
            corriganville (calif.) scrambles.

            ed note - check out the goggles pulled down, no gloves,
            husky hivis vest, 10 cylinder fins indicating a 360cc, skid
            plate, steel rims, kick stand, and looks like an early bell
            helmet.

            were those the days or what?

2010
              brand new husqvarna book! 

special thanks to gunnar
              lindstrom for writing this important book,  husqvarna
              success.  gunnar is known as the foremost expert on
              husqvarna, and for good reason. there isnt enough room in
              this article, nor the entire website,to fully chronicle
              the 107-year history of husqvarna motorcycles. such a task
              would require a complete book. fortunately, thats exactly
              what husky fans can expect this summer, juli 2010. 

              gunnar has coordinated a four-person effort to document
              the company he worked for so many years ago. his attention
              to detail, personal insider knowledge and a lifetime of
              connections ensure that it will surpass the small number
              of existing publications and become the defining literary
              work for all things husky. 
              ten years in the making, husqvarna success, has
              been released by parker house publishing this july,
              2010.   isbn-13:978-1-935350-14-9

              thank you gunnar, tosh, torsten and malcolm for making all
              us feel like champions in the wonderful world of off road
              riding with husqvarna.

              find this new  book at gt motors 517-485-6815

1972 400 cr bengt åberg replica
husqvarna dominated all off
          road events during 1972...motocross, desert, enduro, and
          special events like baja and the mint 400 as well as world
          class motocross. world class riders torlief hansen, bengt
          åberg, arne kring, gunnar lindstrom were heros on
          huskys.   have some spare money ready, you'll want a
          husky!this mj 400 pictured above has original high cross bar
          bars, yellow number plates to signify open class, and alloy
          fenders. this is the "new generation" husqvarna that was
          designed with a new heavy duty transmission with 5 speeds and
          left hand shift. this was the first model year with this
          feature of left hand shift. this photo is actually an mj
          publicity foto  taken for cycle world. interesting to
          note the cable routing of the front brake cable .... in front
          of the number plate. this was to assure it did not "hook" the
          front forks and lock up the front brake. the polished akronts,
          polished fenders, chrome tank panels, new shiney spokes, along
          with fork tubes and handle bars make a "knock out" look for a
          competition bike. pulling up on the start line amongst any
          other brands of the day was quite intimidating. all things
          being equal, not only did everyone know that you most likely
          were going to holeshot, but you were looking better than all
          while doing it. a new 72 husqvarna 400 sold for $1200. a new
          suzuki tm400 sold for $950. it was mind boggling at the time
          why anyone would have purchased anything but a husky!


1984 husqvarna 510 te 
the 1984 husqvarna 510 te was
        a bold and world class step for husqvarna motorcycles. the 510
        was introduced mid year 83 and the 84's were a similiar model.
        twin shock on the husky "o" series frame, these 4 strokes were
        the lightest and most competitive 4 strokes in the world and in
        an era that  was dominated by 2 strokes. the engine was
        kept light with a reed activated oiling system. the "te" model
        shown was the the enduro with full lighting, horn, speedo, but
        don't be fooled , this is a full out competittion model. twin
        exhaust was very impressive, as was the plastic tank and new
        style graphics.
the 84 510 te has a 6 speed
          tramnsmission. the camshaft rides in ball bearings, and the
          big end has silver plated cage. the carurettor, dellorto 36mm
          has an accelerator pump for smooth response. the electrical
          system (sem) on this model puts out 140watts of power. the
          front brake is a double leading shoe. the engine has an
          automatic as well as a manual decompression release.

the rear suspension was
          husqvarna itc. the small horn was bolted to the front tank
          mount and is visable in the photo. the speedometer cable runs
          up the right fork leg and has a wire bracket guide also
          visable in photo. 
usa isde riders wally
          wilson, terry cunningham, scot harden, mark hyde, ed lojak,
          mike melton, and dick burleson were just some of the heros
          that were husqvarna team riders in this era. 





1989
125


























        wrk and 250 wrk 
husqvarna wrk 125 was the 1988
        best selling bike and was improved even futher with marzocchi
        forks, new tank and radiator shrouds. the motor is the high
        horsepower mx version with enduro gearbox and ignition. the 125
        is pictured at the top. 
husqvarna wrk 250 was also
        offered in europe as a 240 or a 260. white power provides the
        suspension. the engine is powervalved, liquid cooled, 2 stroke,
        6 speed with plenty of power. excel rims were standard
        equipment, but the pirelli tires as pictured may have been
        changed for usa sales. 

1998
          husqvarna te 610 
this te 610  is a high
        tech , liquid cooled four stroke with a four valve head and
        overhead cam. this bike comes with 45mm marzocchi forks and a
        progressive linked showa monoshock. the tires are metzler
        "unicross", chain is did and the brakes are brembo. the
        husqvarna engineers are still producing the best looking and
        worldclass competitive motorcycle. the spark plug is a ngk
        c7e,  gearbox holds 1600 cc's,  dell'orto phm 40 ds
        carburator is used,  and the displacement is 577 cc's. this
        husky has a six speed gearbox and uses did 520 chain.

like the te model above, the
        lights make this competition model legal for enduro events, but
        were not intended to make this model legal for street use. the
        kick stand folds way up out of harms way and is visable tucked
        under the left number plate. great handling, hi reliability when
        maintained properly , excellent torque thru out the full rpm
        rangemake this model a great modern competition or trail riding
        bike.

thanks again to club member
          kevin grimes for mikkola decal for '71-'74 250cr's and wr's. i
          don't find this decal very often as i locate 250's of this
          era. the husqvarna factory did apply some of these decals to
          the air cleaner covers, and they did supply the decals to the
          dealers, but some bikes were missed. anybody have a better
          recollection than mine? you will notice that the two decals
          have a different color yellow/gold fill and the ribbons and
          other details are different. 
happy
          huskys

i also have additional
            hobby pages i work on.

          gopher description:
my name is craig comontofski
        and my wife and i live in martinsburg,west virginia, a small
        town in the very easternmost part of the state and a very
        historical location from a civil war viewpoint. my large scale
        interests are motorcycle and automobile restoration , but can
        extend to major home improvements as well.
my first husky was a '66
          model 250 i bought from dub smith in '69. i rode the '71
          elsinore gran prix after following ignition and suspension
          upgrade suggestions on the '66 from malcolm smith who was the
          local husky dealer in riverside. i placed 23rd out of about
          900 -- i thought i was pretty hot stuff . bought a new mi 250
          in mid-'71. raced my brains out at spillway, baymare, indian
          dunes, coalinga, laguna seca, etc . bought a new husky each
          year in '72, '73. i was a cal poly penguin mc member and was
          fortunate enough to able to have free range in the las padres
          natl forest. quit racing motocross in '74 and put the '73 400
          away. moved back to sports cars, antique cars,
          restoration........came foward to huskys in '92 with a renewed
          desire. joined ahrma, ama, and proceeded to scour the country
          for old huskys to restore for show, race and collecting. i
          lucked out with good project material coming from all over the
          country. my expertise due to "hands on experience" is 55-84
          motocross. old bike journal features my 250t commando in april
          '97. old bike journal is no longer in print, but you can still
          find great husqvarna articles in the husqvarna club
          newsletter.
