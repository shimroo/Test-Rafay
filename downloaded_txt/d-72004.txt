i am never disappointed with my purchases from paper direct.
i used these certificates to make awards for people who go above and beyond for their community. i love the color, it's not bright. the border is beautiful and attractive but a little wider than i would like. i was able to adjust the words to fit perfectly. i am never disappointed with my purchases from paper direct. the variety of products for programs, invitations, and certificate is just amazing.
- dawn
