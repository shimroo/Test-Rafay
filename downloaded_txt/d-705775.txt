strict training tips





with my main race the rocky raccoon 50-miler in february, i'm tightening up my training to make sure i complete my goal to finish! i'm not so concerned about my time, i just want to be out there with these wonderful ultra runners (they were so helpful last year), and feel that incredible feeling of the finish line! here's my current training to get me to my next marathon--west palm beach--but it will just be a training run.so here's the plan for now:no walking in my training, my walking is down pat--it's all about running now.run 5 days a week.one day of speed training.one day of tempo training.pilates class followed by a recovery run.long run---half of it done at marathon pace.two gels per hour of training--one water bottle per 45 minutes.recovery run followed by strength training.low-fat chocolate milk within 20-30 minutes of workouts lasting over 1 1/2 hrs.tighten up my eating--strict vegetarian diet (i can't believe how much this helps!!).good form while running--good posture throughout the day.respect the warm up and cool down.increase water throughout the day (know where all the toilets are in my neighborhood!!).i must say that i am shocked how my body responds to this. i guess i still can't fully believe i can change my body at my age, but i can! so all you youngsters out there that are dragging your feet with your training...if i can do it, so can you!!!!have a yummy thanksgiving, with lots of loved ones surrounding you all!i am grateful for my health, loving friends, good kids and any day the sun comes out in chicago during the winter! life is good.
