new publication links added regularlywelcome to the acjrca
we are a dynamic mix of public servants, practitioners, evaluators, analysts, students, and academics united by a common interest in criminal justice issues. we seek to stimulate discussion of current criminal justice issues through two conferences each year, newsletters, and a new social media exchange. please explore our website to find out more about our conferences, other information exchanges, our association, and the benefits of membership!
peer networking survey
california has a rich ecosystem of agencies, organizations, and associations in the fields of criminal justice, corrections, rehabilitation, victims’ needs, and community services. acjrca wants to expand information sharing in this system and is asking you to help by adding to our peer organizations survey. look for your groups – if they’re not yet in the survey, fill in whatever information, even if it is just an organization name. if someone else has already entered your group, look to see if you can fill in any of the blanks. we plan to build an online “switchboard” to help groups find each other, communicate, build networks, publicize events, and work together on our common mission of public safety, healthy communities, and justice.
