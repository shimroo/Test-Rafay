academics done differently.
academics 
dive into world-class programs
imagine programs that ignite your passion, run by faculty at the top of their fields. programs that get you out of the classroom — and experiencing the world. imagine having state-of-the-art facilities and technology at your fingertips.
here, there’s no need to imagine.

100%

16:1
our student-to-teacher ratio fosters close professor relationships.







 




























 
















hands on. minds on.
hands on. minds on.

hop aboard a dolphin research vessel. stage plays. or, preserve history in the nation's oldest city. just be sure to keep your muck boots handy, because the learning here is always hands-on and knee-deep. 
whether it's practicing spanish on a galleon,  excavating shipwrecks, or finding your way around the alligator farm, the only thing you won't find here are typical, dull lectures. (and yes, we literally mean a farm with real alligators.) 
this college is for people who want to go where others haven't and do what has yet to be done.
