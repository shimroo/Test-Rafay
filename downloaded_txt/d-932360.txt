	 good riddance australia....
	 
    



      as many people have known....i have decided to seek greener pastures back in singapore instead of here in boring brisbane... i have actually thought of many reasons to hate australia....but i cant seem to write any 1 of them...maybe next time...anyway sorry for the late posts, as i dun have the motivation to write currently...i also have many pics i wanted to upload here including graduation pics and my sydney trip, but i think i should wait till im back in sg...meanwhile i guess its back to daily mahjong sessions and looking for jobs time....p.s. mamaruth: i finally update my blog ler...wahhahaha

	 chi bi part i
	 
    



      yesterday, me, qk and two of his friends went to watch the epic movie chi bi (or red cliffs if you dunno...) which is a significant battle in the novel romance of the three kingdoms...the movie turned out to be quite well done, especially the mini battle involving the use of the ba gua formation, however what i do not like about this is that the movie ends without showing the start of the real battle...and the performance of the stupid lin chi ling who is acting as zhou yu's wife xiao qiao...anyway here is a poster of takeshi kaneshiro who is acting as zhuge liang in the movie....

	 eating fest
	 
    



      last thursday, the uq idiots treated me to geylang lor 9 beef hor fun since they didn come for the buffet..although i find it to be quite good, they said the standard has dropped from last time...guess this may be due to inflation rates...lol.. after that i was hoping to find somewhere to play pool but the best one is still in marine parade and they do not want to take a cab there...in the end we went to bugis and try some dessert...duh...anyway here are some pics of the hor fun meeting...beef hor funselwin eating beef hor fun...he said this is to show ruth...lol...the super lousy oyster omelette...

	 extending my passport
	 
    



      this afternoon i went with mum all the way from my house to the immigrations and checkpoint authority (ica) at lavender to extend my passport....turns out that the chow auntie dun wanna extend my passport as it is only issued for 10 years....!@#$%^&*()..this means i have to apply for a new biometric passport...and this also mean i have to memorise a new passport number....as if my brain can hold another 7 digit number....if this goes on, sooner or later there will be amyloid beta in my brain...which would lead to formation of plaques and ultimately alzheimers...not only that...i have to travel there again next wk to collect my biometric passport...sianz....total journey:tampines to lavendar -> 30minica-> 5min!!!!lavender to tampines -> 30minmoral of the story: travelling by mrt in singapore sux...!!!
