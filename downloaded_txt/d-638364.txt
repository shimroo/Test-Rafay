"home of well rounded top quality akc golden retrievers"  welcome to my websitethis is where i get to share some of the joy i receive from being involved in the sport of pure bred dogs.in 2001 i became involved in the conformation ring.at that time, i felt the need for a show nameso i decided on"omni""omni" definition - (all : in all ways, places, etc. : without limits) seems to fit the goals i have perfectly.i strive to have goldens that are not only show dogs, but that are members of my family first!dogs that can run and play with all their heart or sit and relax quietly next to me.goldens that are able to retrieve a bird in the field, assist a disabled person, lead a blind personor run an agility course.goldens that can compete in the comformation ringor work in an obedience ring.my goal is to have dogs that can do any of this but be healthy and beautiful family members first!!yes, this takes a lot of time, money and dedication,but this is my passion and i love doing itbecause i love my dogs!!please look around my website.i hope you will experience some of the joy i getfrom having goldens in my life!
