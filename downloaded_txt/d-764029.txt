since it was founded over half a century ago, witter towbars has consistently set the standard for
                quality, reliability and value for money. witter towbars are designed, developed and tested to regulation 55 at our centre of engineering excellence in the uk. our fully qualified engineers utilise the latest 3d cad systems to design towbars that fit all the vehicle manufacturers' specified attachment points, ensuring the widest variety of towbars possible. once designed, our towbars go through vigorous testing carried out in our in house servo hydraulic test rigs. the testing process is independently witnessed and authorised by the uk vehicle certification agency (vca). only when the vca are satisfied that we have met all of the criteria of the ec regulations, will they then grant us ec type approval for that particular towbar. therefore we can give every witter towbar our life time guarantee.
