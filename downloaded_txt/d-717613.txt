hillside church: a home for families, skeptics & our community
as part of our calling to "make disciples," we desire to work for the good of our local communities. hillside does this through acts of service, care for the poor and marginalized, and support of community needs. we believe this goal is rooted in our gratitude for jesus' work in our lives through the gospel. we hope you will also come to experience the love and freedom of jesus. that's why our church is a home for families, skeptics, and our community. we have received a great gift, and we want to share it!
