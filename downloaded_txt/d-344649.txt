us 20 bridge replacement

palmer engineering prepared plans for the replacement of the 1930s vintage, 27-span continuous concrete slab bridge that carries us 20 over two lines of norfolk southern railroad tracks. the crossing was complicated by a high degree of skew between the railroad lines and the highway, as well as the need for the new bridge to span two additional railroad lines that may be added in the future.
