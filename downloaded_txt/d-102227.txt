am having a difficult time creating graceful naked or dead trees. the
more trees i attempt the worse they look. how can i master simple
trees?







answer: this
problem is solved with practice. of course you must use the correct
brush (#4 script liner brush), the right amount of paint and water
(inky substance), and with a light touch you can create beautiful
trees. remember, always start from the bottom, go up from the trunk
of the tree, then go out to attach branches and always retrace your
steps.great news! we are now offering our videos on dvd or as a digital download (no shipping charge for download videos).if you purchase the digital download you will be emailed a link to download your video (your download link will be emailed to you within 12 hours - but it usually only takes an hour or two, depending on the time of day your order is received). please be sure your email address is correct when filling in your checkout information!click here for more information about our digital downloadswords cannot express how saddened we are by the loss of jerry yarnell. our deepest condolences to jerry's family. jerry yarnell will be greatly missed!
