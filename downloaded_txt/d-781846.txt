against the stream            meditation center is an american buddhist lineage founded by noah levine 

   











the teachings of the buddha are radical
and counter instinctual, by going against the norm of clinging, aversion and self-centeredness one finds the freedom and happiness we have always been seeking.

going against the stream
the buddha described the path that leads to freedom as the liberation of the heart, which is love. the buddha implied that this path of love goes against the stream. it is a revolutionary act to overcome the forces of greed, hatred, and delusion through the cultivation of their opposites: generosity, compassion, and understanding.
