park west has long been one of chicago’s premier concert venues. built in 1916 as a home for movies and vaudeville, the building’s rare diamond-shaped interior gave it a distinction unlike any other theatre in the city. it instantly became an anchor for entertainment in the vibrant lincoln park neighborhood and found lasting prosperity when it was transformed into a live concert hall in the late 1970s. since then, its calendar has been filled with performances featuring some of the biggest names in contemporary music, many of whom have gone on to play in arenas and stadiums. park west is also one of chicago’s best-equipped multimedia facilities with a sterling reputation for corporate meetings and special events.
