      how cwc is returning wolves to the wild
    

      california wolf center is creating a sustainable future in which wolves and people share a healthy ecosystem. 

through captive breeding, wild release, and public education, we work to ensure that wolves, livestock, and people can peacefully thrive in today's world. 

the california wolf center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and thanks to our incredible volunteers who help keep our costs down, over 90% of every dollar you donate goes directly toward supporting our mission.
