convenient




cite partner programs take place on weekends and school holidays, so you don’t have to slog through hours of coursework after working a whole day. we’ve designed these courses to work for you. and during your program, we work with you to ensure you get exactly what you need to succeed.





        how can we help   





affordable




cite courses are affordably priced — often far below other programs. not only that, we are upfront about all fees. you’ll never be surprised by an additional fee, and your tuition is locked in for the entirety of your program. we also offer financial aid through our partner colleges.





        ask us about pricing   





practical




during your coursework, you will build real-world skills and meet the people you need to further your career. we host student and alumni events so that you can network with our strong community of professionals. 25% of principals in nyc are cite partner program grads, and we are in nearly every district office. our alumni coordinator ensures you get the chance to take advantage of this large and diverse pool of resources.
