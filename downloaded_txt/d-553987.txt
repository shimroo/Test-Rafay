it’s all about quality.
we believe that a quality building becomes so much more than just a building. it becomes a place where classic cars are collected, where the reliable tractor awaits the next snowfall, and where families gather to celebrate life’s most joyous occasions. that’s why our father, everett skinner iii, and our grandfather bill, started the barn yard in 1984. fast forward to today and our dedication to quality has driven us to a full fleet of delivery trucks, multiple full-time build crews, and a state of the art timber frame facility. because how we build it today makes all the difference tomorrow. we are excited to get started on your project.  our story »
















builders. designers. engineers.
since 1984
