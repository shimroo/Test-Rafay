what clients
                are saying






connie has been a picture of professionalism since the start of our home buying journey. we have purchased several homes over the years and could tell instantly that she has a deep knowledge of the real estate market, asks the right questions, and goes above and beyond to get answers she may not know. we had full confidence working with her while living out of state and getting to purchase and close on our new family home thanks to connie’s rapid response time and true understanding of our wants and needs for our new home. connie did a thoughtful and thorough job educating us on how to navigate some of the hurdles we came across and created a seamless experience for us to close on time. she thinks outside the box and has impeccable follow through, she does what say says she will do! i highly recommend working with connie if you are looking for a trustworthy and incredibly knowledgeable real estate professional in the bend region.

we purchased our home in bend's orchard district back in 2018 with the guidance and expertise of suzanne!
as is probably usually the case, my girlfriend and i had quite a bit of nerves going into the process, as this was our first major purchase together and her first home-buying experience.
one of the main concerns we had was selling my home to have the money to purchase a place together. suzanne put any concerns about that portion to rest right away.  she had a great idea on the price point we should list the house for that would be fair and profitable, but also in the range to keep the potential buyers coming. she nailed it!  we had interest right away and were able to sell rather quickly with multiple offers on the table. 
on top of helping sell the existing property, suzanne also worked tirelessly and patiently with us over a couple month period, every weekend looking at houses. she knew what we were looking for and was able to find the home we ended up purchasing the morning it went on the market. it was perfect and we couldn't have been more excited. even with multiple contingencies in place, it still all went so smoothly and that was thanks to not only suzanne's professionalism but also the dedication and care she has for her clients. we have referred friends to suzanne and she is still a confidant and go-to when we have any real estate-based questions. we are happy to not just call her our agent but also our friend! we love suzanne and so will you!

i want to say thanks for you and your firm's professional handling of my recent townhouse sale in bend, oregon. your firm was first class in all respects. you obtained an offer very shortly after it was listed. this offer was all cash, and escrow was closed within 20 days.

i would gladly recommend you personally and your firm for anyone looking to buy or sell in the bend area.

thank you again.

"kathy is a joy to work with, genuine, professional, thoughtful, over and above communicator and just a rare individual and great person. she's so supportive, always thinking ahead and anticipating; providing great insight into the home, neighborhoods, the builders, services, local contractors, etc. you name it, and kathy has info or she will drill in deep to get it for you. we purchased our home remotely and it would never have been so smooth without kathy as our partner in the process. i truly can't overstate what a great realtor, and great person kathy is to work with."

oleta was an outstanding agent and very enjoyable to work with. she is very knowledgeable and helped us through a very rough time in selling my dad's house after his passing. it wasn't easy as dad lived in bend, and i lived a couple of hours away. her recommendations and connections in the bend area were very instrumental in helping us get our best price. oleta came highly recommended from a friend and i'm glad we choose oleta to help us through a very difficult period.

oleta’s help was essential from beginning to end. this was the first time for me to sell a home on my own, and i was very intimidated by the process. oleta took time to walk me through each step and explained everything in a way that made me feel confident to move forward.  her guidance made all the difference. i highly recommend oleta yancey for anyone looking to buy or sell a home.

"in 2024, my partner chad and i chose to escape the texas summer heat, so we selected bend, oregon to check out. my experience with kathy was one of the best parts of my stay. it all started by our stopping at an open house in discovery west. i usually like to house snoop on my own without leaving contact information. but with kathy, i felt completely comfortable doing so as i shared up front that we were simply kicking tires. aside from real estate, kathy turned us on to interesting and unique aspects of bend and the surrounding area. we checked out her suggestions. after discussions, chad and i decided to look at real estate, and kathy spent time discussing various areas of bend which we might have interest in, based on personal choices and affordability. we explored the areas on our own, but i knew kathy was but a call away. kathy also took the time to explain how the new broker / buyer / commission arrangements were implemented in oregon after national regulation changes occurred in 2024. we toured a home that had possibilities but ultimately decided to hold off. we appreciate all bend has to offer but are not yet ready to commit. i describe kathy as someone who is real estate savvy, honest, patient, kind, genuine, and most sincere. you might say … “we just hit it off.” the acquaintance relationship has turned into a friendship. on the day before leaving the area, we met for a final social gathering. it was hard to say goodbye to my new friend. should we decide to pursue real estate in bend, i know exactly who i will call to get the ball rolling ... kathy lang!"
