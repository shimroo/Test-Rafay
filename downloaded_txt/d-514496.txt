precision engineering for optimal performance 



in comparison 











troublesome valve installations can cause “off spec” products, require constant maintenance, and restrict production time. other valve styles, some of them originally designed for liquid handling, have shortcomings, as shown below. 







 










 



roto-disc® totally open: 



material falls unobstructed through the inlet opening. nothing is in the flow stream to cause product bridging, so you get the full flow capacity of the valve. notice that the sealing surfaces are protected from direct contact with material. 







 



roto-disc® closing: 



as the valve begins to rotate closed, the dome wipes against the seat, cutting off the flow of product and pushing material above or below the valve instead of wedging it between the dome and seat. the design naturally resists abrasive wear and there are no pinch points or places for material to hang-up. 







 



roto-disc® fully closed: 



closure is clean and the valve is fully seated. the dome and seat form a positive seal that eliminates leakage across the seat. double o-rings prevent leakage through the stems. 












 




ball valve 



ball valves were developed over a century ago for liquids and gasses. they are heavy and take up a lot of headroom. more importantly they have a dead space between the casting and ball that can fill and pack with product causing abrasive wear on the seals and ball or causing cross contamination/spoilage between batches. 








 




butterfly valve 



butterfly valves have a vane in the center of the flow stream that can cause bridging and obstruct product flow. since the seat and the vane are exposed they can wear quickly, making them unable to seal. 








 




slide gate valve 



slide gate valves can pinch and/or cut product, jamming the valve so it won’t close completely. the linear motion of the valve can drag material across the seal, causing wear and allowing product to leak out thru the sliding seal.
