									humanity’s quest for answers								



											science tells us that the universe is composed of matter and energy. but how do matter and energy explain consciousness? read sant rajinder singh ji's fascinating article on our search for answers to our existence.										





 
 



									humility comes with oneness								



											when we connect with the divine power within through meditation, we reach a stage of oneness and realize we are all one and the same; this leads to true humility.

											spiritually rise in 2025												
										


january 12, 2025




today at the international science of spirituality meditation center in lisle, illinois, sant rajinder singh ji maharaj focused on the slogan for the coming year: spiritually rise in 2025! to rise spiritually, he explained, is to transcend physical body consciousness, moving beyond the limitations of our physical senses to experience more than what meets the eye. it is to experience that which is of the spirit, ethereal and more conscious than this physical world.
rising spiritually is an experience available to every soul born in the human form.  each of us can rise spiritually. it is simply a matter of where we focus our attention and efforts. the divine power of god lies latent within us, and we can access it through meditation. as we withdraw our sensory currents from the outer world and gather them at the third eye, a world of joy, beauty, love, peace, and tranquility opens up for us. the more we experience this inner world, the more it draws us in and the more we long to partake of it.
gradually, as we rise spiritually, a profound transformation occurs within us: we begin to embody the divine attributes of the creator, becoming calmer, more peaceful, happier, more caring and resilient, unperturbed by the turmoil of the outer world. the journey within is a journey of love, said the spiritual master. it’s a journey driven by an intense desire and longing to know god. the nearer we get to our goal, the stronger the yearning becomes and the more earnest and determined our efforts. much like a runner in a 100-meter race accelerates as they approach the finish line, our yearning, too, is intensified when our goal is in sight.





 



								 
							


 




												
											living in the light during challenging times												
										


december 1, 2024




in his first spiritual discourse in lisle, illinois, after his global world tour, sant rajinder singh ji maharaj reflected on the ups and downs that are part of our time here on earth. in the past few years, a global pandemic, a challenging financial environment, and political instability in regions around the world have wreaked havoc for many. challenges and difficulties can often linger on, painting a rather grim picture of life. against such a backdrop, how can we hope to lead calm and peaceful lives? how can we deal with situations that seem to be beyond our control and still find happiness?
the key, said the spiritual master, is to change how we respond to our environment, make the necessary adjustments to adapt to our changing circumstances, and safeguard ourselves so we are not as affected. it is a matter of where we direct our attention. when we focus on the outer world, we become consumed by its activities and goings-on, and fear of the unknown future takes hold. if, instead, our attention shifts inward through meditation, we experience god’s love and light and recognize god’s presence in our lives. in this state, fear dissipates, and we lead our lives in bliss.
remaining focused on god and choosing to lead a godly life are the answers to the ever-changing ups and downs of life, said sant rajinder singh ji. spiritual masters offer guidance on how to find our closeness with god. they can navigate life’s challenges and, despite all that is going on around them, lead lives filled with peace, calm, and tranquility. this is the promise of the path of love that leads us godward.

								trust in god							

the beauty of god’s unseen hand is that sometimes we actively pray for help and receive it. but there are many times when we do not even ask for help, and help comes anyway.
