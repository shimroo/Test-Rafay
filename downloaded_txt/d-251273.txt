our roots

 











weston garden’s demonstration gardens date all the way back to the 1930’s and 1940’s. these gardens were originally built as a private estate by leon and peggy bandy. developed before air conditioning, every space in the gardens was curated for outdoor entertaining. take a step back in time where it is said that “anyone who was anyone” in fort worth, danced on the rock ship or sun bathed by the creek.
