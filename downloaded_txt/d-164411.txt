welcome to bullet boats
 
at bullet boats we have been building hand built, high quality bass boats for over 30 years.  our mission has always been to design and manufacture a very durable, designed for tournaments, bass boat, that out performs any other bass boat on the market.  the construction methods and materials we use do not allow for mass manufacturing, so production is limited. though not large volume, we produce a high quality, hand laid boat that is well designed and constructed for the tournament angler.
