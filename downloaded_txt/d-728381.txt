     excellent       based on 31 reviews                       matt mckinney     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. i loved having the opportunity to be supported to craft my art as a counsellor. coming from a background of various methodologies already, orca provided a perfect container for me to find myself with my life experience and background, unifying and reimagining my skills in a counselling format. i definitely would recommend this program to those who have a lot to offer by way of helping others who need the guidance and mentoring to bring it into the counselling room.

i really appreciated both sheldon's willingness to make it work for me, and diane's obvious passion and care for mentoring people. i searched for years for a route to bring my gifts into becoming a counsellor and orca was a bit of a miracle for me, when i'd found it. this has been a great life decision. thank you.             charity leach     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. i was with orca institute from november 2020 to march 2023 and have completed the counseling hypnotherapy and counseling skills programs. throughout these past years the support i received was absolutely incredible. i would highly recommend orca to anyone that is interested in developing skills in counseling. thank you to sheldon and diane for helping guide me be becoming a better version of myself.             kim brandt     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. the leaderhsip team is exemplary. my calls or emails were promptly returned. teaching and admin staff were professional and i felt compassionately supported throughout the process. well done and thankyou.             matt lowe     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. orca institute provided we with the foundational skills and learning that i needed to confidently start a private counselling practice.  the teaching methods promoted subject comprehension and application of the material to personal life.  personalized and non-dogmatic learning supported the unique views, life experiences and skill sets that i have to offer as a counsellor.  thank you sheldon, diane and orca faculty.  your raising a much needed, growing family of therapists             benjamin toh     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. very knowledgeable support and good structure of the course assist me in my journey all the way. appreciate everything and a fantastic experience.             alana s. cook     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. the basic hypnosis course at orca institute is a great introduction  to becoming a conscientious and effective hypnotherapist. i resonated deeply with the content of course because it emphasizes the importance of person-centered therapy and ericsonian hypnosis, trusting that the client’s subconscious already knows the best solution. with the guidance of sheldon and diane, and by collaborating with classmates, you can learn these techniques to make a difference in your own life and in the lives of your clients. i highly recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about hypnosis.             flavia shum     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. i recommend orca institute to others based on the following experiences:

1. it allows students to register for the course they need.
2. it allows students to have an extension. many students work part-time or have other commitments. after you notify sheldon and pay the extension fees, you could have a month or two to complete the assignments.
3. you could reach the instructor by phone, email or text message. she will return your message within a reasonable time.
4. you would be inspired by others' sharing in the counselling supervision class.
5. you would feel that orca has a friendly studying environment.             brenda braaten     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. as a graduate of the counselling skills program with orca institute, i highly recommend the program. it is well organized and offers a wealth of practical and relevant learning in order to launch your own private practice. diane and sheldon lead you through the program and provide support whenever needed. they are ready and available to guide you in your growth as a counsellor and to provide feedback that is both helpful and encouraging. diane is amazing and she provides space for you to be yourself and to discover who you are as a counsellor. she values diversity and individuality. as a university graduate i found the program challenging and intensive; this is an in-depth study of counselling skills and your skills will develop and flourish along this journey. i also grew personally as i traveled through each class. i would not hesitate to immerse yourself into the counselling program at orca institute.             shaista fatehali     trustindex verifies that the original source of the review is google. attending orca institute has been a a very fulfilling experience for me both professionally and personally. not only did i learn how to become a counsellor, but i also learned so much about myself as a counsellor. i highly recommend orca to anyone looking to become a counsellor.
