			jun 9, 2022
 by				fathertom				


due to the corona virus, unfortunately, deaths have been at an all-time high throughout the united states.
we have had more than we’d like to handle through our mortuary service, fbc memorial.
as the need for more funeral’s grew, so did our dead body storage facility grew! :(
fortunately, we met with a nationwide commercial refrigeration contractor from church!
he donated a larger cooler to our basement facility recently and we wanted to tell you why we chose this morgue cooler specialist.
with a customized refrigeration unit, a business person is free to have the cooling system as they want it. other than the freedom to get the specific product as preferred, the manufacturer gets the chance to deliver the product according to the request of the client. for that reason, it is beneficial for you to get a customized morgue and flower cooler unit to start your mortuary business. so what are the benefits of having a custom cooler unit for your floral shop?
 

it works according to your needs

usually, refrigeration systems are made with different working systems. in this case, you may purchase a unit that doesn’t work according to your business needs. however, when you have a customized floral cooler unit, it will come with a below-standard cooling system and is big enough to accommodate enough flowers. with such a unit, you will maximize the space availability while cutting down on the power consumption.
 

it offers the needs space

as mentioned, a customized floral cooler unit is made to offer more space while minimizing power usage. so the cooler unit will offer enough space for your business. the design will also be designed according to the available space in your business.


you can upgrade it when you need to

a custom floral cooler unit is designed with a room for improvement or upgrade. there is always space to add something or adjust any other feature when you need to. in that case, if you want to upgrade any of the functionality or size, you can easily request the manufacturer, and they will do it for you. above all, you can request other security features in the cooler unit. for instance, you can request to have cameras in the cooler unit to keep everything safe in the business.
 

you pay what you have

another benefit of having a customized floral cooler unit is that you get to pay what you can afford. top manufacturers will customize the cooler unit according to the size and system requirements. above all, they can customize the cooler unit for you with regard to your budget range. since every feature can be customized, it becomes cheaper for the business person.
 
so if you want a custom floral cooler for your flower business, or you need a morgue cooler for your mortuary service, consider contacting american walk-in coolers. americanwalkincoolers offers floral arrangement coolers that come at different prices, and you can get what you want according to your business preferences. they are also available whenever you need their services 24-7. american walk-in coolers also offer financing options for all their refrigeration units which we were so grateful to take advantage of. thank you awic you are truly a blessed company!

			when is it time for daycare or preschool?



			may 25, 2022
 by				fathertom				

when is the right time to take your child to preschool? this is a question that many parents are asking. they want to know if they can take their children to school if they are past the recommended age. normally, most preschools will accept children at around 3 years, or two and a half. however, it is not a must that you should take your child to preschool when they hit that specific age. rather, it is all about noting specific signs. yes, your child might be passed three years, but he/she may not be exactly ready to start preschool. so how will you know if your little angel is ready? here are some of the signs to watch out for:

 he prepares his bed every morning
 
if your boy gets up and makes his bed before leaving the bedroom it could be a sign that he is learning to be responsible for his own mess. normally, children will wake up and head out of the bedroom and the mother will go make the bed for them. so if he is starting to do things on his own, you should consider taking him to school.
 
 he wants to go play with other kids
 
some kids are introverts while others just don’t like hanging around with others. it could be a stage or it could be that the kid is naturally less-social. so if he reaches a stage where he just wants to go out and mingle with other kids in the playground, you might want to consider taking him to school. it could be a sign that he wants to be involved with kids of his own age. he will enjoy more of that in a preschool.
 
he wants to draw or write stuff all the time

the kid could also want to draw or write stuff all the time, which is a sign that he wants to learn a thing or two. when he does this, you might want to consider taking him to a good preschool. also, try to encourage what he does by challenging him with more tasks.
 
she washes her own cup/plate
 
now, this might not be a must, but if your kid tends to wash her plate or cup when he is done eating, it is a sign that she is learning to be responsible. the best way to encourage that is to take the child to preschool so that she can learn more.
 
when choosing a preschool for your child, always consider a reputable center that has a good record for rearing kids properly, like the vine learning center daycare in san diego, ca

			how to improve your spiritual growth



			jan 31, 2022
 by				fathertom				

read spiritual and uplifting books.
think about how what you read can be used in your life to grow not only on the earthly plane but also on a more transcendent plane.
as always, when it comes to reading, choose your books carefully. dedicate part of your time to find out about those best-known books and those that have good references. use the internet to find out which authors are the best in their field.
meditation is the best technique to achieve spiritual growth.
do you know the positive effects that meditation has? meditate for at least 15 minutes every day. if you don’t know how to meditate, it’s easy to find books, websites, or teachers who can teach you how to meditate.
look inside yourself often.
try to figure out what it is that makes you feel alive. connect with those aspects that make you see beyond material things. those are the things that are really worth it.
think positive.
if your thoughts are negative immediately start thinking positive. pay attention to what enters your mind. open the door to the positive aspects of life and put a fence around the negative ones.
develop the habit of happiness.
always look for the bright side of life and try to be happy. happiness comes from within. don’t let external circumstances decide your happiness.
check out this video to see the three ways to better your spiritual growth.
