welcome


welcome to the sweet home missionary baptist church.   
it is our prayer that our website will serve and assist you in becoming familiar with our church and our ministry.  take your time and peruse our site to see why many in prattsville, ar and surrounding communities call sweet home “home!”
the goal of our website is to share our relationship with god; to fulfill our responsibility to nurture believers, and to inform unbelievers.  we want to share the blessed hope to a lost and dying hopeless world.
if you are unfamiliar with our church and your first contact with us is through our website, we really want to hear from you!  please let us know what your needs are and how we can serve you.
we are delighted that you have stopped by our website and anticipate your visit to our church very soon.
