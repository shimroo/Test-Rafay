welcome to 
          matagorda, texas.... 
          our coastal matagorda weather will soon be starting to warm up.... a 
          bit cold here now, and along with that, the bay and surf fishing, plus 
          all the fun to be had on sunny matagorda beach. matagorda bay fishing 
          is always the main focus here and catching those big trout in matagorda 
          bay continues to be the quest of many anglers along with bull reds from 
          the surf....!

the 
          new bridge over the intracoastal waterway was completed several years 
          ago and that makes beach access a lot easier for those visitors wanting 
          to get sandy. the bridge also gives us some great views of east matagorda 
          bay. time 
          certainly has not stood still and there have been lots of changes in 
          the past years and more to come! 
many 
          new matagorda vacation rentals properties and restaurants have sprung 
          up offering visitors to matagorda and matagorda bay more great places 
          to stay, eat and relax! still, much of the town is as it was a quarter 
          century or more ago, but "progress" has definitely taken hold.....take 
          a look at matagorda, texas as it is today and yesterday....
