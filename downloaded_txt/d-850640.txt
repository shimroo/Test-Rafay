“on the other side of every fear is freedom.”marilyn ferguson












about me

the whole dang storywhile studying political science and philosophy at the university of southern maine, i authored a thesis (for the university’s honors program) exploring the societal impacts of networked technology. later that year, i published the virtual journal, the world’s first web magazine (while at the same university that brought the first bitnet magazine, vm/com, to the world nine years earlier) – and with it, selling the first web ads to hayes and mitsubishi. it was my first lesson that being early (or first) is rarely rewarded by the marketplace. 🙃after that, i served as chief technology advisor to maine governor angus king [now us senator], helping maine set an early example of responsive, secure online government. governor king appointed me to the blue-ribbon united states highway one advisory commission, where i served with senate and congressional leaders to address issues ranging from broadband access to cybersecurity.i was an early team member of pop!tech, an exceptional annual conference about the intersection of technology and culture, and chaired the conference for three years.i started brainpaste.com, the company that invented dynamic customer acquisition. industry guru don tapscott said brainpaste posed “a new challenge to the old order” and usa today said it “uncorks an idea that can never be put back in the bottle.” this once-radical e-commerce method now facilitates billions of dollars in online commerce each year. (this would serve as my second lesson about being early.) brainpaste was acquired by entertainment network r3media, and i became their chief communications officer.a year later, i teamed up with fellow communications pros and started fama pr, a boston-based brand communications agency. over the next few years, we built the agency into one of the leading independent pr firms in the us. i departed fama pr in 2006, embarked on a year-long globe-wandering sabbatical, and then relocated to coastal los angeles.i helped launch edgecast networks, an early contender in the cdn/intelligent cloud business, and served as its head of communications and marketing for the life of the company. when edgecast was acquired by verizon for $400m, we carried almost ten percent of the world’s internet traffic and our 5,000 customers included the web’s busiest sites such as twitter, tumblr, yahoo, wordpress, etsy, pinterest, and disney-abc. following verizon’s acquisition, i became chief evangelist and head of communications of verizon’s digital media unit, a position i held until i left the company.most recently i was founder and ceo of acquicent, a fintech company that built a saas marketplace for trading shares in collectibles such as classic cars and fine art. you may have seen the company in the economist, forbes, bloomberg, or any number of its network tv appearances.over the years, i have consulted for dozens of corporations, elected officials, non-profits, and law enforcement agencies on issues ranging from communications to cybersecurity to drug policy.i served on the grassroots finance committee of obama for america. that was my third engagement with a major political campaign, having worked for bill clinton as his state student coordinator, and on angus king’s successful bid to become the nation’s only independent governor.i am also a frequent commentator on american culture, regularly pontificating in and contributing to media outlets including the huffington post, money, consumerist, the new york times, investor’s business daily, the wall street journal, and wired.last but not least, i am an occasional photographer. my photography has earned more than 100 print credits ranging from time and the wall street journal to niche fashion magazines you’ve never heard of.i live in venice, california. come visit!
