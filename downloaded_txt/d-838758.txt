preserve
we pursue our mission to preserve naval history in two ways, through the methods established in the naval order constitution and through our history preservation partnerships with other naval history organizations.










promote
promoting naval history increases public awareness of the battles, service and sacrifice that are part of the nation’s sea services.  










celebrate
we celebrate because “it is well and fitting that the illustrious deeds of the great naval commanders, their companion officers in arms, and their subordinates in the wars of the united states should be forever honored and respected.”
