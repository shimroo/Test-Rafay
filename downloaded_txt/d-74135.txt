external engagement




we aim to make an impact on individuals, organisations and communities that have to design, develop, build and manage complex systems involving technologies of all kinds. our disciplines combine both analysis and synthesis, ranging from engineering, through design and systems thinking to environmental and technology management.
we take a broad view of engineering and innovation in all our activities. our teaching covers many forms of formal, non-formal and informal courses and educational resources. our wide ranging research and scholarship covers several research excellence framework (ref) units of assessment. our expertise is used in various commercial, not-for-profit and grant funded activities both nationally and internationally.  
we are committed to the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion and aim to enhance our reach into, and impact on, currently underserved groups and organisations in line with the open university’s mission.
