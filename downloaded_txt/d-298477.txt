ocean freedom
july 25, 2014
just got off the magnificent ocean freedom machine. what a vessel, what wonderfull helpful staff. i had dived before in tahiti 20 years ago and felt comfortable, but today i could get a grip of it and with as much help and reassurance from the staff i couldn't dive today. no matter at all as the snorkelling is amazing and the barracuda swimming around the back of the boat was truly amazing. there are 4 different places to relax and we used them all at some point during the day. money very well spent and i would recommend this to anyone at any level of competence.
