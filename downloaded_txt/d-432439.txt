			about this place
		
destination


				after 45 minutes of flight from tahiti, you can see both islands, raiatea and taha'a. the island of taha'a, uporu by its ancient name, is located in the society islands,  in the same lagoon as the island of raiatea. raiatea played a major role in polynesian migrations throughout the pacific ocean and is still an important historical and cultural center, witness of well-alive civilization and traditions.
			

				taha'a is also known as the vanilla island. its fertile land and climate produce what chefs and gourmets around the world think is the tastiest, most fragrant vanilla on earth. tahitian pearls are also produced in taha'a. a few pearl farms take advantage of the island's pure lagoon to grow endless variations of the famous pearl.
