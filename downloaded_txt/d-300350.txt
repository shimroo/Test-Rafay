volunteer opportunities  abc basset hound rescue will be welcoming 3 month old puppies into rescue! photos will be provided when available.adoption fee: $400 + $100 depositfoster location: various locations throughout nys & paavailable: approximately may 21-28please read the approval & adoption requirements below before submitting an adoption application. a veterinarian reference check & home check are required as part of the approval process.*the veterinarian check will include verifying the applicant’s past/present dog(s) is/are altered (spayed/neutered), current on vaccines (not just rabies), tested negative for heartworm & on monthly preventatives.meet & greets are only scheduled for approved applicants, if required.
the puppies would do best in a home rather than an apartment, condominium or townhouse since they are quite “talkative.”the adoption fee is $400
the puppies are not yet altered. the adopter will be responsible for having their puppy spayed or neutered, at their own expense, signing a spay/neuter contract & providing a $100 deposit.the deposit will be refunded once proof of spay or neuter is received within 6 months of adopting.age-related vaccines may also be required & will be the adopter’s responsibility.we are not offering transport for puppies therefore the adopter will need to pick their puppy up at the foster home.please note: we do not adopt out pairs or siblings. here is a link explaining why: https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/adopting-littermates-dontif you are interested in being considered for adoption, please submit an application: https://nybasset.org/basset-hound-for-adoption/adoption-application/
