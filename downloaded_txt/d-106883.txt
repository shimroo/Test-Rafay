san antonio tv sportscaster arrested





oh, c’mon he’s sports guy. how do you expect him to behave. i wonder if kens-tv covered this story?san antonio -- kens-tv sportscaster joe reinagel was arrested and charged monday with public intoxication and disorderly conduct. according to a police report, reinagel showed up at a hospital sunday night to see his wife, dia joy reinagel, who had complained of chest pains shortly after she was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving. the report stated that a police officer said that joe reinagel had red eyes and smelled of alcohol.the officer also stated in his report that while joe reinagel was visiting with his wife, the officer could hear the sportscaster using profanity to refer to him. the officer then pulled reinagel from the room and tried to calm him down when reinagel allegedly used more profanity -- this time to the officer's face. "he, in fact, was intoxicated himself," san antonio police spokesman gabe trevino said. "he was very aggressive as the officer tried to speak with him. it was a situation where he was yelling at the arresting officer in the wating room." reinagel was then arrested. he appeared before a magistrate and was released on his own recognizance. he is scheduled to appear in court march 8. "it's stupidity," reinagel said about his arrest after he was released. after being released from the hospital, dia joy reinagel will be charged with drunken driving and resisting arrest, trevino said. dia joy reinagel, a self-employed publicist, was stopped by police for allegedly driving 86 mph in a 65 mph speed zone on loop 1604 near babcock road. ksat-tv, february 27, 2007

handel loses his handletop radio host in the country gets pissed off when another hosts kicks his kids out of his studio. why is it that right wing talk radio hosts can dish out, but can's take it?kfi/los angeles personality bill handel got a little hot under the collar with jamie white, morning hostess at clear channel clusterpal kysr (star 98.7), on the air this morning. handel, who occasionally brings his kids to work, went into star's studio and began yelling at white live, allegedly because she threw his kids out of her studio.according to a clip that aired on ktla-tv this morning, white opened the exchange by telling handel, "i just pointed at your kids with my orange flute and told them don't come back." handel angrily responded, "if you ever talk to my kids that way again, jamie, i am going to kick your ass. you are not allowed to talk to them! are you telling me they can't be on the fifth floor?"white shot back, "i'm telling them they can't be right there," to which handel yelled, "you have such goddamn losing numbers on this loser show. shut up! you don't talk to my kids that way." handel also shouted, "don't you touch me!" which suggests that someone was trying to force him out of the studio -- right before he dropped a couple of f-bombs on his way out.radio and records, december 15, 2006handel gets week's suspension for on-air tiradethe great clear channel/los angeles battle of titans has resulted in a one week suspension for talk kfi-a morning star bill handel, to be served upon his return from his previously-scheduled two week vacation. handel, in an incident that landed on local cw affiliate ktla (tv)'s morning news show and, subsequently, on youtube, burst into modern ac kysr (star 98.7)'s studios and yelled at star morning host jamie white for throwing his twin daughters out of her studio and threatening "if you ever talk to my kids like that again, jamie, i'm going to kick your ass." handel also dropped a pair of "f-bombs," but star says that they were caught by the delay system and did not air (the ktla tape appears to have come from a pre-delay skimmer tape). in a statement, handel apologized for his outburst, saying "i want to apologize to jamie and her team for my behavior and how i handled the unfortunate incident this morning. it was simply a reaction of a dad who was protecting his children. i lost my temper, i lost my cool." allaccess.com december 18, 2006
