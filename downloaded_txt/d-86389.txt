moor instruments, a global leader in innovative products for tissue blood flow and oxygen assessment.


pre-clinical, clinical and research applications

hind limb ischemia (hli)the hind limb ischemia angiogenesis experimental model is a well-established and popular “gold standard” tool to test and quantify the effect of novel therapies on the formation and development of new blood vessels – the process known as angiogenesis.stroke model (mcao)the middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao) model is a commonly used technique for the creation of a stroke model. laser doppler is typically used in order to confirm that occlusion has taken place and ischaemia has occurred.skin perfusion pressure (spp)skin perfusion pressure (spp) is the pressure required for restoring microcirculatory blood flow following release of carefully controlled occlusion. the measurement of spp with laser doppler is a non-invasive test.pulp vitality testlaser doppler is considered more reliable than sensory testing for pulp vitality testing. this is because there can be adequate vascularisation to support tooth pulp vitality even when sensation is lost due to nerve damage.

testimonials

we are pleased to be able to share recommendations from existing customers.
we began to use moor instruments laser-doppler flowmeters in our human cardiovascular physiology studies after meeting the company founder, dr dave boggett at an experimental biology meeting in the early 1990's. dr. boggett's enthusiasm for improving ldf was clear to us and resulted in a relationship between our lab and moor that has lasted to this day. we have used laser-doppler flowmetry as well as imaging equipment from moor with great success. we have found moor equipment to be extremely dependable and innovative. we look forward to additional innovative laser-doppler equipment from moor that will expand the questions we can address.dean l. kellogg, jr., md, ph.duniversity of texas health science centeri have been using moor instruments laser doppler systems for over 20 years, having purchased 3 imager systems, a full field perfusion imager and several iontophoresis systems. the equipment has provided excellent tools for exploring human microvascular function in a non-invasive manner. the company has always been extremely helpful and cooperative in accommodating my requirements and after-sales help has always been to a high standard. i expect to be using moor instrument’s technology for many years to come!faisel khan, phdninewells hospital & medical schoolwe bought a moorflpi-2 two-dimensional imaging system to measure the cerebral blood flow (cbf) of adult mice during and after hypoxic-ischemic insults. we found this to be a powerful, yet extremely easy-to-use system that provides a global view of cbf alterations in various conditions. with this system, not only we can see cbf alterations in both hemispheres in real-time and without opening the skull, but also we can quantify the average flow units in any region-of-interest over any segment of the entire recording, which can run more than hours without freezing the computer. in a nutshell, moorflpi-2 is the most user-friendly system for studying cerebral blood flow regulation in rodents.chia-yi (alex) kuan, md, phdemory university school of medicinemuch of our work in human physiological science is monitoring the development of disease and possible interventions to counteract those changes. having the best possible measurements made simple and hassle free has been invaluable to our success in driving new understanding of physiological mechanisms and in the development of new technologies for treatment of disease and performance enhancement. our work with industry also demands that we get things right, we need the best equipment! we can't recommend moor instruments highly enough. the technology is at the cutting edge and the support second to none.paul sumners, phdlondon south bank universityduring the course of my clinical studies examining the vascular complications associated with diabetes i have used a number of moor instruments, ranging from laser doppler products, skin heaters and iontophoresis controllers. their equipment has been invaluable to my research and have contributed to research studies that have examined the mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction in diabetes and prediabetes as well as evaluating the impact of therapeutic interventions on the development and progression of these complications. moor instruments have consistently provided excellent help and support for my research.kim gooding, phduniversity of exeter medical schooli have been using moor instruments laser doppler flowmeters for almost 20 years, in a number of extreme environments laboratories. the equipment is robust, reliable, and and affords very sensitive measurement. some of our sensors and equipment are more than 10 years old remain in regular use when our main newer systems are fully engaged. we have used various moor systems over the years for assessing human thermoregulatory responses to a variety of extreme environments including heat, cold, altitude, and occasionally in or underwater. we also use the sensors to help medical colleagues to diagnose non-freezing cold-injuries, and to assess their severity. the company are a pleasure to deal with and respond very quickly to requests. i cannot rate the company or the staff highly enough.jim house, phduniversity of portsmouthi use laser doppler imaging in quantifying cerebral blood flow in stroke and traumatic brain injury research. having used other methods to determine effect of stroke or brain injury on cerebral perfusion and blood flow like microspheres, cranial window, probes - the laser doppler imager is easier to use, does not involve any invasive or surgical procedures. in the laboratory settings, it is very user friendly and the quantification package that comes with it is a life saver especially for students and technicians. moreover, the data is well correlated to the other methods and predictions. laser doppler imager is a standard accurate method we now use in our cerebral blood flow and brain perfusion in our laboratory.momoh a. yakubu, phdtexas southern universityi am very pleased to be writing a quote for the moor instruments, uk. i have had a few experiences interacting with the after sales service team regarding the moorldi2-ir machine, which is installed in our university research lab. my 'burning' questions regarding the machine's operations and data analysis when put before them were answered in no time by the team, which i think is just fantastic. it goes without saying that the company's imaging technology itself is superb!
