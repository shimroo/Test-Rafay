your time to fly has come!

 












feel the freedom of higher consciousnessmaureen higgins, ma, helps you soar into your best life as you recognize you’re a divine being having a human experience! being human, we tend to identify with the positive and negative experiences in life and hold them on a cellular level. many times, we identify with our problems so deeply that we believe we are our problems. this can be the core of our inner stress and drive how we feel about ourselves, others, and our life.  wings of freedom uses a mind, body, and spirit approach to resolve inner conflicts so you feel happier and lighter inside. this connects you to your spiritual essence and path so you can bring your gifts and talents more fully into the world. maureen has developed several transformational energy healing techniques to assist you in letting go of the past and moving onto your optimal path. all earthly experiences are temporary and meant to be embraced and learned from.  she believes we both create and have the ability to change our reality by working through and transforming our personal, ancestral, and karmic issues. over the past 26 years, she has helped thousands of people to experience these life-changing shifts through personal sessions, classes, and audios. let's join hands and do this work together!
