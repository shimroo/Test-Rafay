dear friends,
            as many of you know, we love km and have been a
        personal consumer for many years. in addition, recently we have discovered an
        outstanding health product that delivers incredible energy and
        nutrition, especially useful in these trying times: "peak
        performance nutrition pack", by melaleuca.
            i have experienced extremely positive health benefits
        from the peak performance nutrition pack and i am excited to share this
        good news with you. please visit behappybehealthy.com
        to join me in this renewed health experience, or call me directly at
        518-320-7153
        wishing you all continued great health,
        jonathan ragonese
