        the us english manual, that is used as the base for translations, is
        known to contain outdated sections, errors and omissions. please note
        that both this manual and the translations are works in progress and
        may be incomplete. we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
      

        to improve the manual and translations we are looking for more
        volunteers to help us out. if you are interested in
        writing documentation for the
        english language manual, or in
        translating the manual, then
        please get in contact with us.
      


      the online user manuals are updated once a day. after each language
      (except the us english manual), it lists the completion status, i.e. what
      percentage of the manual has been translated. the order of the languages
      is based on their language code.
