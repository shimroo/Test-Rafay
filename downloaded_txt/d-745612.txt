dr. brian hass

            dr. brian hass says he didn’t choose plastic surgery as much as it chose him. as early as medical school, his meticulous technique and attention to detail made it obvious to both him and his senior surgeons that plastic surgery would best suit his inherent skills and sense of aesthetics. upon meeting dr b, you will quickly recognize this precision underlies his warm open manner. patients quickly warm to dr b, and trust him to deliver dependable results in a friendly and caring environment. “the key to my success as a plastic surgeon is really two things: listening and seeing.

an uplifting experience
palm beach gardens facelift

facelift surgery is designed to correct the signs of aging in order to give a patient uplifted contours and improved tone for their facial skin and underlying muscles. at hass plastic surgery, a facelift does not change your fundamental appearance by making you look windswept. in fact, you will look beautiful, refreshed, and rejuvenated. although you will continue to age naturally, your aging will progress from the more youthful version of yourself that has been restored by facial surgery.

high brow beauty
eye & brow lifts in palm beach

              you have an eye for beauty. let the world see it with an eyelid lift or brow lift. our specialists know how to artfully restore the eyes to create a youthful and vibrant appearance through blepharoplasty (eyelid lifts) and brow lifts. while they don’t get as much attention as the facelift, these two procedures can produce results for the upper half of the face that are just as impactful as a facelift for the middle and lower parts of the face. our eye specialists have performed these procedures daily for decades, blending the latest techniques with their own incredible experience to create exceptional results.

resculpt and contour
body in palm beach

              you’ve probably heard something about how liposuction involves removing fat from areas you would like to look more sculpted. but that’s not the whole story. what happens to the fat after it’s removed? that’s up to you and your surgeon at hass plastic surgery. in our trained hands, the fat we take from liposuction can be repurposed to add volume to other places where it can further accent your natural beauty, including the hands, face, breasts, or
              even a brazilian butt lift. it’s your fat. don’t just lose it. put it to work.

              it’s important to exercise and eat healthy to preserve your looks and your health. but no amount of exercise or diet can fully correct skin laxity (sagging skin). if your abdominal skin has stretched to the point where it won’t snap back on its own, the best way to absolutely remove the excess skin and restore a smoother, flatter tummy is with a tummy tuck. our highly skilled plastic surgeons deliver excellent results on our drainless tummy tucks to ensure you get the looks you want in a way that maximizes your care and comfort throughout the process. this service is often included in a tailored series of procedures well known as a mommy makeover.

              restylane, and lip injections. our dermal filler and injectables treatments follow your treatment plan to the letter, so your look is beautiful, natural, and just right.
