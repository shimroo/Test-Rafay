jockstrap history







the 
				jockstrap was invented in 1874 by c. f. bennett of a chicago 
				sporting goods company, sharp & smith, to provide comfort and 
				support for bicycle jockeys riding the cobblestone streets of 
				boston. in 1897 bennett's newly-formed bike web company patented 
				and began mass-producing the bike jockey strap. the bike web 
				company later became known as the bike company. today, bike is 
				still the market leader in jockstrap sales.
