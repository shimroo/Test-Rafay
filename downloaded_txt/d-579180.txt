i want to express my deepest gratitude to the residents of pottsville, my colleagues in city government, and all the people behind the scenes who work tirelessly to make our community a better place. your support and encouragement have meant the world to me, and i am confident that our city will continue to thrive for future generations.

black rock press release (march 14, 2024)
in an effort to avert a number of potential issues, i would like to respond to the "black rock free beer giveaway." as you can imagine, this is a problematic matter. if the city shuts down the black rock free beer event, we are viewed by some as "the big bad city of pottsville," keeping a business closed. if nothing is done, someone could get injured or sick, and we are not holding each business to the same standards of health and safety.
the owner of black rock brewing company must comply with the same codes that every other business must meet. after the fire, black rock was given several opportunities to reopen by correcting specific issues. that path was not taken. the new approach was not to reopen; it included additional changes that required plans. those new plans and drawings have been reviewed on severl occasions by the city and a review board. both have agreed that black rock has not met code standards. he has chosen to now take that to the county courthouse.
several other businesses have opened over the past few years in pottsville, all investing in their locations to meet code and have successful businesses. we are not sure why compliance with the law is a problem in this case. code officials and the fire chief have offered plans and suggestions to get black rock back open in a very timely manner.
with the safety of our citizens and visitors in mind, the free beer event at black rock brewing company is not possible. for the sake of public safety and fairness to other businesses who follow the rules, we must stop this event from taking place. myself, city council, fire chief, police chief, code office, and city solicitor believe that this is the proper decision and are asking for your understanding and support.
mayor dave clews

black rock press release (july 10, 2023)
as with every situation, there are two sides, so goes the black rock and city matter. you've read or heard the black rock side, now it's time for the city to simply present the facts of the matter.
yes, on may 17th there was a kitchen fire at black rock. yes, a police vehicle in passing, heard the alarms and called it in, which dispatched the pottsville fire department. yes, the police officer was able to enter the building, find a fire extinguisher and put the fire out. and, yes, our first responders risked injury to help a city business. if the police were in a different area of pottsville, this could have been a much bigger fire. smoke detectors were not phone connected for emergency dispatch. although not required for code, alarms with emergency connection are just smart business practice. it should be noted that the kitchen contained a deep fryer and flat top grill without a fire suppression system that were installed after the initial inspection was completed.
the pottsville fire department arrived and checked the entire building for smoke and fire. yes, a few days after, code officers, both city and third party along with the fire chief, arrived at black rock as is standard procedure for any fire. this is done to make sure the building is safe to reopen. yes, a city government official was also with them. i was that city official and was there to make clear to all that this visit was for public safety and not a political points chase. i stayed for the basement and first floor inspections. i left before the second floor inspection, which by that time uncovered 50 violations. some were very simple to fix, some violations were more serious. examples included numerous uncovered electric junction boxes, several emergency lights not working, and smoke and carbon detectors missing. the improper use of electrical cords was observed where an electrical cord was run from the basement into a second story window. a string light cords were being used to power electric space heaters in the bathrooms. there were additional electrical violations discovered, several missing fire doors, as well as an obstructed path to the panel boxes. when the inspection was complete, all code officers and the fire chief sat down and showed bobby weaver what needed to be done to reopen safely. the code officers and fire chief then returned to city hal and put together a written itemized list to be addressed, which was then delivered to mr. weaver as soon as possible allowing him to clean up and get corrections underway.
it should also be noted that black rock was operating with a temporary occupancy permit due to covid delays that prevented some in person inspections. the city of pottsville did what we could to assist black rock to open so they could start earning income - important for all parties, the weavers for personal income, the city of pottsville for the tax base, and to assist other community partners to see a return on the several hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in the project. the citty of pottsville has continually tried to work with bobby weaver on the black rock project, even holding a meeting with his attorney and architect along with the city attorney, code officers, and city officials.
it only makes sense for a business so invested in another business (city of pottsville) to assist and guide the business invested in (black rock) to success and longevity.
i find it interesting that while bobby weaver was the president of the pottsville area development corporation (padco), he noted all of the successful businesses that have opened over the past 3 years, all code compliant and open for business. the pottsville business association is working on sharing all those success stories as well. but yet, bobby weaver claims it's difficult to do business in pottsville. i've made it a point to tell all city employees that, "as a business owner, i view each entrepreneur, owner, and citizen as a customer. i expect these people to be treated as such." i've attended many ribbon cuttings for new businesses along with members of city council, with more opening soon. business has moved here from other towns and more inquire all the time. in the past 48 months, the city of pottsville has invested more than $1.2 million directiy to pottsville business development. this fact shows the level of commitment that city has shown to economic development.
i believe it is also important to address the issue of fair code administration and communication. yes, each commercial project requires appropriate stamped drawings. the city did not request or receive eight (8) sets of plans regarding black rock. to date, the city has received three (3) sets of drawings for the black rock brewing company. the first set was approved in february 2021 for the use of the first floor and basement. the second set of drawings was submitted earlier this year for the use of th second floor and were denied. the drawings were submitted after two years of discussions with the owner on what was required to open the second floor. this includes a hearing requesting relief from installing a sprinkler system which was denied by the board of appeals. six (6) complaints were filed by mr. weaver with the pennsylvania department of labor and industry in regards to this matter. all complaints were responded to by the department with "no merit" showing that the submission was appropriately denied. the third set of drawings was submitted june 22, 2023 for revisions to the building. these drawings were denied because the fire suppression system was not included with the submission as well as issues with the occupant load calculations.
now, i would like to address the issue of communication. the city of pottsville has worked closely with this project from the very beginning. between may 17th and june 28th alone, there have been over 60 emails between the city, mr. weaver, and his design professional. in addition, there have been countless phone calls. contact with mr. weaver and his design professional was almost daily during this period.
the city of pottsville has a responsibility to make our community safe. the proper enforcement of building codes is our most important tool. it would be unsafe and unfair to expect some businesses to comply with minimum code requirements and exempt others. we must enforce the same codes to all commercial establishments. building codes are not specific to pottsville. they are state minimum requirements for how structural, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and other systems are designed and constructed.
the codes ensure that buildings provide adequate safeguards for occupants to reach safety in the event of a fire. this means clearly marking exits and egress routes out of the building. there also needs to be an adequate lighting and notification systems to promptly notify occupants in the event of a fire.
backup egress routes also need to be clearly defined to get occupants to safety in case a primary egress route fails. fire suppression systems need to be installed where required to protect the occupants of the building and also the structure from catastrophe. our goal is to protect the life, health, and safety of the occupants of any structure by ensuring that the minimum safeguards are in place.
as mayor of pottsville, i will ensure that we will work with this and every city business. i have owned and worked in retail for more than 30 years. i fully understand the value that small business adds to our community, as well as the challenges that we all face to be operational and resilient.
we remain committed to assisting residents, businesses, schools, churches, and nonprofits to add to this great community. the city of pottsville only asks for cooperation and compliance with basic safety standards.
