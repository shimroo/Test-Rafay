fund focus





drill down to the all-important details for the complete picture: description, performance, and most 
                    importantly, our proprietary data on fundamentals and investment merit such as sales and earnings growth, estimate 
                    revisions and valuation metrics, and much more.








portfolio builder





create and maintain up to 20 all-etf portfolios. see sector and geographic allocation, fundamentals 
                    and valuation metrics for the entire portfolio, and how each of these compares to your benchmark. 
                    ideal for "hands on" financial advisors who want to manage etf portfolios for clients.










fund screening





quickly screen hundreds of etfs, going well beyond the basics of fees and past performance. whether 
                    your investment strategy is deep value, growth at any price or somewhere in between, you can screen funds
                    based on criteria that matter to you.








watchlist





found a few great etfs that might have a place for your portfolio, but not sure now is
                    the right time to trade? put them on your watchlist for monitoring, 
                    so you can be ready to pounce when conditions are right.










stock locator





etfs are a great way to hedge single-stock risk, especially around earnings and other corporate
                    events, but which etfs are best for this? stock locator allows you to enter a stock's ticker 
                    and get a list of all etfs with exposure, and how much they hold.








fund overlap





with so many etfs available, it's no wonder many of them have considerable overlap among
                    their underlying holdings. the overlap tool shows you just how much two etfs have in common, which 
                    can be particularly helpful when evaluating "smart beta" funds.
