a handweaver's craft

rosepath weaving 
                creates hand woven textiles for the home and 
                public spaces that are a pleasure to see, touch and use.  
                products are available to purchase or simply view at various boston area 
                events.  everything is woven, start to finish, by the single weaver 
                who employs traditional techniques, and uses a computer only for design.
				








weaving was my hobby 
                    for over thirty years while i was a 
                computer software engineer. in 1969 a creative friend dashing off scarves on a small floor loom introduced me to weaving. love at first sight! since then, iâve owned a series of ever-larger looms allowing me to weave very wide pieces.  all kinds of weaves in natural fibers attract me.
in 2001 i exchanged technology for the weavers' guild of boston where i earned a journeyman rating.  marshfield school of weaving workshops have inspired me to study and weave historic textiles. for many years now, i've volunteered at the  carlisle historical society helping to repair and weave on their c. 1820 loom. more at chs loom.
