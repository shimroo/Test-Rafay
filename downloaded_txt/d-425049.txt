  our history:

currahee mountain stands alone at the southern tip of the blue ridge mountains and rises more than 1,700 feet above sea level. the native americans of the cherokee nation named the mountain currahee (quu-wa-hi) meaning âstands aloneâ as the mountain rises above the hills and valleys of northeast georgia.
during wwii, the u.s. army selected currahee mountain and the surrounding land as the site for the 101st airborne division, parachute infantry training center called camp toccoa. the mountain drew international recognition in the tom hanks film, band of brothers. the mini-series provided an intimate portrayal of the american paratroopers, easy company.  every day the airmen would run three miles up and three miles down currahee, and the name of the mountain would become the motto for their campaign: âwe stand alone together.â here, the men of easy company trained intensely as they prepared for the largest battle and assimilation of force that the world has ever known and we recognize today as d-day, june 6th, 1944. 
the history of currahee mountain and the spirit of working together as a unified team lives on with patterson pump company. patterson resides upon the same hallowed ground where camp toccoa was established. today the employees of patterson pump company stand-alone together as the custom pump manufacturer the world turns to for pumping solutions.
