more about this site and the reviews

established over two decades ago, this site is providing clear, trustworthy, independent photography and gear advice to millions of people annually.
you are here because you want great pictures – we are here to make your images amazing!
we can show you the gear you need to capture them and provide advice in the use of that gear.
bookmark this page now because you are going to want to come back often to use the vast resources available here – and to stay up to date on what is happening in the photography world via our news page!


canon & sony camera & lens reviews

the-digital-picture.com aims to be a voice of clarity in a world full of noise.
it is a marketing department's job to tell you that they are (always) delivering amazing products.
we (you and i) know that what the design and production departments provide is seldom completely in-synch with what marketing is telling us.
this site aims to concisely (your time is valuable) tell you what you need to know about cameras, lenses, and related accessories while providing in-depth product details unavailable elsewhere.
a huge effort is made to deliver accurate reviews trusted enough that, included in this site's visitor count, are employees of some of the largest photographic retailers in the industry.
i am confident that you too will find the reviews invaluable!


camera & lens recommendations

uniquely qualifying the advice given here is that, with very few exceptions, i have owned or used at least one copy of every canon dslr and mirrorless interchangeable lens (milc) camera and lens sold in the last 17 years, plus many discontinued canon models and
many nikon, sigma, tamron, tokina, samyang, sony, and zeiss lenses also.
as you know, the best lens is only the best lens for you if it fits within your budget, if it delivers the image quality you need, if it has the right focal length range, and if it has the other features you need.
let this site guide you through the dslr camera and lens selection process.


camera & lens comparison tools

the site's comparison tools let you see a camera and lens' performance with your own eyes.
the test results are useful for not only evaluating one camera or lens's performance but for directly comparing results to those of any another camera/lens – at your choice of focal length and aperture settings.
if you cannot see the difference in our test results, you will not likely see them in your images.
our lens test file folder has over 75,000 painstakingly-captured test files in it.
these test results are captured in a specially-equipped lab environment.
don't miss our incredible, extremely-popular lens image quality comparison tool featuring actual image crops of an enhanced iso 12233 chart test target.


camera & lens sample pictures

be inspired!
visit the site's sample picture galleries to view quality sample pictures captured with specific cameras and lenses.
discover the imagery the camera or lens you are interested in is capable of producing.
become a better photographer by reading the comments and tips presented here and by learning the camera and lens settings used to capture the images.


canon lens information

canon is producing an incredible line of lenses.
learn what you need to know about used lenses (do you save money by buying used?), gray market lenses, the age of a lens, and much more information relevant to the canon rf, rf-s, ef, ef-s, ef-m, ts-e, and mp-e lenses.


photography tips

having great gear is only part of the photography equation.
this site will help you use, protect, maintain, and travel with that gear.
