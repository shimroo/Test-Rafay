meet jenny

























jenny has been capturing real moments since she learned how to make a pinhole camera out of an oatmeal canister. at 12 years old, she upgraded to her first real camera, a pentax k1000, and fell in love with photography while developing black and white film in the darkroom. the process hasn’t gotten old to her–capturing and sharing life’s purest moments.more about jenny →

mel robbins“there’s only one person i trust to get the shot i need, it’s jenny.”













tamsen fadal"i love my pictures, but more importantly i love who they have helped me become."  













becca levian, skye high“her creativity is endless - constantly coming up with new shot ideas while keeping me at ease the entire time.”













beth berry"it was clear that she truly saw me, and that her goal was to capture my essence, rather than trying to make me look a certain way at the expense of my authenticity."













rana wilson“she not only made me feel easy in front of the camera but captured my brand perfectly.”













amy birks“when you sent the photos i was beside myself. i could not believe how well you captured my essence and vibrancy.”
