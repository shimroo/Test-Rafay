 welcome to the steam automobile club of america
the steam automobile bulletin comes to all members. to the members outside north america, the bulletin is supplied as a full color pdf file, and you can also have the heavy black-and-white printed bulletin in the mail if you also pay for the mailing expense. we have discovered that a member in europe can take the pdf file to a local copy shop and print the thing in color for less than the mailing cost!
