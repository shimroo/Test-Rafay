private college experience. public college price.
a college degree is one of the best investments you can make in your future. a year ago, we took a bold step to lower tuition and make the cost of a college education more transparent. we let everyone know a bridgewater education is within reach. we got real about college costs, so more students would be able to access the real value of the bc experience. today, we remain committed to that accessibility and transparency in our pricing. learn more about what makes bc the best value for a private college education.
