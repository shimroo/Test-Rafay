infographic design for internet marketing

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 




the internet is about media, and if you are an internet marketing company that doesn’t have a graphic designer on your team, you better start re-thinking strategies this year. audio and video are the most engaging pieces of content on the internet, and businesses should be using them to push content across all forms of social media. but one of the most engaging and sharable pieces of content are infographics. educational infographics that are of value to consumers and business are easy to share and can generate engagement from social media, and email campaigns. understanding the importance of these infographics might entice you to make some of your own. so how do you do it, and what kind of infographics should you design for your business?
figuring out what infographics are right for your business shouldn’t be very hard, but getting the actual piece of content made by an infographic expert or graphic designer might be the most significant barrier to entry for any business. for content, companies should be producing infographics that are related to their industry, infographics of value, that consumers or other companies can reference and get value out of. 

if you own an automotive repair shop, you should consider an infographic that showcases things to pay attention to if your tires are wearing down. maybe you would want to make an infographic of all the warning lights that a vehicles dash assembly might have. low tire pressure, bad batteries, low oil, low gas, transmission problems, and anything else that is normal for automobiles to showcase if you operate a doctors office in plano, texas, you might want to share a seasonal infographic that showcases signs of allergies found in young children in the area. some states have particular seasonal allergies that can impact a child’s health, creating a shareable diagram that highlights signs of these allergic reactions could become a very sharable piece of content. 
if you don’t have an in-house graphic designer, or you have never created a graphic before, what program should you use? well, the easy answer is photoshop, that is what we use here, and that is what this site is about. there are other options available, though if that learning curve is too much, or if the price of adobes products is too high. you can also outsource your graphic design work, jump on linkedin, and make connections with graphic designers, and it would take you no time to find a qualified graphics designer. 
there is also the option to outsource your graphic design work to another marketing agency. i know of a digital marketing agency in oklahoma that does everything from graphic design to app development. if the content is done right, it’s worth outsourcing to an agency that has experience doing this type of work. not all infographics go viral, nor are they all shareable. so getting it done right the first time is a great way to get a jump on the new year, save money, and have others sharing your content for you. 
things to consider when outsourcing: 
• what do you want this to look like • what is your message • is there a call to action • is there contact information visible • is the content recent and relevant 

considering simple things like these few points we listed will save you time and money as you try to get a jump on getting ahead of your competition. saving the designer time by providing them with accurate and concise information will make the job and relationship smoother. graphics are an integral part of any internet marketing plan, they belong on websites, in videos, social media feeds, and everywhere that visual engagement is taking place. imagery is easily shared on platforms like facebook, instagram, pinterest, and similar social networks. 
find a way to incorporate infographics and graphic design into your social media strategies today.

marketing with brand names and logos

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 





most marketing agencies that design logos understand the attention-grabbing value that a logo can bring to a business. brand recognition may be name recollection, but it’s also a visual identification of a product. there are many marketing agencies out there that use tools like the ipad and software like sketch for ipad to ink out designs for their clients. on the other hand, there are still designers using photoshop (also an adobe product) and laptop or desktop computers. if you are a designer, you have heard of photoshop, and you know all the great reasons why investing in the adobe suite of design tools is an excellent option. however, if you are a marketing agency that is just starting to scratch the surface on graphic design and brand building, you need to understand how efficient these tools are. not only will they save you time and money, but also so that you can get the most out of your software and design the best marketing media for your clients. 



logo recognition 
anyone that has been alive for at least four years knows what the nike swoosh logo is, such a simple, sleek, swoosh, and yet marketing genius. how can something so simple become such an iconic piece of sports branding? nike has sponsored and been a part of so many fantastic sporting events, and you can’t get the infamous swoosh out of your mind. that is what we call logo recognition. 

brand recognition 
if i asked my mom what godaddy was, she could tell me they are an internet company, and that’s about it. my sister, on the other hand, would say to you that godaddy is where you go to purchase domains. it’s a domain registrar. however, if i asked her what their logo was, she would not have a clue. the name has been marketed so much more than the logo, and the brand is recognized worldwide. they are a leading registrar and hosting solution. godaddy has taken advantage of its position online and has become a leading marketing agency behind the scene. they also offer seo services, web design, branding, hosting, and a slew of other marketing services. 
outsourcing your brand building 
there are marketing agencies out there that specialize in web and logo design, and outsourcing your marketing design projects isn’t a bad idea. you could try an outsourcing platform like fiverr or go with a marketing agency like beyond theory, which has a proven track record of building brands and making local businesses thrive. upwork is also an option if either of those other suggestions doesn’t work. 

deciding on software vs. outsourcing 
if you are a marketing agency and you are still deciding on which direction to go, let us tell you that there are benefits to both. having an in-house graphic designer will help you with web design, flyers, brochures, and any other design media you need for your marketing and advertising projects. when times are slow, though, you need to deal with the downtime, and that’s never fun, especially if your graphic designer doesn’t know any other skill sets. finding a multi-talented graphic designer and web developer would be ideal, but if that’s not an option yet, you should consider outsourcing your projects.

designing marketing flyers

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 



creating marketing flyers in photoshop

marketing flyers were once something that were designed and printed to hand out at events or be used as mailers. marketing flyers have always been useful for promoting events and are still actively being used to market products and events and drive awareness in local markets. the effectiveness of these marketing flyers is dependent on the design work and how engaging the graphics and the call to action is. creating flyers that people will take, read, and respond to is an art that has long been the work of experienced graphic designers. the call to action is often minimal, it might be a date, a phone number, or even a website address to visit. they can all be incorporated into the design of the flyer to give users multiple means of contact. here is a step by step instructional for creating a basic flyer in photoshop. while this version of photoshop may be dated, it still applies to the newer versions and creative cloud. recently we have sub contracted all of our design work for marketing to an agency in oklahoma city called beyond theory. they have graphic designers on staff that specialize in the design of digital marketing flyers. these tutorials below are for the diy marketing agency or individual that doesn’t outsource their graphic design.
 
those steps in the video are a great foundation for building your first marketing flyer. there are going to be different menu options in this process depending on the version of photoshop you are using. for the most part though, the deign process will remain the same from version to version. there are other opinions to the design process and the formatting of the flyer. none are wrong as long as they convert. understanding your audience as with any other marketing channel will be important for the success of the campaign. here is another perspective from a graphic designer for a simple flyer design in photoshop cs6. while this version of photoshop may be outdated, the concepts still apply and this video is still valuable to anyone wanting to learn how to create a flyer.
 
in that example we saw an example of a flyer that was designed more like a document and less like a flyer. while a flyer can be anything really, we consider them to be more of the mailer style that you would associate with a postcard. the example above is a great example from a graphic designer that has experience and insight in the marketing world. designing marketing flyers for an agency can be a lucrative way to increase offers to existing clients looking to extend their reach to their audience.
below we have a video from creative tv. they offer another perspective into the eye of the designer and give photoshop artists som alternate perspectives in designing flyers for marketing. watch the video below and leave any questions you have in the comments section so we can answer any design questions you may have. you can view more photoshop tutorials from our home page.

bed bug infestation from a horror movie

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 



 creating a bed bug infestation scene with adobe photoshop

many times during the post production process, still frames are edited and manipulated in photoshop to enhance a scene. as our readers know, photoshop is a well known image editing and creation software and not often associated with post production in film. one of our members was on a shoot for a project that took place in a run down hotel that looked similar to the bates motel. the production crew was able to stage most of the set to get the look and feel of the scene they were looking for. some things were not in the budget to have live on set and had to be created using cgi and photoshopped frames. according to film producer richard ryan, the scene they were trying to capture was right out of a horror movie and took place in a run down motel room infested with roaches, bed bugs, and rats. even though the motel had been abandoned for years, they had maintained the property to convert it into a tourists attraction. they didn’t have any animal handlers on staff to provide and manage any critters on set, so they turned to cgi and photoshop in post production to finish the scenes. the roaches and rats were done with cgi software and imported into the scene using adobe premier. because of their size and rather immobile presence in the scene, the bed bugs were added in on a frame by frame basis using photoshop. apparently the scene they created was so creepy that the viewers squirmed at the site of the bed bug infestation. the part in the movie had the main actor searching the room for a bag of stolen money that was hidden there. when the actor lifted up the mattress to reveal the money hidden under it he was encountered by a infestation of bed bugs swarming the stolen money. at that point he had to make the decision to either leave the money or reach into the swarm of bed bugs and retrieve the stolen cash. as any good criminal would do, the actor reaches for the money and immediately becomes covered in blood sucking bed bugs. after hearing screams inside from his partner in crime, his jerry curled partner rushes in to find his friend crawling with bed bugs. he runs back out to the car to retrieve a can of hair spray and a lighter, only to return and perform some bed bug infestation removal of his own. after raising the can and lighting his zippo lighter, the crazed partner turns the entire motel room into a blazing inferno, burning the cash, the bed bugs, and his criminal partner. the movie has had some laughable reviews, and should be considered a b movie at most upon it’s release. the point of this article was not to showcase the movie itself, but rather the idea that photoshop can be used in film when editing single frames in post production. our guess is that eventually adobe premier will adopt that technology and that editing process will take place right inside of the video editing application. if you do end catching the movie at a b-movie theatre, be carful that you aren’t attacked by bed bugs like this woman was in a movie theatre in glendale, arizona!!

photoshopping health and fitness photos

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 



 the over photoshopped health and fitness industry
lately we have seen a ridiculous amount of photoshopped fitness photos showing the before and after results of various supplements and workout programs. we have been reaching messages through our facebook group asking us to expose the frauds and show our users how to touch up fitness photos for their clients. many of our users are web designers and internet marketers that use imagery to sell products and services, this means that you better be up to speed on your photoshop skills if you’re gonna be pumping out instagram content for your fitness clients. there was a local gym that had a personal trainer that was being followed by about 10k people. the guy was a legitimate personal trainer, but the before and after pictures showcasing the results were clearly photoshopped. to the untrained eye you may not notice the details we do when examining images. the supplement industry and the health and fitness industry is saturated with unrealistic claims of natural gains and growth. if you have been around either industry long enough you know what we are talking about. photoshop has literally made people millions of dollars from the artificial enhancements users can generate with images. there is a ton of skill involved here, this aren’t overnight photoshop editors, these people are legit. 
so how do you go about creating the perfect body in photoshop? here are a few video tutorials we found that you will find interesting. take a look and try applying some of these techniques yourself.

here is a great example of a photoshopped fitness picture.

 
the problem we have with editors in this industry is that they are using photoshop to create unrealistic expectations for young people. this causes people to create self-consumed complexes and can even cause depression among individuals trying to achieve the unachievable. if most people knew how heavily photoshopped the images on instagram where they would never feel this way, but that is the world we are living in. people and brand use modified images to inflate value, inflate results and cause a sense of delusion among consumers.
while we wanted to share some photoshop videos that showcased the artistry behind the touch up of health and fitness models, we are against the machine that uses them to promote products and services that are not capable of providing the implied results these images represent. photoshop is an amazing tool, using it to fool people into buying your products so that you can maximize profits is absurd.

retouching cars in photoshop

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 



 cleaning cars on a digital canvas
we had a client submit some material for us to make some flyers with. the flyers were going to advertise an upcoming classic car show. as we scrolled through the content that was submitted we quickly realized that the cars were lacking some shine. none of them had been cleaned prior to the pictures being taken, and none of them looked worthy of being plastered on the front of an advertising flyer. now whoever took those pictures should have gotten some car detailing tips from these guys, because it was obvious that the vehicle had not been detailed prior to the pictures being taken. so that leaves us with the question, how do we fix this in post production? how do we quickly take pictures of cars that don’t sparkle and give them that photoshop makeover so they are ready to advertise and promote the events the customer wants them too? well, there are some very simple photos techniques that can be used to add detail to a car photo, and there are tools to mask blemishes and remove unwanted dents and background noise. most of these processes are universal across photoshop, but with a car there are a few quick and easy things you can do and i am going to let scott kelby take the wheel on this one. i was browsing through youtube videos to see what the other guys were doing that had a little more photoshop experience with cars than i do and i came across his blog that featured this great video. take a look at the video, and leave scott a comment if you find his video to be valuable for you and your project.
 
if you enjoyed the video and found it to be helpful, be sure to jump on over to scotts channel to like and subscribe to his channel. there are many other great photoshop tutorials online and here at photoshoptutorials.us . if you need something that you can’t find on the site just message us and we will either create it for you or find some content that has already been created that you can use as a learning resource. thank you for visiting our site.

barber shop logos

by denise thompson ⋅  featured 



creating a logo for a barbershop

there has been a recent surge in barbershops opening around denver colorado and we have taken notice of these powerful logos making a statement online. most of our clients come to us requesting something elaborate, however, our graphic designers would opt for a more simple design like this logo from frank’s if they had the opportunity to create a logo for a barber shop. when i think of  a barber shop i think of clippers, razors, chairs, top hats, beards, and an old school four chair shop in the city. the new shops that are surfacing around denver appear to be adopting the old school barber shop look and feel. some of them are offering drinks and cigars and making the experience more of a gentlemen’s experience. so what makes a logo work for something like a gentlemen’s barbershop? in my opinion simplicity is always best, and what frank’s barbershop in denver did is the perfect example. the services offered from shop to shop are pretty universal, hair cuts, beard trimmings, straight razor shavings, and other male grooming services that will differ depending on the guys behind the chairs. franks is considered the best barber shop in denver, and this logo that was most likely designed using photoshop is representing them well, just check the windows on the building where it is proudly displayed.
creating the franks barbershop denver logo
as a graphic designer, i am curious what went into the design process from the artists perspective. we have to imagine that there were design concepts that were conceptualized and submitted by the marketing team or direct from the owners. it could have been an exact match of what we see, or it could have had some additional aspects to it that we are unaware of. however this logo came to be, both the graphic artist behind the design and the ownership that approved of it should be applauded for their decision making. the logo is simple, yet elegant, and screams sophistication from an era that has long past. the days when gentlemen roamed the sidewalks of downtown denver with top hats, pin stripe suits, and were polite to the ladies that walked by. this logo design reminds me of that era, and when i visited the website and had a look at the interior, the vision was complete. personally, i’m not sure if they could have conceptualized a logo that could have made a statement any better than this one does. it tells a story, it’s simple, but yet very complex and compelling.
creating designs like this using photoshop is quite simple. there are third party plugins that allow you to take pictures and filter them into silhouettes. there is also the option to draw these types of logos out by hand using a sketch pad. if i were to design a very simple mustache that i thought would represent the demographic franks was wanting to target, i’m not sure i would have done anything different. the execution is perfect, simple design, and a clear message. something like this could be designed with some of the basic features in photoshop to create it and exported it with a transparent background as a .png file. they have been using the logo in all their print and media both online and offline.
simple logos big results
sometimes simplicity is best, both for you as a photoshop designer, but also for the client that hired you. often then perception of a complicated logo design is what many business owners have in mind when reaching out to a graphic designer for work. it’s always easier to make adjustments when your logo design is simple. i think simple designs also tend to get remembered more than complicated designs. the brain just processes them better. this is a good example of a very simple design that has been effective for a business. these simple logos also print very well on things like leather aprons and leather barber rolls for tools.

mistakes that affect your physical business premises every day

by denise thompson 



 your business premises are much more than the concrete and cement building; they show your brand, values, and professionalism. most business owners make mistakes day in and day out that might significantly affect operations, customer experience, and even the bottom line. often, these mistakes remain unseen, yet the damage has been done. below, we discuss some of the most common and costly errors and how to avoid them.
neglecting regular maintenance
the biggest mistake any business can make is not keeping on top of routine maintenance. whether it is faulty machinery or the appearance of cracks on the floor, tiny issues can turn out to be time-consuming repairs or unsafe for a smooth operation. improper maintenance of hvac systems can lead to unpleasant workspaces and security breaches, while negligence in garage door repair in davie, florida, can result in operational inefficiency. always schedule routine inspections and tackle problems immediately before they grow out of proportion.
overlooking the importance of cleanliness
cleanliness helps maintain a firm’s reputation and the health conditions of its employees. regular cleaning schedules and outsourcing of professional services can help maintain cleanliness and avoid potential issues that may affect customer satisfaction.
poor lighting choices
lighting is crucial for your business’s ambiance. invest in energy-efficient lighting for your premises to enhance safety and aesthetics, especially in entrances, hallways, and display areas. this will prevent accidents and make the premises more inviting.
ignoring security measures
security is indeed very important for any business. many establishments have utterly incompetent security features installed. for example, an alarm system from some years ago will not serve you well. broken locks, unlocked access points, and lax security practices expose business property to risks. regular audits and updates of outdated systems ensure property safety and prevent potential burglary or vandalism.
failing to prioritize parking and accessibility
convenience means everything to customers and employees alike. inadequate parking or poor accessibility can deter potential customers, potentially damaging a business’s reputation and causing legal issues. improving parking facilities ensures smooth, well-lit, and convenient parking, complying with regulations, and promoting inclusivity.
underestimating first impressions
first impressions are crucial for businesses, and poor signage, paint, or landscaping can make a business appear stale or unprofessional, potentially forming customers’ opinions before they even enter. give the exterior of your premises a routine once-over and update it so that it doesn’t get stale. a well-kept storefront may make a big difference in foot traffic and customer trust.
overcomplicating interior layouts
a cluttered or confusing interior layout can frustrate customers and hurt sales. if the aisles are narrow or the signs are not very readable, guests may leave your place without purchasing anything. make simplicity the priority in organizing your interior: products should be easily found, the paths to them clearly viewed, and the signs visible. a well-designed space enhances customer satisfaction and makes employees more productive. 
your business premises are vital to business success. eliminating the most common mistakes, like lack of maintenance, cleanliness, and accessibility, would make the environment safer and more appealing for customers and employees. small changes you make in managing and caring for your space will have drastic effects. don’t let simple errors hurt your business; take action today!

how to use photoshop for effective brand marketing

by denise thompson 



 every successful brand has a remarkable story; the graphics become its language. adobe photoshop is believed to be one powerful weapon in graphic design where marketers create stunning visuals to captivate audiences and reinforce brand identity. 
discover how to harness photoshop to elevate your brand marketing strategy in this guide.
mastering the basics of photoshop
before you are ready to learn some advanced techniques, get to know the basic tools of photoshop. first, there are layers. you will want to learn about layers, as they can be used to create highly complicated images without changing the original photo. master the use of selection tools like magic wand and lasso to manipulate image parts, ensuring a polished and professional graphic.
creating consistent brand imagery
consistency in brand imagery lets you create a strong visual identity. you’ll design templates within photoshop for your marketing material, such as social media posts, email headers, promotional ads, and so on. your consistent use of color, font, and style makes your brand instantly recognizable. use the color palette tool in photoshop to extract and save colors so that your branded colors will be consistent on every platform.
advanced editing techniques
start with basic photoshop skills, then explore advanced features like clone stamp, liquify, blending modes, and filters for seamless, visually appealing images, and learn to use blending modes for depth and texture.
incorporating text effectively
text is an important factor in brand marketing. you can achieve various text manipulation abilities and effects through photoshop to make your message pop. use the text tool to add headlines and calls to action. add style layers like shadows, emboss, or glow-over text to your text for easy readability and make frames pop. smart placement can enhance the effect. 
creating eye-catching social media graphics
social media is one of the most important channels for brand marketing these days. luckily, photoshop allows you to create personalized graphics that really pop and stimulate activity. take this software to the next level by creating unique instagram stories, facebook posts, and youtube thumbnails. you can also use photoshop to edit videos to make short animations or gifs that enhance one’s social media presence.
optimizing visual content for different platforms
various platforms have different sizes, and image formats can differ. photoshop can resize and export images to those criteria so your visuals look their best everywhere. export allows you to save images in various formats, from jpeg for web use to png for transparent backgrounds. such flexibility means your marketing materials will look great and be effective across all channels.
integrating photoshop with other marketing tools
photoshop can be a real friend, especially when used with other marketing tools. for example, you can use it alongside your youtube placement exclusion list to create targeting-specific imagery for that audience segment. integrating photoshop with other creative tools, like adobe illustrator or video editing software, really enhances your power to make comprehensive and targeted campaigns.
photoshop isn’t just about editing; it’s opening a window to creating your dramatic brand story. its full potential lets you do this with ease and certainty-creating visuals that will strike a chord with your audience and further fortify your brand’s presence. begin now by harnessing the power of photoshop and watch your brand’s imagery become one of its most powerful marketing assets.

how to use photoshop to design your next hairstyle

by denise thompson 



 imagine having a magical tool that enables you to transform your hair without any risk. picture yourself experimenting with numerous hairstyles, colors, and textures as easily as flipping through a magazine. welcome to the avant-garde world of digital hairstyling with photoshop,     a cutting-edge solution for your next style revolution.
the dichotomy: traditional visualization vs. digital experimentation
the typical route in envisaging a hair makeover often includes tangible swatches, mood boards, or placing faith in your stylist’s vision. despite possessing some worth, these approaches harbor certain restrictions. static swatches are unable to portray the vivacity of flowing hair, and one-size-fits all mood boards might not convincingly depict how a style suits your unique visage.
the game-changer is a digital marvel called photoshop
packed with sophisticated features, photoshop catapults you into a realm of immersive and risk-averse hairstyle experimentation. simply upload your photo and toy around with an array   of tools to virtually test various cuts, colors, and textures. ever wondered how you’d look with    a punky mohawk, chic bob, or a cute pixie cut? photoshop lets you visualize these styles with astounding realism. if you see one you like, you can then get frank’s hair styling products and achieve that goal.
boons of embracing the digital route:

 unrisked experimentation: preview your new style before making a single snip.
 tailored customization: craft every minute detail of your look, from hair length to color and highlights.
 seamless versatility: play with multiple styles in one go, saving valuable time and effort.

disrupting the norm: democratizing creativity in personal style
one of the path-breaking boons of employing photoshop for hairstyle design is the democratization of creativity. in days of yore, manifesting a unique hairstyle demanded visiting  a high-end salon and relying on an inventive stylist. now, user-friendly design software like photoshop hands you the reins of creative control.
no matter your proficiency, photoshop’s intuitive interface invites you to probe and refine your personal style. with readily available online tutorials, mastering the software’s comprehensive toolkit becomes a breeze. whether you’re a beauty aficionado or someone eager for radical change, photoshop paves the way to a personalized look that mirrors your individuality.
why it matters:

 accessibility: design software is becoming tremendously affordable and user-friendly.
 empowerment: craft your own style narrative.
 inclusivity: photoshop’s potential is free for all, making personal style exploration a universal pursuit.

unlock the hairstyle you adore
ultimately, your hairstyle should embody your personality. photoshop becomes your virtual playground to explore different looks until you finally stumble upon the one that ignites your confidence and happiness. it’s less about succumbing to trends and more about uncovering a style that resonates with you.
here’s how to delve in:

 upload a sharp, high-resolution photo of yourself for the best outcomes.
 familiarize yourself with the tools. use the ‘lasso’ tool to outline your current hair, then experiment with ‘layers’ to simulate different styles.
 play around with color adjustment tools to see how varied shades and highlights enhance your look.
 finally, once you’ve discovered a style you’re smitten with, save the image to show your stylist and prepare for a real-life transformation.

5 best strategies for growing your business through digital marketing

by denise thompson 



 businesses are constantly seeking effective strategies to expand their reach and drive growth. digital marketing has emerged as a powerful tool for achieving these goals, offering a wide array of techniques to connect with customers and increase brand visibility. if you’re looking to grow your business, here are five of the best strategies for leveraging digital marketing to your advantage.
develop a strong social media presence
social media platforms have become the cornerstone of modern marketing strategies. with billions of active users, these platforms offer an unparalleled opportunity to engage with your target audience and build brand awareness. create profiles on relevant social media channels such as facebook, instagram, twitter, and linkedin, and regularly post high-quality content that resonates with your audience. foster meaningful interactions by responding to comments, messages, and reviews promptly. additionally, consider running paid advertising campaigns on social media to reach a wider audience and drive conversions.
optimize your website for search engines
search engine optimization (seo) is a crucial component of any successful digital marketing strategy. by optimizing your website, you can improve its visibility in search engine results pages, driving organic traffic and increasing your chances of converting visitors into customers. conduct thorough keyword research to identify the terms and phrases your target audience is using to search for products or services like yours. integrate these keywords strategically into your website’s content, meta tags, headings, and urls. additionally, focus on creating high-quality, informative, and engaging content that keeps visitors coming back for more. if you need help, contact an seo agency in west palm beach.
utilize email marketing campaigns
email marketing remains one of the most effective and cost-efficient ways to nurture leads and drive conversions. build an email list by offering valuable incentives such as exclusive discounts, informative newsletters, or free downloadable resources. segment your email list based on customer preferences and behaviors to deliver personalized content that resonates with each segment. craft compelling subject lines and engaging email copy to entice recipients to open and interact with your messages. don’t forget to optimize your emails for mobile devices, as an increasing number of people access their emails on smartphones and tablets. despite what you might hear, email marketing is still very much alive. 
leverage influencer marketing
influencer marketing has gained significant traction in recent years and continues to be a powerful strategy for growing businesses. identify influencers in your niche who have a substantial following and align with your brand values. collaborate with them to create sponsored content, such as product reviews, endorsements, or giveaways. the genuine enthusiasm and trust influencers have built with their audience can help you expand your reach, build credibility, and increase sales. however, ensure that you choose influencers whose audience aligns with your target market and that their engagement metrics demonstrate an active and engaged following. don’t make the mistake of partnering with the wrong influencers. 
create eye-catching graphics and images
visual content plays a pivotal role in digital marketing, capturing attention and conveying information quickly. utilizing professional graphics and images can significantly enhance your brand’s appeal and engagement levels. invest in graphic design tools like adobe photoshop (our favorite tool, after all!) to create visually stunning images, infographics, banners, and social media posts. be consistent with your brand’s visual identity, incorporating your logo, colors, and typography into your designs. eye-catching visuals not only attract attention but also leave a lasting impression on your audience, increasing brand recognition and recall.
it’s time to make your business stand out in the crowd – good luck!

search engine marketing made easy: guide to using sem effectively

by denise thompson 



 whenever you think of buying something, you’d first google the product you want. you might spend 45 seconds on a search page, and after that, you click through the first thing that attracts you the most. businesses use sem to display their products on top of the page, and it helps customers to find what they are seeking.
for many businesses, sem is all about investing in ads to get the product and services on top of search results. this will help them generate traffic and convert them into customers, resulting in brand success and high profit. in addition, you can hire experts from tempe seo services to make your sem strategy more efficient. but you must be unaware of how sem works. here’s a guide to help you, so continue reading to learn how to use sem effectively.
what is sem, and how does it work? 
sem or search engine marketing is a paid advertising strategy that helps in improving customers’ ability to find a product easily on search engines. sem traditionally referred to both organic and paid advertising, but now it only refers to paid advertising. the sem strategy is a simple process that entails the following:

keyword research: search ads target particular keywords which potential customers must be searching for. the first step of sem is conducting keyword research that would suit your brand. then you have to find out related words people will be searching for your product and services. for keyword research, you can also seek the help of companies like phoenix search engine marketing.
keyword cost: once you’ve narrowed it down to keywords for ranking, the next step is to consider the cost. the more competitive the keywords are, the more the cost will be for each keyword. google uses a quality score tool to determine your ad’s usefulness and relevance to the keywords you want. the closer the relevance is, the less your cpc (cost-per-click) will be.
sem targeting: sem becomes a powerful marketing strategy when it allows advertisers to specify their targeted audience for traffic generation. for example, you can target an audience by device, location, and certain times of the day. targeting an audience based on ideal customers effectively increases the chances of reaching the intended audience. that’s how you can make the most out of your advertising budget.
ad auction: to place an ad for your keywords in search engines, you must enter an ad auction for each keyword. google ads estimates ads by the quality score based on those keywords you want to bid on, and then you can propose your price. remember that the keywords must be valuable and relevant to your product and services.
