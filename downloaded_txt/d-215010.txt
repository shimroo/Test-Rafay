paraskavedekatriaphobia: the fear of friday the 13th. horror movie fans will have to wait until next year for the remake of the 1980 sean cunningham classic friday the 13th; fans and foes of the day itself have only one chance this year to either revel in its glory or hide from the world for twenty four hours. you see, today is friday the 13th. watch out.if we had planned things a bit better we'd be on our 13th mix this week, but we didn't. and hey, maybe we don't want that many thirteens all up in one post together. still, we won't let no stinkin' paraskavedekatriaphobia stop us from gettin' busy with ear farm's muxtape #12: twelve (muxtape doesn't allow thirteen!) songs dedicated both to the wonderful horror series, and to the unluckiest of days in the entire calendar. be careful out there!listen to this week's muxtape here. ear farm's muxtape #12: paraskavedekatriaphobia1.

"the past is a grotesque animal" by of montreal which clocks in at 11:53rome: 1992. we met in the garden. among daisies and lillies and bumble bees and fountains made of sculptures of adorable fat little child angels and dozens of loud american high school students on holiday; only a small portion of which were themselves fat little children. even with their ridiculously loud clothing, unconscionably loud mouths, and 'hopefully i won't get mugged' fanny packs, these were our peers. each of them was like us, but so much more obvious about their vexed malcontent. there you were with your public image ltd. t-shirt and belt buckle that screamed texas.  there i was with a hundred lines of poetry running through my mind and a camera pointed squarely in the face of each statue that came my way. statues are so much easier to photograph than people, and friendlier too. i turned away as you walked by the first time, still able to see enough of you to catch passions just like mine hidden behind your eyes. upon your second passing you caught enough of me to see i wasn't much more than a clown. i was in the middle of showing off my skills of imitation. your head whipped around, my friend laughed. it wasn't what i'd call the most ideal manner of making a first impression..."a dog?!" your face silently said."do it again dude," rob laughingly hushed as he hit my arm repeatedly. this had already been wowing him for a day and a half: i'd cover my mouth and bark a bit, off to the side, whenever some family of sharply dressed italians came our way.  the kids would spin around and tug at their parents' pants and excitedly proclaim something in italian. "ciao ciao fettuccine alfredo!" or something.  i didn't speak italian so everything sounded like an order at amedeo's to me. i'll admit it. it embarrassed me endlessly given how well i'd been managing with my french in paris. of course, equally embarrassing was the fact that i was a skinny american kid wearing a fanny pack. guess i forgot to mention that part - i too was one of the kids wearing a fanny pack. our teacher/chaperone was making all of us wear them in italy. "baaad pickpockets in rome... lots of gypsies," he kept saying. it was the first, and last, time in my life i've strapped on a fanny pack. and let me tell you, it dropped my already delicate self-confidence down about four notches. not to mention that i was in the middle of playing allen funt sans hidden camera for an audience of one. who am i kidding? audience of two. i enjoyed what i was doing as much as i hated it. and at that moment - lord knows why - i was hugely on top of my game. the summer of 1992 will forever remain the three month span in which i peaked as a michael winslow wannabe.  i covered my mouth, in what was surely the greatest single moment of my entire career as a ventriloquist voice fx guy, and let go of two well thrown barks..."rrrawgh, rrrrrawgh!"you saw where it came from this time. you were ready for it. you knew it was me and you marched right over to where i stood - even though the dog must've sounded like it was barking from some super-secret hiding place in the bushes far away. i mean, let's be clear about that. i was throwing my voice expertly and nothing but your amazing detective skills could've led you my way. right? my instigating friend rob turned swiftly and walked away laughing."oh my god, that was you?? do it again, again!" you exclaimed.i turned red and obliged. i was, and am still, a very reticent performer. this spur of the moment show wasn't what i'd call my preferred manner to try and woo the adorable tall girl from texas (with fine taste in music) who'd seemingly been placed in my presence by the gods. argh! what a mistake. i'd kill rob as soon as i could get away; however, at the moment i was caught performing my bark for the sizable houston contingent which you'd gathered around. thinking back, this was clearly the first sign that you liked the potential of "me" as much as i did you. i'm stuck wondering why i ever let go of my barking ability when it obviously worked so well with you.our t-shirts impressed each other and our heights were well aligned. that's pretty much all you need to fall in love at sixteen years old, and i think it helped my chances that i was barking so well when put on the spot. i ended up teaching three guys from your group just how i worked my magic, the magic with the barking. i never did tell them how i worked my magic with you.it was an unofficially school-organized trip for both of us.  our teachers had gotten together and booked trips for a group of their students to visit europe and do so in as educational a manner as possible. the two teachers that led our trip were my 10th grade history and english teachers. actually, they were my paideia teachers but that's another story for another time. point is, they constructed our itinerary around what they'd taught us in class, and it was pretty awesome. your group from texas was on a similar vacation; as fate would have it, my nerd-fueled itinerary would intersect with yours in rome.  there in the villa borghese gardens, in front the temple of asclepius, amidst the barking of (now) quite a few faux-canines. i spoke to one of my protégés about the girl i'd just met... "yeah man, of course i know her - we go to school together. duh. but look, you have to get in line. you and every guy in my school want to date her. she's brains and beauty. funny and smart and cute and hot! and rich too! good luck with that."some might say it was cupid's arrow, some the way our t-shirts collided. others would figure that my dog bark imitation skills made your heart skip a beat, or that our blue eyes locked once and never let go. at least one person in my group wondered why my attention was so easily caught by you rather than by her; and the same could be said about every guy who was traveling with you. what can i say? i fell in love with the first cute girl that i met who could appreciate oscar wilde and great music at a time when neither of us knew anything of love or life or pain or suffering. or rome. or great music, or oscar wilde really... standing on a rooftop in italy, alone with our misconceptions of de profundis and the ballad of reading gaol, it was a moment of perfection destined for nothing more than perpetual reflection. frozen in time.things could be different, but they're not. it's like we weren't made for this world; but i wouldn't really like to meet someone who was.august, 1992: rome. the past is a grotesquely distorted animal. even the apocalypse is fleeting.  there is no death in this ugly world and nothing can defeat you.  you're a monument in my mind and you haven't aged a bit in sixteen years.  yet i don't even remember your name, or what you looked like well enough to recognize you if we met tomorrow on the street.  but somewhere, there you are. still bringing the rain, still feeling wilde's pain.  sometimes i wonder if you've mythologized me like i have you.*above photo of the temple of asclepius in the villa borghese gardens from here.buy hissing fauna, are you the destroyer? on amazon.ear farm's 8+ is a weekly feature that showcases songs longer than 8 minutes.  in the recent past these songs were featured on ef's 8+:the controllers - "somebody's gotta win, somebody's gotta lose"islands - "bucky little wing"grandaddy - "he's simple, he's dumb, he's the pilot"broken social scene - "backyards"oingo boingo - "change"count basie - "blues for the barbecue"the besnard lakes - "you've got to want to be a star"m83 - "couleurs"to see a full list of every song featured in ear farm's 8+ click here.

band of the week: ratatat



band: ratatat (or ratatat depending on who you ask)from: brooklyn, nysound: imagine majestic melodic 8-bit video game soundtracks played in perfect intervals by eddie van halen and the ghost of duane allman    similar artists: daft punk, walter meego, hot chip, trans am, laromlablisten now: "mirando"much of the advance word surrounding ratatat's forthcoming lp3 (out july 8th on xl) has focused upon the record's incremental shift away from straightforward rock compositions in favor of a broader and more worldly sound.now if by worldly we're referring to "otherworldly", these reviews seem pretty fair. but the problem is that ratatat - the duo of multi-instrumentalist/programmer evan mast and guitarist mike stroud - have never really made traditional rock music to begin with, so any assessment of their evolution from 2004's self-titled debut through 2006's classics to lp3 has to keep this in mind. when you've already started with a wholly innovative take on the rock formula - symphonic movements the length of pop songs that utilize the electric guitar's brash melody in lieu of vocals - you can only go further down the rabbit hole. and this is exactly what the band accomplishes on lp3, not so much a dramatic reinvention but a logical exploration further into the nuances and contours of the world they've already created, splitting it open and shaking it up a bit....before, ratatat was the sound of cruising hot asphalt in a trans am with t-tops and playing contra in the basement of a parallel world. now, ratatat is the sound of hand claps spattered around sacrificial bonfires at the mouth of a volcano in a parallel world (while still playing contra). these are changes in atmosphere, changes prompted by mast's continued excellence at building pulsing sonic landscapes that bubble and gurgle with electronic bursts at exactly the most rewarding moment. these are changes that largely flow from the variation in percussive sounds and textures on the album, as mast has introduced a slightly more organic give and take to his beats and rhythms. this isn't to say that ratatat sounded cold and clinical before; one of the band's main strengths has always been in generating a warm fuzzy pulse to their electronic grooves. instead, it just suggests that they coaxed a bunch of ewoks into the catskills (where lp3 was recorded) to bang on soup cans, knotty tree roots, and whatever else they could find. tracks like "dura" display this trend perfectly, blending compressed drum samples with occasional bursts of clattering seashells, while others such as "mi viejo" favor layers of hand drums and what sounds like a combo of water droplets in a bucket and a deck of shuffled cards.the beauty of all this is that ratatat appears to have further tweaked a winning formula while maintaining what has been so immediately identifiable and transcendent about their music: stroud's guitar. that trademark wail, channeled and manipulated through god-knows-how-many analog and digital middle men, still commands the spotlight throughout much of the album. that's very much a good thing.and all of it - the extra-planetary funk, freshly organic click-clacking beats, glistening guitar lines, and throwback vibe to 1980s video game warfare (predator!) - is on display in this video for "mirando", the second single from the album. if you haven't seen it, you must; if you have, you must watch it again:pre-order lp3 herelisten:"mirando""shiller"see also:- vinyl triumphs over cds (again) + new ratatat- ratatat live videossee ratatat live:07 july - seattle, wa @ chop suey08 july - portland, or @ holocene10 july - san francisco, ca @ slim's12 july - los angeles, ca @ echoplex15 july - brooklyn, ny @ music hall of williamsburgvisit ratatat on myspace.--in the recent past, the following bands have been featured as ear farm's band of the week:steinskithese united stateskelley polarplants and animalsall the saintsi'm from barcelonabombadiltapes 'n tapessee the entire list of bands featured as ear farm's band of the week here.

'band' on the run: new iphone application



amidst news of the awesome (and affordable) new generation of iphones, it was something else entirely that caught our attention yesterday: band.the brainchild of moo cow music's mark terry, band is a new application for iphone that will allow users to compose original tunes on the go with the usage of a two-octave piano, guitar, bass guitar, drum kit, vinyl scratcher, and mixer via the phone's touchscreen. and according to a wired report on the new gadget:all instruments will be usable in the same song, while a multi-touch interface will allow up to five notes or samples to be played at the same time. animated keys and strings will appear to move when activated, and any part can be edited, erased or overdubbed. an included metronome keeps the beat to keep each part on time.check out the above demo video to see band in action; the initial edition should be available in a few weeks time, while future versions of the application will even allow users to create their own instruments. apologies to "books" and "reading", but it seems we may have found a new subway activity? listen: "band on the run" (foo fighters cover version)

chuck berry @ bb king's - 6 june 2008 (pictures, live video)



"i have no business running around on stage like a young boy... i'm eighty-one years old," chuck berry explained as he excused himself for launching into a signature duck walk during the song "school day." the passing of time clearly weighed heavily on his mind last friday night - he choked up mentioning the recent death of his good friend bo diddley on more than one occasion, and obviously felt as if he needed to apologize to the audience for time having finally caught up with him in regards to his ability to run, dance, jump, and duck walk around stage the way he used to. yes, the duck walk. and he can still pull it off. kind of. or, not really. but given the man's age, it was as rousing and impressive a feat as i could've imagined. here was one of the fathers of rock and roll - at eighty one years old - so caught up in the moment that he couldn't help himself. he was on fire, mid-solo, and it just happened. the audience erupted and he finished the song with a huge smile on his face. about a third of the show went just like this, a living legend living up to his name. the rest of the show was partially uneven, out of tune, and aged. however, the spirit of chuck berry carried the night handily; most memorably, as he caught himself repeating a song mid-set and then admitted that he'd forgotten what he was playing... (pictures and live video after the jump)above: chuck berry @ bb king's slideshowberry had just finished a medley of hits (including a rocking version of "roll over beethoven") while showing a hint of difficulty remembering the lyrics to one song. he paused briefly before beginning "my ding-a-ling" to reassure the audience that he'd "remember the words to this one." indeed, he did. however, after leading the crowd through the song he went right into "roll over beethoven" - again. an air of unease settled over the room as everyone but chuck realized immediately that we'd just heard "roll over beethoven." within measures berry realized what he'd done and stopped mid-song. "i actually forgot what i was playing... i'll admit it!" he confessed, "politicians oughta do that - admit it!" his handling of the moment brought levity and refreshing honesty to what could've been a miniature disaster. instead, he went right into "brown eyed handsome man" without pause. you can see the whole thing for yourself below.for the final two songs of the night, chuck invited "six young ladies" to join him on stage. the "six" ended up being closer to fifteen or twenty women, and they brought chuck berry right back to late-'50s form... rocking, rolling, dancing, and strutting around the stage. he even ventured out into the audience while rocking out before departing to a standing ovation with his impromptu entourage of twenty screaming female fans in tow. the concert was one third amazing, one third showing signs of old age, and one third pure entertainment. no matter how you slice it, a living legend.hail! hail! rock 'n' roll.*above slideshow created with admarket's flickrslidr.listen:"memphis, tennessee""school day (ring ring goes the bell)"watch:"my ding-a-ling" into "roll over beethoven" into "brown eyed handsome man" (live, from this show)visit chuck berry on myspace.

the naked hearts @ club rehab - 4 june 2008



the naked hearts kicked off their june residency at club rehab on wednesday night, delivering a smoldering set of taut, melancholic tracks.projected shifting patterns provided the only illumination onstage and emphasized the spare, dark qualities of the band's material. and it was great to hear these songs, previously confined to the intimate but limited confines of a 4-track recording, come to life and pop with an urgent swagger in the live setting. even better was the handful of other standout tracks i had yet to hear (and that hopefully will all make it onto the band's forthcoming debut album). the hearts check into rehab for the next two consecutive wednesdays so be sure to check them out; in the meantime check out more pics after the jump...listen:"mass hysteria" see the naked hearts live:11 jun - new york, ny @ rehab w/ susu and so l’il18 jun - new york, ny @ rehab  18 2008  9:00p21 jun - brooklyn, ny @ make music ny festival 24 jun - brooklyn, ny @ zebulon w/ so li’l visit the naked hearts on myspace
