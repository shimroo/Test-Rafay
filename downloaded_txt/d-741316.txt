legacy
it was 1902 when a young italian immigrant named giovanni amato first sold his real italian sandwich on the fishing docks of portland, maine. we’ve been keeping his legacy alive with every bite since.








quality
you don’t create a food legacy without quality. we don’t offer fast food, we offer prepared food cooked with pride and without cutting corners. quick take out, yes. fast food, never.








ingredients
giovanni used only real, high-grade products in 1902, and that’s what we use now. we choose fresh, quality ingredients for all our food.








bakery
amato’s bakery uses the best of the best – king arthur special patent flour. never bleached, never bromated.
