jupina!  (cawy)

a short google search has taught me that cawy is like the south american coca cola.  also that jupina is one of the sweetest drinks in the world.  a taste of this soda could tell you the latter.  this has sugar and corn syrup.  it's regular american super sweet, blended with sugar sweet, and somehow, after you swallow, it tastes like splenda.  i have no idea how.it tastes like fake pineapple and there is a little bit of vanilla/coconut (sun tan lotion) there at the end.  this website suggests you drink it with something salty or fatty.  as those are two of my favorite food groups, i thought i would like this, but alas, it was still way too sweet, though i ate it with homemade (read salt and oil) tofu croutons.  yeah, they're my experiment, but they were awesome, but they left me parched.  jupina is the opposite of refreshing.  it's like syrup.  bleh.  i am pouring this one out before bees attack me.in other news, i am excited about the new imbibe magazine from portland, or!  i am looking forward to a review of new deal vodka which is also from portland, but i can't get my hands on any!

solo orange soda

i got this norwegian soda in st. louis.  it's halfway between orange soda and orangina.  i would say there is actual juice in it, but i can't figure that out, since i don't read norweigan.  i got it in a can, but it was pretty tasty.

old jamaican ginger beer

so it turns out that ting has a sibling and it's old jamaican ginger beer.  real sugar!  that was pretty much the hallmark of this soda.  sweet, and very clearly sugary aftertaste.  it's very gingery and a little hot, but pretty unoffensive.  very natural ginger flavor.  good.the thing that was odd about this soda is its confused heritage.  it's called old jamaica, and that made me assume the country of jamaica.  especially since ting also claims jamaican heritage.  but the bottle says jamaica, wi.  wisconsin?  i am pretty sure jamaica, wi has no grapefruits, which is essential to ting.  then i realized it meant jamaica, west indies.  ahhhh that makes more sense.  but then, in large letters, product of canada!  huh?  it also proudly non-alcoholic.  i guess with the whole "beer" thing they had to clear it up.i do enjoy on their website that they have a beverage called mauby fizzz.  i want to drink something with many zzzzzzzs.

avery maharaja imperial ipa

avery maharaja imperial ipais great.so good.i am at a loss for words.it comes in a large bottle and is only available in the summer, supposedly, but i got it a couple of months ago.  it was on the recommendation of the guy at my local liquor store who ran the tasting.  i have been awaiting some righteous occasion to drink it, yet it was the only beer left in my fridge, which i felt was pretty righteous an event.it's very thick and creamy.  big creamy head.  i assumed this would be super hoppy, but it isn't.  it does have the sweetness of a dogfish 90 min.  pretty bitter aftertaste.  wondiferous.  it's almost a very hoppy creamy red.it even inspired this man to want to marry the avery brewery.  it's 9.9% alcohol and you feel it right away.  it's part of the avery dictator series, which i have not tried much of.also, note, avery has numbers in the titles of the web pages for its beers.  the number being 303.440.4324.  i first thought this might be a dewey decimal classification as i could only read 303.44 in my browser window.  i think on second thought it is not, but 303 is the number for social processes including some revolution, which only makes me love avery more!

ting!

ting!  it's such a great name!  it's also pretty good.  it claims to be "a little island sunshine in a bottle!"  well it is.  it's 6% jamaican grapefruit juice.  i didn't even know jamaica had grapefruits.  but it's tasty.  it's like fresca but sweeter (as it isn't diet) and also tastes more like real juice.ting!i bought it at an international foods store in st. louis.  ting!
