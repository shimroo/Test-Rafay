                  when i eat bbq, everything pretty much just serves as a vehicle for sauce to mouth. even so, i had a hankering for beef ribs so my boyfriend and i got an order of beefy ribs and classic pork ribs to split. wow. amazing. i loved the fatty, fall-off the bone beefy ribs while he enjoyed the smoky flavor of the pork ribs...review by - yelp

                  best bbq i've had! the portion sizes are huge so i recommend you come with an appetite and with a lot of time because the line can get really long! if you can't decide between beef ribs or pork ribs....go with pork!! the chicken is another favorite of mine, with their bbq sauce on top tri tip is also very delicious...review by - yelp

                  phil's bbq is truly a san diego staple. you come here, you gotta make a trip to phil's. obviously you have to get their ribs but the sides are not something to skip out on. their macaroni salad is like, mind blowing. it's a must! the french  fries with creole seasoning is amazing i'm drooling just thinking about it... stop reviews carousel play reviews carouselemail clubcorporate office3750 sports arena blvd. #6san diego, ca92110privacy policyterms and conditionsaccessibility statementfind us on...facebook pageinstagram pagetwitter pageyelp pagecontact usemailus@philsbbq.comthis website stores cookies on your computer; these cookies are used to collect information about how you interact with our website and allow us to remember you. we use this information to improve and customize your browsing experience and for analytics and metrics about our visitors both on this website and other media. by continuing to use this website, you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with our policies. to find out more about the cookies we use, see our privacy policy.powered by: website design, social media marketing and email marketing provided by spothopper.
