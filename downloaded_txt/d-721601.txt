warning to counterfeiters

if novavision is requested to produce custom security products or branded packaging, we require proof to substantiate that you are authorized to purchase that product. we independently verify your contact information and legitimacy. if you are not authorized to purchase the product, your contact information may be provided to law enforcement authorities without further notice. novavision cooperates with all local, state, federal and international law enforcement agencies to catch and prosecute fraudulent purchases and counterfeiting.
counterfeiting is illegal and is defined as any attempt to copy an original with the intent to defraud. it is illegal to purchase a fake identification product, an unauthorized custom hologram, an unauthorized duplicate security label, or counterfeit packaging which uses a copyrighted brand name or logo. further, in the usa, legislation is pending to expand the criminal law so that federal prosecutors will have an easier time prosecuting counterfeiters that manufacture bogus product labels and packaging.
