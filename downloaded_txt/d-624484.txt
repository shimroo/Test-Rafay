          apache2 ubuntu default page
        





          it works!
        


                this is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the apache2 server after installation on ubuntu systems.
                it is based on the equivalent page on debian, from which the ubuntu apache
                packaging is derived.
                if you can read this page, it means that the apache http server installed at
                this site is working properly. you should replace this file (located at
                /var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your http server.
          

                if you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
                maintenance.
                if the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.
          



                configuration overview
        


                ubuntu's apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with ubuntu tools. the configuration system is
                fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/readme.debian.gz. refer to this for the full
                documentation. documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc
                package was installed on this server.

          

                the configuration layout for an apache2 web server installation on ubuntu systems is as follows:
          

/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
          


apache2.conf is the main configuration
                           file. it puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        

ports.conf is always included from the
                           main configuration file. it is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
                        

                           configuration files in the mods-enabled/,
                           conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
                        

                           they are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. these should be managed
                           by using our helpers
                           
a2enmod,
                                a2dismod,
                           

a2ensite,
                                a2dissite,
                            
                                and
                           
a2enconf,
                                a2disconf
. see their respective man pages for detailed information.
                        

                           the binary is called apache2. due to the use of
                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.
                           calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
                           default configuration.
                        




                document roots
        


                by default, ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to
                any file apart of those located in /var/www,
                public_html
                directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). if your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.
            

                the default ubuntu document root is /var/www/html. you
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. this is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.
            



                reporting problems
        


                please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                apache2 package with ubuntu. however, check existing
                bug reports before reporting a new bug.
          

                please report bugs specific to modules (such as php and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.
