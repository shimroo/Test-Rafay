our reputation speaks for itselfcheck out the testimonials on trip advisor, yelp and other internet sources, or ask your local dive shop or friends who have dived maui.we won’t have a good day if you don’t – let’s go diving!





























































ahola! i want to thank the captain and crew of the sea spirit for a fantastic experience diving at molokini at crater on december 28, 2013. this was the first dive i've taken without my own buddy in tow, so i was hoping to find at least one friendly diver on the boat. instead i found 3 crew that instantly felt like friends and a small group of fun loving divers who all stayed together safely as a group, guided by ricardo who pointed out all the interesting creatures below, from sea turtle to octopus. it was like a dream and i can't wait to return to maui for more diving. mahalo!! jennifer pandino







we dove with 3 different outfits in maui. all were very good, but yours was the best. the adventure-x trip on wednesdays was perfect. we dive a lot at home and prefer being around advanced divers. ed's crew handles dives perfectly: no rushing, maximum bottom time, safety. the backside of molokini was amazing. also, splitting the 2nd tank into two short dives was very considerate. other operations would have burned the entire tank at one location. we'll be back! jonathan







this is my third trip to maui and diving with ed robinson's diving adventures and i love it. i probably did anywhere between 50 and 60 dives with erda, molokini back and forth and along the east coast of maui knowing all the cool reefs, wrecks and 'secret' spots. not only i always enjoy the 'hang loose' characters of the dive masters and boat crew, no it's like meeting friends and almost family. been 'lured' to other dive ops around maui but keep bouncing back to erda. as an enthusiastic diver, photographer and videographer it's a great pleasure to go back to the sea diver and sea spirit every week. there is no better maui diving than with ed and his excellent crew. mahalo and mele kalikimaka. beat korner
