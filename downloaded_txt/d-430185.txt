  journeys of the heart
  this beautiful japanese calligraphy was created especially for esprit by shotei ibata, one of the many skilled artisans (sensei) we have had the pleasure of introducing our clients to in japan.  the english translation is ``journeys of the heart``, which truly fits what we seek to offer our clients.

throughout this website you will see this calligraphy used to bring attention to more than a millennium of japanese poetry.

    testimonials
     
  “
thank you for esprit - our visit to japan with esprit was better than anything i could have imagined--every minute opened another window of the world.  you can never know how enlightening the japan experience was.

  “
the thoughtful and creative manner in which you constructed each day, unfolded like the blossoms that i had come to see.  each interaction built on the one before it, as layer upon layers of experience that brought increasingly deeper understanding.  nothing was linear; everything was multi-faceted.  
  

ann m.



 
  “
while still basking in the warm glow of my tour experience, i just had to write to you to thank you and the entire staff at esprit travel for a truly mountaintop experience. as a maker and collector, this tour more than met my expectations and hopes.  esprit has made me hungry for more of japan - my spiritual home.
