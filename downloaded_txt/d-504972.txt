all of our gunstocks
 are unfinished, completely shaped 
and ready for sanding & finishing.

they come with either a 99% "press-fit" 
inlet which means that the action will bolt to the stock with mininimal fitting, or a   96% "semi" inlet 
which will require
additional handwork
to fit the action
and barrel.
 please see
"available actions" 
& 
"common questions" 
sections for details.
