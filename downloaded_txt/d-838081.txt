helping teachers help students











the
          tesl times is designed to be a resource center for esl teachers who are looking for helpful activities, material, and lesson plans based on a communicative/context-embedded integrated skills approach to language learning. think of this site as a repository of ideas and information. so, feel free to take what you like and think will work with you and your students.     
         


as the editor of the tesl times, i hope this site will prove useful. its content has been collected and developed over the past eighteen plus years teaching english for academic purposes to the students from around the world. i began this site while teaching at the university of florida in the year 2000, and have continued to add and update it as a teacher at the embry-riddle language institute. all this basically means that tesl times is always a work in progress, so if you have great ideas and materials to share, or questions about the content, please email me at: editor@tesltimes.org and maybe we can add your creativity too. 


thanks for visiting,
   douglas adams, editor.
