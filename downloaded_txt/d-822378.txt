our program



since 1963, the randolph school has been a beacon of progressive education here in the hudson valley.   our founders were parents and teachers, with a deep desire to reframe what childhood and education can look like.  drawing inspiration from earlier generations of progressive thinkers, randolph has grown over time into its own unique manifestation of living and learning.   -encouraged by loris malaguzzi and reggio emilia, here at randolph, teachers are learners alongside children.  this relationship is central to offering opportunities for constructivist, self-directed, hands-on learning.-guided by john dewey, we believe that children come to school to “do things and live in a community which gives them real, guided experiences and fosters their capacity to contribute to society.”   -informed by lev vygotsky, we know that when children are in the zone of proximal development for a given goal, balancing appropriate assistance and opportunities to practice fosters personal growth.  facilitating this experience is a strength of our teachers.
