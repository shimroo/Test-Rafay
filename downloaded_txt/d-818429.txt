who are we?











healthcare for all ohioans (span ohio) is a non-profit that has been championing universal healthcare in ohio for over 20 years. we focus on educating the public and supporting single-payer action network ohio, our allied 501(c)4 organization. our core mission is achieving healthcare reform in ohio and the united states, guaranteeing healthcare access for all residents.










exploring single-payer solutions











at healthcare for all ohioans, we advocate for achieving universal healthcare coverage in ohio and the united states. we believe a single-payer healthcare system offers the most effective path towards this goal.
what is a single-payer system?
a single-payer healthcare system provides comprehensive health insurance to all residents of a state, managed by a single public entity. this eliminates the need for private insurance companies. a single-payer healthcare system offers:

guaranteed coverage: everyone in ohio would be insured, regardless of employment status, health condition, or age.
reduced costs: by streamlining administration and negotiating lower drug prices, a single-payer system could decrease overall healthcare spending.
improved access: reduced costs means easier access to preventive care and specialists. you also have your choice of any provider - no more searching "in-network" providers.




























is single-payer right for ohio?
does ohio healthcare leave you stressed? you're not alone. many ohioans struggle with high costs, complex plans, and limited coverage.
there's a better way! we at healthcare for all ohioans believe a single-payer system offers the most comprehensive and efficient way to achieve universal healthcare.
a single-payer healthcare system would provide comprehensive coverage for everyone, including medical, vision, dental, and mental health services.
imagine:

no more sky-high premiums!
no surprise co-pays or deductibles!
financial security in the face of medical emergencies!

healthcare is a basic human right. everyone in ohio deserves access to quality, affordable care. join us in advocating for a single-payer healthcare system in our state and nationwide which would serve all ohioans. together, we can create a win-win situation for everyone - whether through legislation in our state or nationwide!
