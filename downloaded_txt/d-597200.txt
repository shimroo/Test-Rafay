one of the problems about learning english is that the sort of thing you find in textbooks or in class is usually "correct usage," whereas in real life you may think you know english -- but then you turn on your television set, read a newspaper or hear people talking and discover you only understand half of what's going on. the reason may be that you are reading and hearing idioms -- those colourful ways we have of expressing ourselves using words or groups of words that very often make no logical sense! the solution? idioms have to be learned, one by one...and idiom-magic is the fun way to do it! ___________________________________
