 new red star arms trigger is here! 
 








adjustable ak trigger system
ak trigger system 
patent no. us 6,772,548 b1 
 


  new redesigned red star arms/power custom ak trigger 


this trigger has been modified to fit most ak's without modifications.  the trigger has been widen, opened up in the rear to clear the trigger guard rivets. the adjustment screws have been moved slightly but, are basically in the same location.  some ak's may need the receiver window altered to allow the trigger to fit through the receiver hole so, it will move freely in the receiver (we have found the maadi's need this modification more then any other ak's out there but, it is possible for there to be others). please follow the sequence in the enclosed instructions.

the only 100% milled ak trigger group made in the usa. made the right way, from solid steel bar stock. before, the american shooter had to settle for cast or mim'd copies of the original parts, not anymore! rsa offers the first fully adjustable kalashnikov fire control system.

ak74 5.45x39 receiver flat top rail bent and trimmed
here is what mr. curtis says.to use these flats you will need to have a 5mm and 7mm reamer. this will help solve two of the problems with the flats currently on the market. in all there are at least five problems that will be fixed with these flats compared to any offered before.the rails that will come with the flats are pictured below. they have mag stabilizers on both rails to keep the mag from tilting and causing feed problems.

ak-builder flat bending die set
this is what mr. curtis says.the base of this die set is made from a solid piece of steel that starts off at 17lbs and is machined to 14.5lbs.  there is a radius at the entrance of the die which takes less pressure to make the bend.  in my testing i have bent several flats by just putting the ram in the middle of the punch and pressing the flat straight in without moving the ram down the length of the punch.

ak74 5.45 fixed stock receiver flats
the 5.45 ak74 flats are the same as my 7.62 flats except for the magwell opening is smaller to fit the 5.45 magazines. to use these flats you will need to have a 5mm and 7mm reamer. this will help solve two of the problems with the flats currently on the market. in all there are at least five problems that will be fixed with these flats compared to any offered before. the rails that will come with the flats have mag stabilizers on both rails to keep the mag from tilting and causing feed problems. the picture of the rails are from the actual samples and are made from 4130 steel. yes, i had samples made and tested them before shipping any flats. i bet no other company that sells flats ever went to that much trouble. these were designed from an actual receiver from romania then during the later runs of rails i switched to the longer length rail like the bulgarians used.
