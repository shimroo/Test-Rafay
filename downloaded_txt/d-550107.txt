pastoral support and careno matter who you are, or where you are on life’s journey, plymouth offers support through difficult times. if you or a loved one would appreciate pastoral connection, let us know by contacting our pastors.




    support and care
  


























open & affirming



plymouth church has been an open and affirming congregation since 1993. we embrace diversity and affirm the dignity and worth of every person created in the image of god. we honor the guiding principle that discrimination is incompatible with christ’s message of unconditional love.















stephen ministry



stephen ministers are lay congregation members trained to provide confidential, one-to-one care to those experiencing a difficult time in life. the dedicated stephen ministers at plymouth all share a passion for bringing god’s love and high-quality supportive care to people during a time of need.















justice & compassion



plymouth church has been on the forefront of social justice issues like gender equality, marriage equality, racial justice, and lgbtq+ rights. we are a just peace congregation, we affirm our intention to seek justice and peace in every sphere of life, and recognize there can be no true peace without justice for all.
