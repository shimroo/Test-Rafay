gotta love little boystwo young boys walked into a pharmacy one day, picked out a box of tampons and proceeded to the checkout counter.the man at the counter asked the older boy, 'son, how old are you?' eight,' the boy replied.the man continued, 'do you know what these are used for?'the boy replied, 'not exactly, but they aren't for me. they're for him. he's my brother. he's four. we saw on tv that if you use these you would be able to swim and ride a bike. right now, he can't do either!"i thought it was funny.

|dishwasher is running]please check it out.  this is not a candidate trying to sell you something.  this man has actually got a workable energy plan for america, and this daughter of the oilfield supports it.  i only wish i could buy a car that is fueled by natural gas now.  (even if the nearest station is 90 miles from me!)www.pickensplan.com

|pre-race report on speed]as i had hoped, tony is running with a. j.'s number next season.  the old spice/office depot sponsorship is kinda cool too.  old spice will forever remind me of my dad.  can't wait for the commercials with tony.  they'll probably be as dumb as the car wax one, but you gotta admit the car is fine!  something about a black corvette....oh yeah, if you don't speak nascarese, then the above paragraph will make no sense to you.  it's okay. *patpats*

|birds singing in the ash trees]i offer sincere thanks to everyone who sent a positive thought, energy or offered a prayer for me lately.  it's all working!  my health is much, much more stable.  emotions are still kinda off the wall, but the meds work when i let them, lol.  still no job, but that will come when the goddess wills it so.  and joshie.......i got my net back. i'm here for ya.  it's avalonde@gmail.com.  if you want the phone, let me know.  brynna, i'm available now.  any evening except tomorrow.  (i got a damned bridal shower tomorrow).  i freaking hate bridal showers, if it wasn't my niece..........again, thanks to everyone for the positive vibes.  you will never know how much it means to me.

|happy]...has been a very good day, and it's only 3 p.m.!  aubrey is in houston for a week, and i miss him (but the break is kinda nice, i always did love alone time).  earl flies out tomorrow for a 5-week reunion with his family of birth in pennsylvania.  kenny, cathy and zach left today for a week in albuquerque.  what is this lack of sound around me?  (besides two meowing kittens, the cockatiel, hedgehog and two dogs)  could this be....*gasps*....the sacred thing i remember as silence?  dear goddess, i believe it is!  now i can run around the house naked, cook what i want to eat (within the confines of a low sodium/low cholesterol/low taste diet), and go to bed when it damn well pleases me to do so!  omg, i can readdddddd and listen to loreena mckennitt all night long!  health update:  doing really, really good.  doctors are pleased.  oh, and somehow i picked up the worst case of athlete's feet i've ever had, and i raised many boys the last 30 years!  ah well, always gotta be a fly in the ointment.anyway, gotta run, got a job interview in a bit.  wish me luck!  i miss y'all!!!

|something from poc2]body: repeat in case you didn't see this on myspace, my email, etc.i can't sit up long tonight, but i wanted to share that i've been in and out of hospitals, intensive care units, and clinics for about the last 6 months. i'm doing some better, but they put me in the intensive care for chronic pancreaitis, while there, i suffered a pretty major stroke. we are waiting for the tests to see if i have pancreatic cancer, though the doctors really don't think i do, so that's a good beginning.as a result, my family won't let me drive for a while, i'm just recovering my gross motor skills, but my handwriting, vision, and pattern speech is not recovered yet. the doctor said it will, be patient.(does he even know me? ha, ha!)anyway, i've gotten all your emails, comments, phone calls and expressions of love. please be assured that rhonda loves you all just as much and is so thankful for your friendship and support. few of you have i told any of this to.in addition, while i was in the intensive care unit, wal~mart fired me. aubrey won't let me look for a job for a while, so i'm at my mom's for a short period of time, just letting her spoil me and feed me fresh from the garden veggies.no, i'm not separated from aubrey. in fact, he comes down every few nights to spend the night with me. my house in hobbs is chaos right now, that's why i'm in jal. kenny, his sweet gf cathy, and their son, zach lives with us as well as earl. unfortunately, zach screams about 12 hours a day, and i just couldn't heal in that atmosphere. earl was not working, so he's with me getting a taste of small town life. we are on the library computers which we can check every few days.brandon moved back to ohio, arrived safely last night, but you can imagine that did not help my depression any.i've rattled on more than i should, but i wanted to offer my meager explanation. now my cell phone doesn't work in jal, but mom's number is 575-395-3094 and my cell (when i get back to hobbs) is 575-691-6006.i love y'all and miss you .tia, mother rhonda, mom and the witch who is so very blessed to have so many supportive friends and family.
