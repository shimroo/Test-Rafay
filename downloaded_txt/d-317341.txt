what is old time radio??? old-time radio (otr), started in the early 1920s with the birth of commercial radio broadcasting and continued until the 1950s.
      in the united states, it was the primary form of entertainment in the home and was know as the golden age of radio.
radio was the first medium for broadcasting, and people frequently tuned in to their favorite radio shows.  in the e. hooper poll, radio listeners were found to be 82 out of 100 americans. for the new media, a number of new entertainment styles and genres were developed, many of which later migrated to television: radio plays, mystery serials, soap operas, quiz shows, talent shows, etc...

tv superseded radio as the most common television medium in the 1950s, and commercial radio content moved to broader news, talk, sports and music formats.
