i certainly would retain dave again with any future real estate transaction!


i've had the good luck to work with dave twice ... he sold me my first house (in depere) and 10 years later dave helped me sell the house when i had to move due to progressive disability. the house sold within days, i received an initial bid above the asking price, and i only had to make a decision now and then and sign papers. when the inspection took place i was disappointed because the cost was going to be great, but dave negotiated it down to a more reasonable amount. i certainly would retain dave again with any future real estate transaction!

this was the most pleasant, professional real estate experience i have ever had.


recently jane jadin helped my siblings and i sell our mother’s home. i’m here to report that this was the most pleasant, professional real estate experience i have ever had - and i’ve had a few! jane kept my 3 siblings and i informed every step of the way. her staging of our home was simply outstanding as was her style of interacting with both potential buyers and the 4 of us.

by the way, before we hired jane i was thinking that in a hot green bay real estate market, we could try and sell the home on our own - save ourselves some money. it really felt like properties were selling themselves. well i’m here to say that i’m so pleased we did not go solo in this effort. selling a property today has so many more layers than even 5 years ago…and having jane jadin in your corner is an incredibly valuable asset!

thank you jane for making this process painless.
