	 emery to be charged
	 
    


david mccann, a vancouver resident, plans to file charges against marc emery today "to prove a point." according to the globe & mail, "mr. mccann said he has hired prominent lawyer peter leask in filing three charges of conspiracy under the controlled drugs and substance act and the criminal code of canada."this is about sovereignty and hypocrisy," mccann is quoted as saying, "... every now and again i think canadians have to stand up and say to the government, "you're doing something wrong here.'"there is some chance that these charges, if accepted by a canadian court, will nullify the extradition of emery. this is because a canadian cannot be extradited when facing the same charges in his or her own country as in another country. sort of like double jeopardy in the u.s.here's hoping mccann's plan works.

	 dose interview
	 
    


check out this interview with marc emery. while there, take a look at the (totally unscientific but still interesting) poll asking what you think about the possible emery extradition. according to the results when i clicked it, 91.22 per cent were "sickened" by the possibility.now, sure, dose readers may be nutbags, but that's a pretty significant percentage of nutbags that think u.s. involvement in this case is "sickening."
