   ngpc culturedisciples making disciples  if you're looking for a church that makes no apology for being passionate about the gospel, you may want to visit us. if you're looking to learn more about that one weekend in jerusalem 2000 years ago where a jew was crucified on a thursday and rose again on sunday, then please join us; we know him well and worship him all the time. if you're looking for truth, you have come to the right place because we know the one who said, "i am the way, the truth, and the life..." if you're looking for a church that is not only committed to sharing the gospel but our very own lives in a deep and rich covenant community, we look forward to meeting you.at north, we believe we are called to live the great commandments as we go about the great commission - disciples making disciples. if you attend ngpc, it is expected that you will commit to growing in faith, love and service as we do mission together as his disciples.   what to expect if visiting ngpc  you'll be warmly welcomed and assisted when you arrive. your children are valued and along with everyone who attends, they will be addressed during the worship service. you won't be asked to do anything during the service or financially give to ngpc (there is no public collection of monies during the service). however, we do invite primary kids to come to the front for a kid's talk and song if they are comfortable doing so. the bible is read and explained and songs (mostly contemporary) are sung, and prayers are also offered. the worship service reflects our convictions about our sovereign and merciful god, who has revealed himself in the good news of jesus and has spoken to us all through the bible.      ngpc worship service 9.30 am every sunday   ngpc worship service 9.30 am
