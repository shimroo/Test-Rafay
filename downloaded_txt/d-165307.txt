our community

“i think we (aim) are very inclusive. when new people come in i think we do a good job of making sure they feel included and safe. it’s literally the least cliquey program i’ve ever been in, and i’ve been in a few. there has never been another participant who i felt like i couldn’t approach or talk to. i think i am going to have lasting friends from this community. this is the first place where i have felt comfortable enough to be really myself. this has to do with the work i’ve done here but also largely with the community i have found here” — past participant

our services

 

group, individual, and family therapywithout intentions, it's very difficult to set goals. therefore, we believe it's imperative to clearly realize and state our intentions. an intention may be as simple as time management; however, it is the foundation which paves the way for other goals to materialize.academic mentoring and access to academic institutionsparticipants overcome academic hurdles that developed when they were living a life lacking in congruence between intentions and actions. academic goals are self-driven, and participants maintain their own schedules as they establish themselves as leaders in the aim house community.



integrative psychiatry, relapse prevention and supportsetting and accomplishing personal goals is not easy when one has a history of sabotaging themselves with destructive behaviors. we come face-to-face with what's getting in the way of actualizing personal success.vocational coaching and creative internshipsparticipants spend time building a stronger support network outside of aim house as they gradually move into greater degrees of independence and responsibility. participants see the fruition of their hard work while under the support of an aim house mentors, their therapist, and the participant community.

what people are saying

 

how can we say “thank you” for… your comfort, your compassion, and your concern? how can we say “thank you” for… your honesty, support, and knowledge? how can we say “thank you” for being there with our son when we couldn’t? how can we say “thank you” for saving our son’s life?a simple “thank you” doesn’t seem enough and a thousand “thank you’s” don’t measure the extent of our appreciation. so please take comfort and pride in knowing that you touched a young man’s life, his parent’s hearts, and that the only words we can think of at this time to express our gratitude are simply, ”thank you.”— aim house parent

 

“thank you for creating a place where it’s okay to struggle. i learned an enormous amount about life while at aim house. you and your family made being away from–or at odds with–my family much more bearable. thanks for being a great friend and sounding board.”— aim house participant



“thank you all for providing our son with a wonderful experience and a ‘home-away-from-home’. this past nine months really proved to me just how far dave has come, and just how ready he is to take on adult responsibilities. i am looking forward to this father’s day in a way that i haven’t for many, many years.”— aim house parent

 

“we are grateful and appreciative to your program for helping us make this crucial transition and giving us skills to work through conflicts and to anticipate potential problems. we found the parent weekends extremely worthwhile educationally as well providing the valuable opportunity to meet other parents and participants. the staff has reached out like family in their commitment and genuine concern for our daughter. reflecting back, the past year was critical for our family and with the help of aim house, it was one of growth, and restoring relationships. our best regards to you and your staff for the work you do.”— aim house parent
