consulting services 














 




							cultivation						


						how you grow is highly dependent on the segment for which you are marketing to. fiber, grain, botanical extraction, and craft flower each have entirely different practices.					









 




							harvesting						


						what you will grow and therefore harvest has more to do with your operations than which markets you are interested in pursuing. we're here to help you succeed.					









 




							marketing						


						as with any new crop there will be plenty of speculators, and processors who have growing pains. we will assist you in not only having a contract in place, but a contingency plan.					









 




							processing						


						we will assist you in making informed decisions for equipment and business models based on the end market and level of vertical integration you want to achieve.
