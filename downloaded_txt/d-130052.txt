final weeks 
resilience: new ceramic works by terri kern
what does nature teach us about the ability to embrace, resist, or recover from life’s challenges? local ceramic artist terri kern explores the theme of resilience in her latest creations. inspired by the natural world, her symbolic works of art tell stories of love, loss, triumph, and hardship. kern also sought inspiration from a variety of objects in the taft museum of art’s collection, including chinese porcelains, italian maiolica, and european portrait miniatures.   
on view now through february 16, 2025.
