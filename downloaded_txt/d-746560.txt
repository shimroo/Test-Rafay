welcome to on the lake! 



since before i can remember, i have been in love with the outdoors. boats, motors, fishing and being either in or on the water are all at the very top of my list of things i want to do… as often as i possibly can.outdoor blood runs thick in our family. we all feel that a family vacation is still one of the best opportunities to reconnect with the ones who are most dear to you. for my recollections of those times, please read the finest of times.the natural beauty and serenity of the northwoods will provide an experience and memories that are hard to beat and will last a lifetime. the site is packed with lots of useful information, “how-to” articles and much more. whatever you seek, i hope that you can find it here, on the lake.

fishing since the age of eight.  seriously writing since the age of 16. chef and foodie from the age of 22 years… and counting. so much to learn and so little time. i have enjoyed every minute of it all.  whether on the water (where i like it best), in the kitchen, or at the keyboard, churning out content, i feel like i have found my place.  i am sharing it with you in the hope that some of what i love to do will rub off on you. i hope to see you on the lake!
