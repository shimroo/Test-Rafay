we are still glowing from the superlative concert you shared at trinity lutheran church in grand rapids while on your summer tour.  i continue to receive so many comments from those that attended your outstanding performance.  people were thrilled to have been there to hear such excellent singing by your choirs!  the repertoire that you shared was magnificent in its breadth, variety, tonal quality, and diction.
it was equally wonderful to witness how respectful, appreciative and disciplined the singers are!  i've also heard many people say how much they appreciated the handshakes at the end of the concert and how the singers went out of their way to thank people for attending.
it was an honor and pleasure to have you visit us in grand rapids and share your amazing musicianship with us.  we would be delighted to have you join us again for a future concert.
