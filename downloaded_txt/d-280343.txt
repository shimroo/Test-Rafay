china-africa space co-op shows tech’s multi-polarization, democratization trendsby global timesfeb 13, 2025 09:45 pmillustration: liu rui/gtin recent years, cooperation between china and africa in the space field has deepened. however, some western media outlets have tried to distort the nature of this cooperation. on tuesday, reuters reported that china is "building space alliances in africa to enhance its global surveillance network and advance its bid to become the world's dominant space power." the article also cited remarks from the pentagon, claiming that china's space projects in africa and other parts of the developing world are a "security risk."the real security risk is not cooperation or the sharing of technology, but the ideological prejudice of the west that clings to hegemony and obstructs progress. for a long time, space and other high-tech fields have been dominated by the us and its allies. behind the smear campaigns of western media lies the west's fear of china-africa cooperation. the cooperation between china and egypt in space technology, referred to by foreign media as "china's secretive overseas space program," has been open and transparent. public records show that egypt is the first country to carry out satellite cooperation with china under the framework of the belt and road initiative. at the end of 2023, the jointly designed and developed satellite misrsat-2 was successfully send into orbit. an egyptian space agency official said that the project has promoted the training of egyptian space professionals, helping egypt become a leader in the field of space satellites in africa and the middle east. this "teach a man to fish" approach is a key step for africa to achieve autonomous industrialization and modernization.western media's smear campaign against china-africa space cooperation ignores the legitimate need for african countries to develop space technology. space technology and monitoring systems can be used for weather monitoring, agricultural planning, environmental protection, and disaster management, helping africa address climate change, improve agricultural productivity, optimize resource management, and enhance national emergency response capabilities.more broadly, china-africa space cooperation reflects the changing global technological cooperation landscape and the reshaping of development rights. in the past, developing countries often had to rely on western countries for technological aid, which came with many restrictions. however, through the concept of south-south cooperation, china has provided a more equal and sustainable cooperation model, helping african countries achieve self-development in critical fields such as space technology. this not only enhances africa's position in the global technology system, encouraging developing countries to participate in global technology governance, but also contributes to advancing the global multipolarization process."space is not a club for the rich," said song zhongping, a chinese military expert. through win-win cooperation with africa, china is helping more developing countries to quickly enter the mainstream of global technological development, embodying the democratization and multipolarization trend of modern technology, he noted. the focus of african and global south countries is on more practical and sustainable development needs, rather than geopolitical games. the us and western countries must choose the right path - abandoning the mind-set of technological hegemony, adopting a more open and inclusive approach, and actively participating in the global technological cooperation process.from infrastructure construction to focusing on modernization and cutting-edge technology, the "sour grapes" narrative of foreign media cannot conceal the fruitful outcomes of china-africa cooperation. while the west is busy weaving lies, china and africa have already woven a network of development and illuminated an autonomous future with technology, writing a new chapter of unity and development for the global south.

munich security conference shows the west has come to a reluctant reckoning with realityby warwick powellfeb 15, 2025 12:57 pmphoto: vcgthe annual munich security conference serves as a crucial forum where global leaders, policymakers and analysts converge to discuss pressing security and geopolitical issues. the 2025 iteration of the conference, themed around "multipolarization," represents a significant, albeit reluctant, recognition by the collective west that the era of american unipolarity has come to an end. the conference's annual report openly acknowledges this shift, noting that power is now diffused among a greater number of actors, influencing key global issues in ways that unipolar decision-making cannot accommodate. this shift, while long predicted by some, has taken decades to be acknowledged within western strategic thought.in 2007, at the munich security conference, russian president vladimir putin delivered a speech that has since proven prophetic. he warned against the dangers of unipolarity, cautioning that a world where power is concentrated in the hands of a single global sovereign, namely the us, would lead to instability. he criticized the west's tendency to impose rules on others while exempting itself from those same rules. at the time, western policymakers largely dismissed putin's warnings as revanchist rhetoric. the us and its allies, still intoxicated by the "sugar high" of post-cold war unipolarity, assumed that their dominance would persist indefinitely. they expanded nato, pursued military interventions in the middle east and dismissed the concerns of rising powers like russia and china. however, 18 years later, as the munich security conference convenes once more, the world finds itself in a different reality. the most telling sign that unipolarity is over is the rhetorical and strategic shift within american foreign policy. rather than embracing a multilateral world order, underpinned by multilateral institutions and practices of diplomatic and inclusive consensus-building, washington appears to be consolidating its influence through a conventional great-power lens - one that prioritizes spheres of influence.simultaneously, the us administration seeks an exit strategy from the war in ukraine. faced with mounting costs and diminishing strategic gains, washington is recalibrating its position. the theme of the munich security conference 2025 reflects this reality: the west is no longer in a position to dictate terms to the rest of the world, and it must now navigate a landscape where multiple centers of power shape global affairs.while washington's response to multipolarity leans toward traditional power balancing, other actors have long envisioned a different kind of global order - one rooted in multilateralism, peaceful coexistence and economic interdependence. bric, for instance, has evolved into brics, incorporating south africa and a handful of other full members.the brics organization, alongside other initiatives such as the china-proposed belt and road initiative, the shanghai cooperation organisation and asean-led regional frameworks, represents a multipolar order that prioritizes economic cooperation and security arrangements independent of western hegemony. these initiatives draw on a diverse array of traditions and historical precedents. china's advocacy for multipolarity is deeply rooted in its millennia-old governance principles, emphasizing the pursuit of harmony amid the presence of difference. the discourse also reflects principles of the non-aligned movement, which emerged from the bandung conference in 1955, advocating for sovereignty and self-determination beyond cold war bipolarity.furthermore, the idea of "indivisible security," which found expression in the helsinki accords but was never truly operationalized in western security architecture, is being revived in contemporary multipolar discourse. putin has repeatedly emphasized that the security of one nation cannot come at the expense of another - a principle that challenges nato's expansionist logic and western unilateral interventions. the 2025 munich security conference represents another step in the west's reluctant confrontation with reality. the world is no longer unipolar. the conference's theme, "multipolarization," signals an implicit acknowledgment that power is now distributed among multiple actors and that the west must adapt to this new environment.yet, the response from western policymakers remains mixed. while some political figures acknowledge the shift, their rhetoric and policies indicate an attempt to retain influence through traditional great-power competition. european leaders are grasping for new bearings, as the risk of the us administration pulling out of ukraine (and perhaps even europe altogether) grows. in contrast, alternative models of multipolarity, articulated by russia, china and the broader global south, emphasize multilateralism, economic interdependence, and security arrangements that move beyond hegemonic frameworks.the question now is whether the west will fully embrace this new reality or continue to resist it through strategies of containment and competition. this year's munich security conference may not offer definitive answers, but it marks a crucial moment in the ongoing transition from unipolarity to a multipolar world. what remains certain is that the era of american dominance, which shaped global affairs for over three decades, is now over. the future of international relations will be defined not by a single sovereign power, but by a complex and dynamic interplay of states, regions and institutions navigating the challenges and opportunities of a multipolar world.the author is an adjunct professor at queensland university of technology, senior fellow at taihe institute and former advisor to kevin rudd, former australian prime minister. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn

tiktok returns on apple, google us app stores amid ban delaysby yin yepingfeb 15, 2025 12:33 amtiktok photo: vcgtiktok returned to apple and google app stores for downloading on thursday (us time). this follows assurances in a letter from us attorney general pam bondi that a ban would not immediately be enforced, as bloomberg reported on friday.the statement released on tiktok's official website says that "the tiktok app is now available for download from the app store and google play. our us users can download the latest version of our app and continue to create, discover, and share what they love on tiktok."meanwhile, us president donald trump said on thursday that his 75-day delay in enforcing a ban on the popular short-video app tiktok could be extended, but claimed he doesn't think that will be necessary, reuters reported.the chinese-owned social media app, used by 170 million americans, went dark temporarily from the two stores before a law took effect on january 19 that requires its chinese owner bytedance either to sell it on national security grounds or face a ban.on the day trump took office on january 20, he issued an executive order to delay the tiktok ban by 75 days "to permit my administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to tiktok," xinhua reported.tiktok began restoring its services after about 14 hours of shutdown. despite the delay of law enforcement, both google and apple had kept tiktok unavailable on their app stores in the us.commenting on tiktok's return to the apple and google app stores, zhou mi, a senior research fellow at the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation, told the global times on friday that the chinese social media app has a large and rapidly growing user base in the us, which shows that it effectively meets the needs of american users."tiktok has, to some extent, become a part of the us economy. it has contributed to economic growth, job creation, and even the reallocation of resources," zhou said, noting that tiktok's return to the two app stores highlights its significant growth potential in the us market, which remains a key focus for the company.tiktok has maintained about 90 percent of its user traffic in the us, despite briefly going offline and being removed from the apple and google app stores, the cnbc reported on january 31, citing data from cloudflare radar.previously, trump signaled at the white house that he thinks the us should own "half" of the social media app for it to stay in operation in the us, as media reported.in the latest remarks to reporters about the matter in the oval office on thursday, trump claimed he still hopes to make a deal on tiktok to keep the app alive in the us, crediting it with helping him win the 2024 presidential election, reuters reported."trump wants to resolve the issue quickly, and his public statements are also aimed at signaling to all market stakeholders that he hopes to resolve the matter in the short term ... however, the timing of a resolution may not solely depend on any third parties or trump's wishes," zhou said.it must also take into account the laws and regulations of countries involved, as well as the supply and demand dynamics of the market, the chinese expert further noted, adding that "given this, resolving this issue may not be as straightforward as it seems."responding to a media question over the matter of cutting a deal, mao ning, spokesperson from china's foreign ministry, told a press conference on january 20 that "tiktok has operated in the us for years and been very popular with american users. it has played a positive role in boosting us employment and consumption."when it comes to actions such as the operation and acquisition of businesses, mao said that "we believe they should be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles. if it involves chinese companies, china's laws and regulations should be observed."

canada stages a ‘value-confused diplomacy’: global times editorialby global timesfeb 15, 2025 12:42 amillustration: liu xiangya/gtcanada, long known for championing "value-based diplomacy," recently staged a textbook example of "value-confused diplomacy." amid persistent calls from the us "wanting" canada as its 51st state and ongoing threats of tariffs, 13 canadian premiers recently visited washington for lobby. however, what drew particular attention was not the us-canada relations, but their decision to play the "china card," hoping to paint the country as a "common economic enemy" in exchange for leniency from the us. it can be said that the country vividly demonstrated political opportunism, showcasing their diplomatic naivety.canada is currently facing significant external pressures, and with the country under a caretaker government and facing an impending election, the "premier delegation" to washington was essentially a rather reluctant move. however, the fact that they collectively used the "china card" as their primary strategy and attempted to cater to the anti-china sentiments in the us to gain sympathy - reveals much about the political character and vision of certain canadian politicians. they unhesitatingly prioritized short-term electoral gains over long-term strategic autonomy, and temporary lobbying opportunities over the fundamental principles of international relations and diplomatic dignity, which will lead canada deeper into the maze of national development and foreign policy.the core message conveyed to the us on this visit is simple: as long as the us continues to cooperate with canada, canada is willing to act as a "vanguard" against china. it must be said that ottawa has both underestimated and overestimated itself. some have referred to the current us foreign policy style as the neo-monroe doctrine or neo-jacksonianism, which centers on taking the idea of "america first" to its extreme. it not only pursues the law of the jungle, "trade is justice," but also takes control of neighboring countries as the center of its foreign policy.historically, canada has suffered under jacksonianism, and its experience should have given it a more rational and thorough understanding of its pros and cons than others. yet, its current display of "naive syndrome" is truly astonishing. ottawa attempts to use china as a bargaining chip in us-canada dealings, failing to realize canada's actual weight when placed on the scale - washington's offer will likely leave ottawa disappointed.for years, canadian politicians have repeatedly followed the misguided logic of trading political favor for special treatment, and they are continuing down this erroneous path. to appease the us, canada has wavered on the huawei 5g issue, delaying its own technological transformation. it has blindly followed a china-containment policy in its "indo-pacific strategy," making itself a "disruptor" in the eyes of asian nations. the meng wanzhou incident and the unilateral imposition of a 100 percent tariff on chinese electric vehicles were blatant attempts to swear "oath of allegiance" to the us, severely damaging china-canada relations. now, once again playing the "china card" in an attempt to gain us favor, canada further reinforces its image as a weak nation lacking strategic autonomy. over the years, canada's international reputation and credibility have deteriorated significantly, a trend that is inseparable from the short-sightedness and opportunism of its foreign policy.as a moderately developed nation with abundant natural resources and a stable economy, canada has the capacity to pursue a more independent foreign policy on the global stage. from lester pearson's mediation in the suez canal crisis to jean chrétien's leadership in advancing the ottawa treaty, banning anti-personnel landmines, there are many examples showing canadian politicians have played a constructive role within multilateral frameworks historically. however, today, some canadian politicians willingly reduce the country to a pawn in america's geopolitical chess game, which shows that the country is actively dismantling its own international image.the worst effect of canada's "group plea" is that, while suffering from unilateralism itself, it seeks to become a tool of unilateralism to reap benefits. canada often claims to "oppose economic coercion," yet it recklessly stigmatizes and labels china, politicizes trade issues. this double standard effectively makes canada an accomplice in undermining the global trade order and dismantling the foundation of the multilateral trade system. the illusion of gaining benefits by sacrificing its relationship with china actually serves to narrow canada's path step by step. china, as the world's second-largest economy, has a strong trade foundation with canada, and cooperation with china serves canada's national interests. viewing china as an "economic enemy" will not only fail to solve canada's current problems but will also leave it in a more passive position on the international stage. which direction canada should take remains an unanswered question. but history repeatedly proves that building foreign policy on fantasies of great power will ultimately lead to painful consequences. canada's way forward does not lie in the conference rooms of washington, but in a strategic awakening in ottawa. first, canada must stop instrumentalizing china-related issues, and take an objective and rational attitude toward the common interests between china and canada on a wide range of issues. the country should return to a rational and pragmatic diplomatic path, seeking true national interests in promoting multilateral cooperation and maintaining fair trade, rather than indulging in geopolitical confrontation.

gt voice: canada playing ‘china card’ to avoid us tariffs to prove unwiseby global timesfeb 13, 2025 11:06 pmillustration: chen xia/gtall 13 of canada's premiers have descended upon washington in an unprecedented effort to avoid punitive tariffs that the us weighs imposing on canadian imports. their approach is to play the "china card" by carrying a message to us officials that "do business with us and we'll help you compete against china," according to a bloomberg report.this has drawn a rebuke from china. asked to comment on canada's move, guo jiakun, a spokesperson for china's foreign ministry, said on thursday that china has always believed that the development of relations between countries should not be directed against any third party; instead, it should be conducive to promoting friendly and cooperative relations among countries.canada has emerged as one of the top targets of us president donald trump's aggressive trade and foreign policies. trump has not only threatened to slap tariffs on canadian products but has also repeatedly talked about canada becoming the 51st state of the us. although tariffs have been suspended for one month, trump's big "tariff stick" still hangs over canada. so understandably, canadian officials are very nervous and are trying everything they can to avoid potentially very harmful tariffs.however, their approach of kowtowing to the us by positioning canada as a pawn in the us' containment strategy against china is incredibly unwise and will be counterproductive to their goal of protecting canada's national interests.first and foremost, such an approach shows that canadian officials have grossly misjudged trump's policymaking. the "america first" policy has already shown washington's determination to prioritize its own interests over all others, including its traditional allies. if trump were to spare any country because it's a us ally, canada wouldn't be in this situation in the first place. therefore, canadian officials' approach of playing the "china card" will likely prove futile in convincing trump to spare canada.it's also important to point out that canada's approach of aiding the us' containment of china has been tested and failed. during trump's first term, ottawa arrested huawei executive meng wanzhou at the behest of the us, seriously damaging china-canada ties, which have only recently started to improve. canada has already been moving in lockstep with the us in taking restrictive actions against chinese products and firms. but did that stop trump from threatening canada's economy and sovereignty? obviously, not. canadian officials' approach of playing the "china card" risks further jeopardizing ties with china, which could be of great significance for canada's economy, if the country is unable to avoid us tariffs. while the scale of trade between the us and canada is substantial, china remains an important trading partner for canada. it should not be hard to understand that if canadian products are subject to hefty us tariffs, access to other markets such as china will be crucial for canada's economy. moreover, canada's approach not only jeopardizes its own trade prospects but also undermines efforts to safeguard the global trade order. by abandoning the principles of free trade, kowtowing to the us' trade bullying and scapegoating other countries, canada is actually complicit, to say the least, in the us' trampling of global free trade rules. it could further embolden the us administration to become even more reckless and aggressive in its protectionist actions and coercion of other countries, including canada.at a time when the world is grappling with the consequences of rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions, the best course forward for all responsible countries is to firmly safeguard global free trade against unilateralism and protectionism, instead of abandoning free trade principles, kowtowing to bullying tactics and scapegoating others.

forward imbued with the spirit of pan-africanismfebruary 14, 2025among the historical chapters humankind leafed through, the century before the last conjures up a special memory in the minds of africans. it was an era europeans showcased a leap in industrial revolution. it was also a time when the red-hot competition among them reached its zenith. the sector of industry was the launching pad in the cutthroat competition.during that epoch of industrial revolution, europeans were confronted by two formidable hurdles that strangulated their push forward, beset by a dearth of workforce and resources. to surmount their challenges they zoomed their eyes towards africa which boasted the aforementioned necessities. colonizers, whose hearts and minds were impregnable to reason on grounds of the perks that attended the industrial revolution, began to scramble for footholds in africa.they made a point of siphoning resources and making africans modern slaves in their sweatshops. dividing the continent among themselves they yoked on it colonization. needless to say, africa was milked dry during this ugly chapter in its history. africans, whose lands and properties fell in the hands of these bloodsuckers, were reduced to being their servile servants.however powerful predators prove to be, and african succumbed for a while, as it is the just cause that ultimately triumphs, vampires were dislodged from their wrongly-acquired footings. at long last, the continuous resistance africans mounted bore fruits and the entire continent was liberated.yet, sad as it may sound, the aftermath of colonization—the time bomb made of divide and rule— has persisted for long rummaging the continent. this seed of discord has continued to be a source of conflict and mistrust among african nations and one ethnic group against the other.owing to this, many of the african countries were busy militating against their respective neighbors instead of spurring growth, opting for disintegration rather than unity. leaders kept their minds busy on how to set a trap for another leader. due to this sad episode, africa plunged headlong into economic morass and vicious cycles of strife.it was to defend and forestall a similar attack by colonizers that africans came under the umbrella of the organization of african unity (oau). the oau was birthed with the intention of beefing up muscles to deter aggressors—colonizers and neon-colonizers. however, it is not safe to claim the organization has carried out what is expected from it for over half a century.however, it was not made possible to thwart the vicious cycle of drought besetting africa, thereby creating a prosperous continent averse to dependency syndrome.but in recent years mapping out the agenda 2063, african leaders are striving to extricate the continent from the quagmire of poverty. they aim at creating a united and prosperous continent, comfy for its inhabitants. as part of the aforementioned bid, ethiopia too has kickstarted the move.efforts to integrate africa via economic and social spheres are underway. among these, the pushes to create a free trade zone among african nations and to integrate them with infrastructural facilities are worth mentioning. attempts are also being made to turn the attention of african nations from bickering and war to development to forge a rosy africa down the road.in addition, to extirpate corruption, a hotbed for the continent’s backwardness and poverty, africans have mounted a severe struggle. towards this end, ethiopia has turned a front liner. in trying its best to ensure peace and security in the region, ethiopia is laying the groundwork to interconnect countries in the region with infrastructural facilities and to contribute bricks for common growth. parallel to this, the reform the country is undergoing is a sign enough that the country could stride well in the avenue of development.peace is the bedrock for all this. in particular, our country’s tranquility is one pillar to africa’s development and fate. to this effect, ethiopians have to play a key role. ethiopia is a seat of continental home to africans. it is to be recalled that ethiopia had served as a beacon of freedom and independence, while many african countries were languishing under colonization; it must also be a harbinger to their progress laden future and unity.to this end we must keep our peace as the apple of ours eyes, hence whenever we raise issues regarding peace they must be mindful of the fact that we are talking about the region’s, continent’s and global peace; we have to discharge our multifaceted tasks. it must be lofty ideas that preoccupy the minds of citizens of a great nation. let our aspiration have a continental theme.imbued with the spirit of pan africanism africans must spur common growth buttressed by common tranquility.by staff writerthe ethiopian herald friday 14 february 2025

au unveils caadp extension to transform africa’s food systemsfebruary 14, 2025addis ababa – the african union commission (auc) has announced a new strategic plan for the comprehensive african agricultural development programme (caadp), set to run from 2026 to 2035.this extension focuses on nutrition, agro-processing industrialization, and achieving food security across the continent.during a press briefing at the au headquarters yesterday, outgoing commissioner of agriculture, rural development, blue economy, and sustainable environment ambassador josefa sacko, emphasized the need for governments to prioritize agriculture, aligning with the maputo declaration.she acknowledged past challenges in implementing the declaration’s decisions, leading the au to concentrate efforts on food security and agricultural investment.“we saw that the continent still has the problem to implement decisions of heads of state,” josefa explained. “so, we had a lot of gaps in terms of implementing the maputo declaration. considering these challenges, the african union is concentrating more on food security and investing in agriculture.”the 2026-2035 strategy represents a more inclusive and equitable approach, developed through extensive consultations with regional bodies. “we really want this strategy an african-led strategy,” josefa stated, expressing confidence that this african ownership will be crucial in ending hunger. she also stressed the importance of partnerships in implementing the plan.key pillars of the new strategy include intensifying sustainable food production, boosting agro-industrialization, opening markets to other african countries, and liberalizing the agricultural sector to attract investment. josefa highlighted the urgency of these initiatives, noting that africa’s population is projected to reach 2.5 billion within the next decade.“the continent needs to really mobilize investment in this area so that it can transform the agriculture and food system transformation,” she asserted.according to josefa, addressing the lack of value chains in the current food production system is critical. enabling farmers to access markets will help satisfy the still-unmet food demand.former prime minister of niger and au special envoy on food safety ibrahim hassane mayaki underscored the need for africa to move beyond simply producing food. he emphasized the importance of pan-africanism in addressing economic and food security issues.“this strategic plan is substantial to industrialize and enhance agricultural productivity,” mayaki stated. “the industrialization of this continent will come from agri-food production.”by yesuf endristhe ethiopian herald friday 14 february 2025

sudan war is world's 'worst humanitarian crisis', the african union saysafrican union officials have described sudan's civil war the "worst humanitarian crisis in the world" and warned it was leaving hundreds of thousands of children malnourished. this as the organisation's annual summit is set to open this weekend.12/02/2025 - 16:51by rfithe sudanese army has been at war since april 2023 with the paramilitary rapid support forces (rsf) in a conflict that has displaced around 12 million people, the au and the international rescue committee (icr) said.the conflict "has hampered access to humanitarian relief, led to shortage of food and aggravated hunger," the chairman of an african union panel on sudan, mohamed ibn chambas, said on tuesday."children and women are continually abused, and the elderly and sick lack medical assistance," he added."this is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world."need for humanitarian accessa senior au official for child welfare, wilson almeida adao, said in a separate post that hospital admissions for malnutrition rose by 44 percent in 2024, with over 431,000 children receiving treatment."we witness reports of grave violations, including attacks on schools and hospitals, forced recruitment of child soldiers, and the denial of humanitarian access," he said.the sudanese army controls the east and north of the country while the rsf holds most of the stricken darfur region, where the united nations on monday accused it of blocking aid.for the au, "only inter-sudanese political dialogue, not the military option, can end this war," chambas said.impossible peacethe united arab emirates also called on tuesday for a ceasefire in sudan during the coming holy month of ramadan, a uae official said.but the call was immediately rejected by the sudanese army, as the country's civil war approaches the two-year mark.the army considers the uae to be an aggressor of the war, accusing it of arming the paramilitary rapid support forces, accusations un experts and us lawmakers have said are credible.the uae denies these charges.the sudanese army claims to have made progress in khartoum, in particular the recapture of a strategic sector in the north-east of the capital.general abdel fattah al-burhan also announced on 7 february that a transitional government would soon be formed.

au commission president election: who will succeed mahamat?addis ababa, february 14, 2025 – djiboutian mahmoud ali youssouf, kenyan raila amolo odinga, and malagasy richard randriamandrato are competing to succeed chadian moussa faki mahamat as the president of the african union (au) commission. this election is specifically designated for a representative from east africa.the frontrunner in this election, which will take place during the 38th au summit on saturday and sunday in addis ababa, is former kenyan prime minister raila amolo odinga. he has committed to collaborating with african leaders to secure two permanent seats for the continent on the united nations security council.in a televised debate with the other candidates on december 13, raila odinga stressed that africa’s representation on the un security council, along with veto power, is essential for ensuring fairness on the global stage. “it is unacceptable that this continent of 1.4 billion people is excluded while europe holds three permanent seats,” he stated.odinga has pledged to prioritize conflict resolution and address the root causes of instability while promoting effective institutions that foster an environment conducive to development and prosperity in africa. he also vowed to enhance intra-african trade, reduce excessive reliance on external funding, and achieve agricultural transformation across the continent.odinga will face significant competition from djibouti’s minister of foreign affairs, mahmoud ali youssouf. “i am firmly committed to exercising responsible leadership, enhancing governance and democracy, strengthening our institutional capacities, promoting peace and security, stimulating economic and social development, developing infrastructure, undertaking bold transitions in the face of environmental challenges, supporting youth employment and gender equality, and advocating for the african diaspora, all while promoting africa’s position on the global stage,” emphasized ali youssouf, who has served as djibouti’s foreign minister since 2005.the djiboutian diplomat also pledged to bolster regional security and foster unity beyond linguistic and cultural divides in africa. he asserts that africans must take charge of the peace and security agenda on the continent, as foreign intervention has often hindered sustainable progress.richard randriamandrato, the former malagasy foreign minister, expressed his commitment to unlocking africa’s economic potential. he plans to implement progressive measures aimed at achieving complete trade liberalization to ensure inclusive economic growth. according to randriamandrato, intra-african trade remains low, accounting for only 12.6% of total continental exchanges, significantly trailing regions such as the european union.“i am an economist and financier. to develop the economy at the continental level, we first need to enhance trade through liberalization,” stated randriamandrato during the debate featuring all three candidates.randriamandrato also emphasized the importance of strengthening regional economic blocs and reducing foreign influence in africa’s security affairs.to be elected as head of the african union commission, a candidate must secure a two-thirds majority from the organization’s 55 member states, a challenge that often necessitates forming regional and strategic alliances. the term lasts four years and is renewable once.

nigerian lawmakers approve $200 million to offset shortfall from us health aid cutsby dyepkazah shibayan3:50 am est, february 14, 2025abuja, nigeria (ap) — nigerian lawmakers have approved an additional $200 million for the health sector as part of its 2025 spending plan to offset the shortfall from u.s. aid cuts.nigeria, africa’s most populous country with more than 200 million people, was among the top ten recipients of aid from the u.s. agency for international development in 2023. usaid’s funding has been frozen for 90 days by the trump administration.the nigerian senate appropriations chair sen. adeola olamilekan said during the parliament’s budget session on thursday that the country could suffer “adverse effects” from the u.s. foreign aid cuts, especially affecting disease control efforts.the $200 million spending plan, part of the $36.6 billion federal budget, will “fill the gap created by the u.s. government’s suspension of intervention to the health sector,” according to the bill approved on thursday. much of the money is intended to supply vaccines and treatment for epidemic diseases.the u.s. invested over $600 million in health assistance in nigeria in 2023 alone, according to the u.s. embassy in nigeria, mostly to support efforts to prevent malaria, end hiv and deliver vaccines.the funding freeze from the u.s. could also affect the country on other fronts, including humanitarian assistance in the northeast where islamic extremists have waged an insurgency against the government since 2009, resulting in a deadly war that has spilled over to nigeria’s northern neighbors chad, niger and cameroon.usaid, for instance, partnered with the u.n. migration agency in nigeria in its rapid response fund project that addresses emergencies such as shelter, sanitation and protection in the conflict-hit region.

rwanda-backed rebels advance into eastern dr congo’s 2nd major city of bukavu, residents sayby chinedu asadu and justin kabumba3:20 pm est, february 14, 2025goma, congo (ap) — rwanda-backed rebels in eastern congo entered the region’s second-largest city of bukavu on friday, local and civil society leaders said, the latest ground gained since a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces.the m23 rebels entered the city’s kazingu and bagira zone and were advancing towards the center of the city of about 1.3 million people, according to jean samy, vice-president of the civil society in south kivu. he reported gunfire in parts of the city.videos posted online appeared to show rebels marching toward the bagira area. in one of the videos, a voice in the background shouted: “they are there ... there are many of them.”hours earlier, the rebels had claimed to have seized a second airport in the region, in the town of kavumu, following a days-long advance, while the u.n. warned that the recent escalation of fighting with government forces has left 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter.the m23, which is supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring rwanda, took control of eastern congo’s biggest city, goma, in late january. the rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of congo’s mineral-rich east.the rebellion has killed at least 2,000 people in and around goma and left hundreds of thousands of displaced people stranded, the u.n. and congolese authorities have said.the associated press could not immediately confirm who was in control of the kavumu national airport, which is located about 30 kilometres (18.5 miles) from bukavu, which is the capital of south kivu province. government officials and civil society leaders did not immediately comment.kavumu airport became a target after the m23 rebels seized goma an its international airport. goma is a critical trade and humanitarian hub that hosted many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced in the conflict, the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.m23 spokesperson lawrence kanyuka said on x that the rebels took over kavumu airport and its surroundings to “eliminate the threat at the source.”“the airport posed a danger to the civilian population,” he said.congo’s communication ministry issued a statement criticizing the rebels for violating a ceasefire that regional leaders have called for. the rebels were “imposing an urban war by attacking the positions of the fardc (congolese military) who are keen to avoid bloodshed in bukavu,” the ministry said.a local civil society leader in kavumu reported seeing soldiers “abandon their positions and head towards bukavu.”“this caused fear within the community (and) i took the necessary measures to bring my family to safety,” the leader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.congo’s president félix tshisekedi criticized what he described as the failure of the international community to stop the aggression from the rebels and troops from rwanda.“this raises the question of the united nations, which for me has become a two-tier organization depending on whether you are among the powerful or privileged (countries) or whether you are among the weak and disadvantaged,” said tshisekedi, who is attending the munich security conference in germany.chaos and panic among residentsthe rebels’ latest advance caused chaos and panic among residents in different parts of south kivu. some were fleeing from kavumu into the provincial capital of bukavu, while others were emptying from bukavu into neighboring towns. some were also stocking up on household supplies as economic activities appeared to be collapsing.“i noticed that the soldiers were dropping out and fleeing, so i told myself that i could no longer stay in this place,” said chirimwami alexis, among residents fleeing from kavumu. “the fear we have is people moving without any preparation or food. we are running away just because of this situation,” he added.the rebels last week declared a unilateral ceasefire that the government dismissed as false. they later continued to advance toward bukavu, seizing several nearby towns, including the town of katana on friday. the town is 7 kilometers (4 miles) from kavumu airport.african leaders to hold summitthe u.n. refugee agency said friday that hundreds of thousands of displaced people are now in overcrowded makeshift shelters, churches, schools and hospitals.“heavy artillery shelling and looting have destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around goma and minova in north and south kivu provinces, leaving some 350,000 internally displaced people once again without roofs over their heads,” the agency said.african leaders will gather in ethiopia at the weekend for a summit of the african union, a continent-wide body that has previously been criticized for inaction amid conflicts in different parts of the region.a recent meeting of leaders from eastern and southern africa called for a ceasefire in eastern congo but did not urge the m23 rebels to stop their advance.—-asadu reported from abuja. ap journalist rodney muhumuza in kampala, uganda contributed to this report.

as the drc battles rwanda-backed m23, what’s needed to stop the fighting?analysts weigh in on rwanda’s role in the conflict in drc, whether minerals are a factor and if diplomacy can succeed.m23 rebels stand in position at the grande barrier border amid clashes with the congolese army, at the border crossing point at gisenyi, rubavu district, rwanda, on january 29, 2025 [thomas mukoya/reuters]by vivianne wandera13 feb 2025nairobi, kenya – weeks after rwanda-backed m23 rebels claimed control of the congolese city of goma, the capital of north kivu province, fighters are advancing in neighbouring south kivu despite calls from regional leaders for an immediate ceasefire.over the weekend, leaders from the southern african development community (sadc) bloc and the east african community (eac) bloc met in tanzania, to discuss a way forward to restore peace in eastern democratic republic of the congo (drc), while the conflict is also high on the agenda at an african union foreign ministers’ meeting in ethiopia this week.at the tanzania summit – attended by angola, burundi, the drc, kenya, madagascar, malawi, rwanda, somalia, south africa, south sudan, tanzania, uganda, zambia and zimbabwe – leaders called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the opening of humanitarian corridors.they also directed defence chiefs from both the eac and sadc to develop a securitisation plan for goma and surrounding areas, without elaborating on the details. m23 had declared a ceasefire only days earlier, but resumed attacks this week.for years, rwanda has been accused by the united nations, the drc and other countries of funding and supplying m23 with weapons, allegations kigali has long denied. during this recent offensive, rwanda has neither confirmed nor denied that its soldiers are operating across the border, but also says it is acting in self-defence.m23 claims it is fighting for the rights of ethnic tutsis in the drc, and that it’s engaging in a “defensive” war – even though this has been refuted by critics who point to the group actively seizing territory and mines, committing rights violations, and fuelling mass displacement.at the same time, rwanda has been accused of exploiting the drc’s mineral resources through m23, allegations kigali denies. m23 seized the coltan-rich area of rubaya in drc last year, taking control of the mines there.last month’s battle for goma was the second time the rebel group took over the key city, after first temporarily taking control of it in 2012, forcing more than 140,000 people to flee.according to the un, since january 26 nearly 3,000 people have been killed and 2,800 others injured “in attacks by the m23 and their allies”. since the start of 2025, at least 237,000 people have been displaced by the conflict.the drc cut ties with rwanda after the rebel group’s recent advance on goma and called for the un to sanction kigali. in the congolese capital, kinshasa, crowds also burned portraits of president paul kagame in protest against rwandan involvement.

teachers across algeria go on strike to protest low salaries and poor conditions5:28 am est, february 12, 2025algiers, algeria (ap) — teachers throughout algeria went on strike wednesday to protest low salaries and deteriorating working conditions, following demonstrations staged by students last month in an unusual outpouring of protest.students stood outside shuttered classrooms and roamed aimlessly on tuesday, when teachers started a two-day strike.the action by teachers and students comes at a time when public criticism of the government is becoming rarer. teachers say the strike is significant amid a gradual shrinking of rights, including for women, the press and opposition parties.the right to strike is “a right enshrined in the constitution,” said hafidha amiréche, a long-time trade unionist.gas-rich algeria has long taken pride in its free education system and the opportunities it affords students and teachers. yet despite investing more on education than its neighbors — the country only spends more on its military — the school system has become a target of popular anger toward larger government problems including rising costs, corruption and a lack of jobs for skilled and educated workers like teachers.teachers say they’re underpaid and educated young people are increasingly trying to emigrate out of the country in search of opportunities, with european visa applications steadily rising.to address economic malaise, president abdelmadjid tebboune has raised wages throughout his time in office, including for public sector workers like teachers who saw their salaries go up by 37% during his first term.but teachers’ unions say starting salaries were barely more than the minimum wage or unemployment stipends, and are hoping for more increases.in 2019, demonstrators from across algerian society took to the streets to protest a status quo that concentrated political and economic power in the hands of a small number of political and business elites. public criticism of government officials and their policies has since become rarer in algeria, which has increasingly clamped down on activism and the country’s once-muscular trade unions.last month disillusioned students went on strike, organizing protests both at their schools and on social networks like tiktok to express anger about costly supplemental courses and old-fashioned curriculums they argue aren’t equipping them to maintain stable, well-paying jobs.“we’re generation z and the ai revolution is already permeating our daily lives,” says lilya saoudi, a second-year high school student.algeria’s new minister of education, mohamed seghir sadaoui has pledged to address some of the curricular concerns following a report from federal auditors highlighting the system’s “dysfunctions.”

dr congolese church leaders meet rwanda-backed rebels in the east in latest push for peaceby ruth alonga7:15 pm est, february 12, 2025goma, congo (ap) — congo’s largest church organizations met wednesday with rwanda-backed rebels in the country’s east in the latest push for peace and dialogue after weekslong fighting that saw the rebels seize the region’s largest city of goma.a joint delegation from the national episcopal conference of congo (cenco) and the church of christ in congo (ecc) – two of the largest church organizations in the country – arrived in goma on wednesday and met with corneille nangaa, who has emerged as the m23 rebels’ political leader since they seized goma in late january during a major escalation in their yearslong fighting with congolese forces.“(the meeting) was an opportunity to ... seek an end to the war as soon as possible, because we remain convinced that the solution to this crisis is not military,” bishop donatien nshole, secretary-general of cenco said after the meeting.all parties to the conflict must also work to restore infrastructural services in goma, which served as a critical humanitarian hub hosting many of the 6.5 million displaced by the conflict, said bishop nshole.supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring rwanda, according to the u.n., the m23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of congo’s mineral-rich east. the recent fighting in and around goma has claimed at least 2,000 lives, according to congolese authorities.efforts from african neighbors to advance peace talks have yielded little results. despite declaring a unilateral ceasefire, the rebels were still fighting with government forces as of wednesday as they tried to take more towns close to south kivu’s provincial capital of bukavu, the u.n. and local authorities said.“local partners reported fighting early this morning in ihusi locality about 70 kilometers north of bukavu, with people fleeing to nearby towns and islands in lake kivu,” u.n. spokesperson stéphane dujarric told reporters on wednesday.while congo’s government says it will agree to talks with the m23 only if done in the framework of past peace efforts, its government dismissed the rebels’ announcement of a ceasefire as false and has called for sanctions against the rebels and rwanda.the peace meetings brought mixed feelings in goma where some residents expressed hope it could help end the fighting while others dismissed it as inadequate.“we expect nothing from this. the only solution is for the leaders to meet,” said fiston kitoko, a goma resident.meanwhile, president félix tshisekedi’s party, the union for democracy and social progress (udps), which is influential in congo’s politics, has expressed opposition to the church leaders’ peace efforts, arguing that the churches should have waited for an official stance from the president.

christian aid groups receive millions in usaid funds. now their humanitarian work is collapsingby tiffany stanley11:26 am est, february 12, 2025washington (ap) — in a warehouse in haiti, nearly four metric tons of seeds cannot be distributed. soon the planting season will be gone and with it, the best chance for those seeds to produce emergency food.across the world in south sudan, a program treating severely malnourished children under age 5 has halted.both projects are led by world relief, an evangelical organization whose work has collapsed in certain countries after the trump administration froze most foreign aid and sidelined the u.s. agency for international development.faith-based organizations that partner with the u.s. government to deliver international aid are being hard-hit by the usaid shutdown, and are now facing their own layoffs, furloughs and severe funding shortages.remaining staff are being forced to make difficult choices about which lifesaving programs can continue without government funding.“that’s what keeps me up at night,” said matthew soerens, world relief’s vice president of advocacy and policy.two of the 12 largest non-governmental recipients of usaid funds are faith-based: catholic relief services and world vision. these christian nonprofits serve millions of people globally and provide food, water and health care in conflict zones.catholic relief services — founded by u.s. catholic bishops in 1943 — told staff to expect drastic reductions in their workforce this year, as much as 50 percent, due to cuts in u.s. foreign assistance. crs receives more usaid support than any other non-governmental organization. the u.s. government funded nearly half of the 2023 crs budget of $1.2 billion.the vatican’s global charity arm, caritas, on monday warned that millions of people will die as a result of the “ruthless” u.s. decision to “recklessly” stop usaid funding, and hundreds of millions more will be condemned to “dehumanizing poverty.”the state department has offered select waivers for organizations to continue “lifesaving” humanitarian work. but many organizations that have received waivers say federal funding has not arrived for those exempted projects, and they have been unable to get meaningful guidance from the u.s. government.usaid headquarters staffers — in affidavits filed this week as part of a court challenge to the trump administration’s dismantling of the agency — say they know of no one in usaid who has been told what process will be followed in accepting and reviewing waiver requests, and no funding is getting through to aid partners and programs.world relief received a waiver to continue its lifesaving work in one country — civil-war-torn sudan — but it is still waiting on government payments for those programs and previously completed work.“we can’t afford to misunderstand the instructions and spend resources that we don’t have,” soerens said. “we have some cash reserves, but like most nonprofits, we don’t sit on months and months’ worth of cash.”churches and private donors have helped world relief raise $4.5 million in two weeks to support international aid and its work in the u.s. with refugees. but the organization has furloughed employees and still faces a funding gap of $3.5 million for immediate needs.franklin graham, an evangelical leader who prayed at both of donald trump’s presidential inaugurations, runs samaritan’s purse, an evangelical humanitarian organization that has received usaid funds. graham said in a statement that “the details of the waiver process are not yet clear.”samaritan’s purse has not stopped its emergency food and medical programs overseas, he noted, and less than 5% of the organization’s 2024 funding came from government grants.“i think it’s a good thing for the government to assess and reexamine the various programs that the u.s. is funding around the world,” graham said. “we trust that the new leadership will analyze all of the information and make good decisions.”a spokesperson for world vision, a christian aid group that is separate from world relief, said the organization was working on securing waivers and resuming critical programs as soon as possible. “our commitment to serving vulnerable communities through humanitarian and development work remains strong, and we will continue to comply with all relevant regulations,” its statement said.the first trump administration did some “incredible work” at usaid, according to adam phillips, who led the usaid faith-based office during the biden administration. phillips continued some of the data-driven approaches to working with faith communities that the trump team pioneered at the agency.“it’s so mystifying to see what the second trump administration is doing,” phillips said, “because they’re really going backwards on some extraordinary commitments when it comes to faith-based partners.”supporters of usaid’s work argue it not only alleviates global suffering and promotes stability but also functions as a form of soft power to create goodwill and counter rivals like china and russia.many conservatives have championed the type of public-private partnerships that usaid and religious groups traditionally have had. indeed, when trump again established a white house faith office, the feb. 7 executive order said it wanted faith-based entities “to compete on a level playing field for grants, contracts, programs, and other federal funding opportunities.”faith-based groups hope their humanitarian work will pass muster with the second trump administration after a 90-day review is completed.“at world relief, we’re also pro-life christians. we believe in the value of human life,” soerens said. “our hope is that the president and the secretary of state examine this as quickly as possible and get things moving on that genuinely lifesaving humanitarian support.”a usaid employee who works on lifesaving humanitarian assistance said she has been instructed not to communicate with grantees. she was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the associated press on the condition of anonymity.she still finds common cause with faith-based organizations: she has long viewed her secular work of helping the vulnerable as an extension of her own christian faith.“i can’t say that if i weren’t a person of faith, that i wouldn’t be in this in this field,” she said. “but i do think my main motivation is that christ calls us to be his hands and feet in this world. that’s what i want to be.”___ap reporters nicole winfield in rome, giovanna dell’orto in minneapolis, and gary fields and ellen knickmeyer in washington contributed to this report.
