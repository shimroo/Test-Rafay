student life at texas tech

 
 
student life embodies the student experience here at texas tech university. student
                        life staff work to enhance the student experience outside the classroom by delivering
                        robust programs and services, opportunities to connect with fellow students, and promoting
                        responsible citizenship as a member of the red raider community. our desired outcome
                        is to guide students toward accomplishing academic, personal and professional goals.
while on campus, students have the opportunity to get involved in any of our over
                        600 student organizations, form lifelong friendships, make lasting memories, and have
                        fun! there are a variety of ways to get involved on campus, including the student
                        government association (sga), becoming a member of a fraternity or sorority, cheering
                        for the red raiders along with our ttu spirit squads, and so much more. we encourage
                        you to explore all that ttu has to offer!
