the commandments are scientific wonders of causiality 


(the relationship of cause and effect) 
an action produces a determinable effect (causality). 
yahuah gave us the commandments to promote positive effects, but people mistake 
them as a religious thing. yahuahâs commandments are scientifically designed to 
produce good when obeyed.
they were 

not given 
to mankind to prove we cannot obey them.

the kjv is anglican catholic, 
yet was part of the plan of yahuah to teach the nations his word through a 
jabbering lip and a foreign tongue: the english language. it is the english 
translation of the catholic latin vulgate.
