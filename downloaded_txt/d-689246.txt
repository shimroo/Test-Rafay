our company
learn more about our longtime passion for  premium candy and unique products.

las olas confections have long been backed by a guarantee of the highest quality ingredients, outstanding freshness and uniquely distinctive flavors. it’s no wonder that the company has been delighting candy lovers with brands that have been around for decades. but did you know that we’ve also earned a reputation as a trusted partner of premium private label confections?  after years of perfecting the manufacture of some of the country’s most recognized brands and award-winning products, las olas confections and snacks knows more than a thing or two about how to get sweet jobs done — and done expertly well.  
our 80,000 square foot, sqf level 2 certified, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in orlando, florida qualifies us as the largest specialty chocolate and confections manufacturer in the southeastern united states. that’s just one of the reasons why we have also become known as an extraordinary partner for producing private label brands.
we’ve been supplying confectionary favorites for our brands oh!asis™ (formerly anastasia® and coconut island® brands), williams & bennett® and hoffman’s chocolates® as well a number of brands delivered under private label. 
the array of premium confections we produce is nothing short of astounding. our services are turnkey and end-to-end. our facility includes essential capabilities for extruding and enrobing, kitchen/table operation, molding, taffy and high-speed packaging lines in accordance with today’s retail packaging standards. 
confection production includes making brittle and toffee, fudge, french and european style meltaway truffles, molded chocolates, buttercreams and bars, compound and chocolate bark. we also have multiple packaging capabilities such as flow wrap, form-sealed bags, stand-up gusset pouches, paperboard boxes and plastic containers. no project is too big or too small – case in point, for certain capabilities like bark, fudge or enrobing, capacities can exceed tens of thousands per 8-hour shift.
