the secret sauce for thought-leadership writing:


it’s all in the story angle
understanding thought-leadership writing is one thing.
doing it, and doing it well, is another.
how do you quickly attract people to your idea and engage the reader? how do you find the right point of view?
simply put: you’ve got to think like a journalist and find the right story angle.
that process is called story framing.
when a story is framed well, sophisticated readers will gladly hear what you have to say.
