yes.  i've come back.  for now.  i've really been grieving.  as the description of my blog says a "look alike" brittany.  i never claimed to be her.  the whole brittany thing emanated from two people who are dearest in the world to me mentioned my resemblance.  not really being too aware of her, i began to look her up.....her photos and read about her.  she struggled with eating issues (as do i).  she wanted to be better than she was (the same).  she searched for love (don't we all).  she was gifted and talented and a huge light in the world.  i feel as though a part of me has died along with her.  i couldn't decide whether to come back here or not.  i'm here for now.

baby, it's cold outside! the snow is pretty; the driving is not. luckily, i have a big pot of coffee and pan of frosted brownies waiting to be devoured. yes, i have to work today. no, i did not quit my job yet. nor do i intend to do so. how's the windfall? intact. i was absolutely right to keep a conservative stance when i did though. let's leave it at that.can't believe it is march. i can't wait for summer. i can't remember being warm. really warm. hope you guys are staying comfortable. thanks for not giving up on me!

happy new year!  i realize i'm a little late.  sorry about that.  it's not that i don't think about you guys but i do!  i had every intention of writing during my vacation (christmas/holidays).  i had lots of company (work and fun) and volunteer work.  of course, i had no idea when i got promoted that it would be so much more work.  i mean alot more.  the fact is that because not many women do what i do so i can't exactly just "get by" because i don't need the money.  i feel like i have to work harder to prove because i am a woman that they made a good choice.  let's see ......what else have i been up to?  work.....i said that.  volunteer stuff........i said that.  ah.......i've had a tremendous house project.  i'm cleaning out like crazy.  stacks and stacks of paper.  how have i accumulated so much paper????  i guess you could say i'm having a windfall moment cleaning.  maybe not a fun one.labels: holiday, windfall moment

the sun is out today for the first time in a week!  fall is here; it's my favorite season.  i can't wait for it to feel like fall.  today i'm going to grab some rays.  and some happiness!  i've decided that for me - a sunny day is a windfall!labels: windfall moment
