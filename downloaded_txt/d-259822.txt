gray's reef national marine sanctuary







statement from superintendent stan rogers
oct. 21, 2024


on behalf of noaa's office of national marine sanctuaries and grayâs reef national marine sanctuary, we extend our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the gullah-geechee people, sapelo community, our colleagues, friends, and everyone affected, as we grieve those lost during the tragedy at the marsh landing dock on sapelo island. thank you to those who were quick to act, treating injured persons and preventing greater loss of life. our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by this tragedy and we offer our deepest sympathies.
sincerely,
stan rogers


gray's reef national marine sanctuary is an ocean park teeming with life. the natural
          live-bottom habitats of the sanctuary are representative of others across the region. the sanctuary provides
          year-round opportunities for sport fishing, recreational diving, and boating. the research area within the
          sanctuary hosts one of the only designated no-take zones in the region, which makes gray's reef a catalyst for
          scientific research studying water quality, ocean noise, hurricane prediction, and climate change.

gray's reef national marine sanctuary, located off the coast of georgia. the reef's
              scattered rocky outcroppings and ledges provide home for an abundance of marine life, which form a dense
              carpet of living creatures called a "live bottom." this poster highlights the true beauty and importance
              of the waters surrounding gray's reef.
