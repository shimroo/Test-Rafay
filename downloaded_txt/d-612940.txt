our 2024 divine purpose statement:

we believe that we are called to live in service to others following the example of jesus christ, our savior, helping to heal a broken world and preserve god’s creation. we believe god calls us to accept and celebrate everyone - lgbtqia+, race/ethnicity, status, age, or ability - no exceptions. we worship in community, in-person and online. grounded in the book of common prayer, our prayer and music embraces diversity of spiritual life. all are invited to receive holy eucharist at god’s table and to participate in worship. children are a valued presence and contribute to worship. we serve all of god’s people in partnership with our local, national, and international neighbors, learning from them and working with them toward true justice and equitable access to god’s abundance.
