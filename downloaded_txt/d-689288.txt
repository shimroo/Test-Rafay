enjoy the beauty of a cedar home 










thank you for your interest in our modern yet classic cedar homes. our home packages are unique in the log home industry, incorporating several different wall system options to meet clientsâ expectations, budget, and energy requirements for your area. our laminated timbers, and energy efficient wall systems leave all of the worry and maintenance out of the picture. the laminating process eliminates much of the core moisture and allows for fast wall assembly â without the excessive settling that can happen in traditional log homes. incorporating a thermal break into our laminated wall systems has opened new doors for everyone!our timber walls require only 1â³ of space above doors and windows (just like a conventionally-framed home). a handcrafted log home can require anywhere from 6-8â³ of space above doors and windows â to allow for settling. our construction system requires no adjustments for seasonal expansion and contraction. with our laminated wood wall system, our customers enjoy all the beauty of natural wood without the hassles!

what our clients are saying... 










friendly, honestdave and ruthe rughin 1986 we were searching for a way to build our dream home on the olympic penninsula. our search included many local companies selling log home kits as well as companies across the u.s. there are many aspects of their homes that put them in lead contention among their competitors. their friendly, honest approach was just what we needed. to us it was daunting to mesh our dreams with the reality of materials and construction, but cedar homes of washington got us through it.an extremely positive experiencejim and susannah lakewe were looking at cabin packages to build a retreat in the mountains for our family. their openness, friendliness and willingness to help is genuine. we never felt any pressure to give a commitment. the fact that the home they live in is a product they built themselves from a kit is a positive statement that they know the design and build process - have been through it - and know first hand about long term maintenance, etc. for these type of structures.

the summer of 2004, we had a contractor build the shell of our cabin and it was an extremely positive experience. there have been minor issues that have come up during the building process, such as shortages for hardware. cedar homes of washington have always promptly returned phone calls and remedied the situation in short order. we cannot think of a way that they could improve the way they conduct their business or improve their customer service.so wonderfulrob & mary stumphwe just wanted to thank you so much for being so wonderful in helping us build our home. we know the home package could have been a stressful part, but it wasn't at all - thanks to you.very impressedtaro and nami kusunosecedar homes of washington put together a package for us including getting the drawings and plans prepared and getting all of the materials put together. the drawings and plans were spot on and the city of newcastle had very little to comment on before approving them. the materials package was estimated just right. the materials were top notch. our builder was very impressed by how well the materials package was thought through and put together - so were we. every step of the way, we were given advice that we later found to be on the mark. cedar homes of washington's involvement in our project technically could have ended as soon as the materials package was delivered. nevertheless, cedar homes of washington continued to check in on us all the way through the end of the project. we enjoyed working with cedar homes of washington and wholeheartedly recommend them to others.
