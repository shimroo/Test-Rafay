our goals

                                temperment is very important because all of our pit bulls must be trusted around
                                our children, and we want others to be able to trust them with their children.
                                we also used these dogs to hunt wild boar for many years. temperment is important
                                when hunting with dogs because they must have the ability to do their job while being easy
                                to handle by any hunter.
                                
                                    our goal is to produce, quality, healthy, even-tempered american pit bull terriers
                                    with the ability to do it all!
                                








beauty is a bonus

                                we want to stress that we are not breeding for size or for color.
                                we are striving to achieve the total package. drive and structure interest us
                                most because these are working dogs. if you are looking to own a red nose pitbull
                                that will provide your family with years of enjoyment and get that "wow, what a beautiful dog!"
                                reaction, one of our dogs will definitely fulfill your needs. not only are our red nose
                                pitbulls beautiful, they also have wonderful temperments, awesome structure and
                                conformation, true working ability, and drive... all in one package!!!
                            




their job


                                while the most important job that any dog can do, is being a loving, and loyal companion.
                                we have the satisfaction of knowing that our dogs are intelligent and digilent enough to perform
                                nearly any task that is required of them.
                                we used our red nose pit bulls as hog dogs to catch wild boar for many years, but they also make
                                wonderful family pets. the red nose pitbulls that we have produced have been used
                                for other kinds of work too, including personal protection work, weight pulling,
                                schutzhund training, and several of our red nose pit bulls have been featured on
                                tv and in the apbt gazette.
                            






keeping gameness alive

                                we are in favor of working pit bulls in a sport (like hog hunting) where they
                                can test and prove themselves legally. this keeps gameness alive in the breed.
                                gameness is the desire to keep going when hurt, tired and even losing.
                                this combined with the willingness to protect their loved ones, are the hallmarks of the pit bull breed,
                                and that is what we are working to preserve.
                            







pit bulls & kids

                                our pit bulls are fearless warriors while hunting, and fearless guard dogs when it comes to
                                protecting their family. contrary to what some people say, pit bulls love children.
                                our kids have been raised up with pit bulls since birth. our dogs would give their lives to protect
                                our children (as if they were their own) and i feel my childrens lives have been enriched because they
                                have these dogs in their life.
                            





unconditional love

                                i would protect my dog with my life just as they would do for me! it is an unconditional love.
                                
                                    in my opinion, having a dog for a friend is much
                                    better than having a human for a friend.
                                 a dog will never judge you and they love you for who you are!
                                no matter what.

                                    why i have him as a working dog. he's calm, cool, collective, people friendly dog, but he knows

gracie

                                    just wanted to say gracie is an amazing girl. i can't believe her agility and coordination she already has
                                    at this age. she is very easy to train, very bright and wants to please. great dog!!!
                                

                                    gracie is in training at bullet proof pitbulls in canada. jeremy only trains what he thinks is worth training
                                    and he really likes her. he says she has the right dna, good breeding and serious attitude when messed with by the
                                    pack of pups she is with. now he has to harness and control it for the handler to turn it on and off. he says she is
                                    a sweet girl but has the right disposition and is really motivated to please. p.s. my wife has two yorkshire's 8 and 10 lbs.
                                    gracie seems to like and put up with.

                                    she goes crazy with my daughter, so totally happy about that... loves the couch,
                                    and sleeping with my daughter lol. she goes to the bathroom outside, we couldn't be
                                    more happy.
                                

                                    she came to a home with tons of space and gets plenty of love. she's already spoiled...
                                    it makes me happy that you actually care. so happy we decided to purchase from you.
