add talk of the town big band to maggie speaks to make your event larger than life with the thrill and high energy spectacle of an active horn section, choreographed strings, and multiple lead singers. with talk of the town big band, maggie speaks can scale the band anywhere from eight to fifteen pieces for a musical ensemble of world class musicians and entertainers who come together to create an experience you will ever forget. with a large footprint of horns, guitars, drums, vocalists, strings, and more, talk of the town big band produces a wall of sound and energy and exceptional choreography, unchained to reading lyrics on music stands.
