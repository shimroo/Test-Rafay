            coronavirus guidance
    






from 1 august you can no longer request a new credit card payment holiday, or extend an existing one.
if you have any questions about a payment holiday you’ve taken previously, please read our frequently asked questions below. 
if you’re currently experiencing financial difficulties and you’re worried about making your monthly payments, please let us know as soon as possible. we can discuss the right support for you based on your individual circumstances. but please be aware that the support we offer may have an impact on your credit file. 







how did my payment holiday work? 









your payment holiday meant you didn’t need to make monthly payments over the payment holiday period.
you should have received a letter from us confirming this change. there’ll be no other changes to your terms and conditions, which continued to apply during the payment holiday. 
if you usually pay by direct debit, we won’t have collected any payments from you over this period 
at the end of the payment holiday, your minimum payment will go back to the usual calculation, as set out in your current terms and conditions. this will be based on a percentage of the total amount you owe at the time. it will take into account any increase due to interest, or use of your card, during the payment holiday period. this means that when you start making payments again, your minimum payment may be higher than it was before your payment holiday.  














did interest and charges apply during my payment holiday? 









interest continued to apply at the usual rates during your payment holiday, as well as standard charges (for example, if you used your card to withdraw cash). we didn’t apply any charges for going over your credit limit during the payment holiday. there were also no charges for paying late, as there were no minimum payments due over this period.
as you didn’t have to make any payments during the payment holiday period, you may not have paid off all the interest added to your account. this means there’ll be interest charged on that interest, as well as on transactions added to your account. 
your balance may also have increased if you continued to use your card during the payment holiday, so you could be paying interest on a higher amount and you may have noticed your minimum payment is higher following your payment holiday. 
if you usually make the minimum or fixed payments, it’s worth considering whether you can afford a higher amount. this will reduce the extra time it could take to clear your balance, as well as the interest you’ll pay.  














did my payment holiday affect my credit file? 









taking a payment holiday won’t have affected your credit file, but providers may consider other information when making future lending decisions.














 why aren’t payment holidays available anymore?  









the option to request a payment holiday has been removed in line with guidance provided by the financial conduct authority. however, there’s still support available which will be tailored to your individual circumstances. it’s important to note that the options we have available are likely to impact your credit file.
