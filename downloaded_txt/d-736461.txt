youtube got it right — an adventure in seo 

the plan for 2025 has been progressing nicely. there are three main goals. “a book about making web games” is a difficult project but at least the work has started, the crossy road chicken tournament has also started, and the super mario world all exits guide is complete. although, did i make a mistake by scheduling the video to launch so far into the future? was it a bad idea to schedule it for march 8, 2025? that’s the saturday before mario day (mar10). how is youtube handling the search engine optimization for “premiere” videos?
