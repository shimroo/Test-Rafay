2023 chevrolet corvette ht convertible this is a story about a new corvette that was ordered by my clients, becka and kevin, who have been using my services & assistance for acquiring vehicles for many years. the order was placed two years ago, which means that kevin is a very patient person. knowing how much time it would take to get their new corvette, kevin asked me if he could find a used one in the same color. i said maybe, no promises, but agreed to help and was lucky enough to find one exactly the way kevin wanted – all red, 1400 miles, and a convertible. 
he was thrilled to share this news with becka and kevin, who went ahead and made the purchase that very day. experiences like these are what makes my day, and it confirms my decision to get into the car business, sooo many years ago! [1960] i thank myself every day for making that choice!
kevin& becka’s 2023 corvette ht convertible! a two-year wait! wow

let me introduce my newest friends, lee & his wife debbie. they live the quiet life in peaceful cave creek to help, arizona! lee reached out to help him find or locate a 2025 ford f-150 king ranch supercrew 4x4 highbrid white.



my newest friends, lee & his wife debbie! of course i wanted to put photos, behind the voice! we have become the best friends! ages 86 & 87!!!
























i am a retired trial lawyer and was pretty good at trying lawsuits, but especially good at “the art of the deal” in getting them settled. i had contacted several ford dealers in the phoenix area but was tired of their misleading statements so i called ken, a “car broker”. he worked tirelessly and found the 2025 model f-150 king ranch i so wanted and did the bargaining for it with a ford dealer in las vegas yet! the salesman even drove it to my home in az at no charge! i could not be more pleased with ken’s service and help. i highly recommend him if you are in search of a new or previously owned hard-to-find car (or even one just waiting to be sold). i highly recommend you call ken nichols for his expertise and help. lee, in cave creek,  az







2023 ford maverick, for my clients mr/mrs wally, & karen johnson, mesa, az.

this the second,2nd that’s right… about a year and have ago, i located a maverick in harrisburg, pa. from a dealer there, and wally, purchased it & had it shipped to mesa, az. so why, did he buy a 2nd one so close together, well his wife karen, had a accident in the first one, so wally wanted me to set up a deal on a second one, maybe a little closer to arizona, and here to go again & find one at a much better price in utah, how about that? again wally were happy customers again… so they sent me a thank-you message, and it reads as follows: hi ken, just wanted to thank you again for all your hard work on finding us the perfect maverick we requested!! you are so easy to work with and you are honest and fair. you never give up until the goal is reached!!! if we ever need to locate a car or truck again we will definitely be calling you again!
thank you! karen and wally johnson                   

my first car deal outside the united states, in spain
tim & jill langham 
we contacted ken from overseas as we needed help locating a suitable car for our arrival back in the us. to begin with we had a list of possible suitable cars, the features that we were looking for and the budget. ken was prompt and extremely courteous with his replies making suggestions that he thought would suit us. he also worked around the time difference between us, which often resulted in him sending early morning replies when having his breakfast or even from the doctors office. when we eventually decided on the make and model that we wanted ken did his best to help us find it and get us the car when we wanted it, even agreeing to meet us from the airport to take us to the dealership. it was a pleasure working with ken, especially when he was able to sooth a difficult situation at the dealership when customer service was left wanting. we would certainly recommend ken to anyone looking for help purchasing a new or used vehicle. i am so sorry for the late response as i had two dr spots on the tim & jill langhus-griffin, now back home after 8 years! yea! / yes, dreams really do come true!!

evonne & jessie, got my contact information on the website, called the ” nextdoor ” to find them a new hyundai kona… i went to work, success!

i contacted ken.. n. a few weeks ago after he offered his services to help others find the car they’re looking for. i let him know exactly what my husband and i were looking for, and true to his word, he was able to help us find a car in tempe. we were not looking for a vehicle with all the bells and whistles, but our main concern was getting a quality vehicle at a reasonable price, which we all know, has been difficult lately. it had been many years since we looked for a new car and we were so relieved to have found someone like kenneth who did his best to find us what we wanted. i highly recommend him, especially if you are hesitant to deal with dealerships and know what kind of car you want. he definitely saved us time and the hassle of visiting various dealerships throughout the valley! so appreciative of you, ken..                         


2013 dodge journey– another new customer by the name of alistair mackey, who resides in canada some of the time, & chandler, az in winter.                                             
good morning, alistair, i think i have found you the “right” vehicle for your requirements… it’s a 2012 dodge journey se, with 122k miles, and seems to be in excellent condition, from reading the carfax report (attached) i have spoken to the person at the dealership which is located in mesa on power rd. the selling price is $6995, plus sales tax, license plate, and doc fees. total cost $8424.59… if you like the vehicle, he will hold it for you till dec the 1st with a deposit of $1000… of course, you can pay for it in total… then it’s done… another option is you wait until you get here, and if you don’t take it, you lose the $1000, because they have taken it off of the market and could have sold it to another client… however, if you do take it, the balance due will be $7424.59. please let me know if you want me to tell them to hold it for you… i will provide you the salesman’s name, and address for you to over night your deposit. thanks, alistair, regards ken  mr alstair’s review of my services. he called me a rock star…! wow!!!   

my car buyer friends, bob & cindy patterson who have purchased at least 6/8 vehicles i just can’t remember…!
2023 chevy high-country
their card read as follows: ken bob and i want to thank you for all of your work that you put into helping us to find the ” perfect ” truck! you are so special to us, and we appreciate you and your friendship so much!!! cindy & bob…dreams do come true!!!  they shared with me that i had helped them with 8 vehicles over 28 years!      you just have to know the ” right  ” car-guy!                              
m-440i bmw hybrid for my client, mr jr of scottsdale, az.


2022 bmw m440i loaded
this client, mr. jr, who found me on my ” yelp ” business page… he had a older porsche hybrid, which he wanted to trade-in on a newer porsche. but he was in a lease, and was a lot of money up-side down on it… we worked with an old friend that i use to work with when i just got started in the car business, so i know him real well, way back in 1987. but it was not to be as my guy, kevin’s dealership didn’t have much inventory, and the dealership was marking up the cars, $25, to as high as $50,000 over msrp. with him being so up-side down on his vehicle, it just wasn’t possible to get his payment on the new one, and also it would require so much cash up front, jr just couldn’t make it work… so that is when, he ask me of i had a bmw contact in the valley, and i did have a good guy names jeff at chapman bmw in chandler, az… so i contacted jeff, and put him in touch with jeff, and just like magic, here is the bmw hybrid, that jeff made the deal happen for jr. so, again another happy client made possible by myself. i was so glad that it all came together                  

” ken’s food  for thoughts – i would love to hear yours, and experiences in doing business with me! “
hi there, it’s ken your car guy! i understand that finding the right vehicle can be an overwhelming task. it can be especially challenging to find someone trustworthy and comfortable to work with during the process. however, i am here to assist you. with over 36 years of experience in the industry, i have helped many people, including previous governors of arizona, professional athletes, movie stars, businesses, and families. i have developed long-lasting relationships with them, and they have become more like friends and family to me. many of my clients have returned to me, purchasing 4, 5, & even 6 vehicles over the years…
i am here to assist you and offer my help. the pre-owned vehicle market can be difficult to navigate, with some cars costing nearly as much as they did when they were new. now their may be a little relief, but we still need to shop for you. however, i can help you find the right car and the best deal. my clients have given me great reviews for going above and beyond in my work. i always strive to obtain the best discount on your behalf and find the best trade-in value for your current vehicle. in most cases, i can locate the vehicle you want, no matter where it is located in the united states. if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
i understand that the car business has changed a lot since i started in 1987, and i always try to sell cars at the best price for my customers. back then, i sold oldsmobile for $100 over the dealer invoice, but now, most dealers sell cars at msrp, the sticker price, and even $1000 to $10,000 over the sticker price. however, i will always make every effort to find you the vehicle you want and save you as much money as i can.
i recently helped a client save over $6000 when they purchased two ford mavericks. i have a referral letter from this client, thanking me for assisting them in finding the right truck at a much better price. this is how i conduct business, and i would be happy to assist you as well. if you have a vehicle in mind, please text me at 602-670-7569, mention your name and what you are searching for, and i will begin working for you. do you have some free time to talk on the phone, text, or chat?
buying vehicles is sometimes difficult, especially these days. it’s almost like going to the dentist for a root canal, pain so hard to bear, there you’ll also feel the pain in your wallet.  it doesn’t have to be like that, why expose to that?  you do have choices if you utilize my 36 years of experience and customer service and satisfaction.  with the kind of guidance that my customers, have become used to & appreciate especially nowadays…! 
i do all the research on your exact vehicle. just plan on including all hot buttons, & must-haves, and let me do all the searching and pricing on your behalf… some vehicles, do offer rebates, both retail, fleet and employee pricing, on approval with certificates or other verifiable information. as most of us know, rebates these days are nothing like the old days sorry to say. but it doesn’t hurt to ask, right?  free vehicle search, nationwide, if needed…! i will do the negotiating. if there is a discount to be had, i will get it for you..! i will provide you with a buyer’s order, showing you the dealer, the selling price, again, and discounts/rebates that i can get on your behalf. sales tax, for your state, lic & document fees. total-out-the-door! [sales tax differ depending your state of residence].    

who has the advantage when buying a car, “not you” yes in most case’s, it’s not you! but i am pretty sure that you know that, or i do think that most of my clients, are getting better prepared when heading out to meet your new salesman! yikes
if you’re planning to buy a car, it’s important to know that the dealer often has the advantage in the buying process. as a car auto consultant/ broker with 36 years of experience, i can guide you through the dos and don’ts of the process. i can also contact dealerships on your behalf so that they don’t get your name or number, which could limit my ability to help you. once you provide me with the details of the make, model, and must-have features, i will do all the shopping for you and find you the best price. i’ll send you a photo of the vehicle and a detailed buyer’s order showing the price, discounts, taxes, fees, and total amount. when you go to the dealership, you’ll have all the information you need to negotiate effectively. if you require any assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact me. i pride myself on providing exceptional service to my clients
you do the test drive! i’ll do the rest! let me straighten out all the curves in the road to your next car or truck!!! 
welcome, any of my clients! 
my location is: 3521 e gleneagle pl chandler, az. 85249
