facilities management
facilities management has approximately 140 (fte) employees and an operating budget exceeding $7.9 million to maintain 1,732,772 gross square feet of state supported facilities and approximately 265 acres. facilities management's mission is to provide a quality and safe environment for our customers and employees and demonstrate stewardship of the physical assets of the campus. additionally, facilities management is also responsible for providing non-maintenance services and improvements. as mandated in executive order 847, facilities management is required to be reimbursed the actual direct costs plus indirect costs associated with requested non-maintenance services provided.
