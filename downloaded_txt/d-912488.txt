herptile, n. 
a  completely   illegitimate term that has been used recently 
 in amateur  literature as a short-hand reference to reptiles and amphibians. 
 it is also  occasionally used in professional literature by authors who apparently
 lack  a classical background. --james a. peters
/             dictionary  of herpetology
