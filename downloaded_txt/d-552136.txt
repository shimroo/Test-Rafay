i took mark leader’s week-long course, the listing formula workshop at my brokers office. i have to say as a new agent this course was inspiring and super informative. the techniques that he teaches really helped build my confidence as a realtor. mark is also super engaging, so the class is fun which is a bonus. i would highly recommend this workshop to anyone. it is well worth the money.
