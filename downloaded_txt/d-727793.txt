when a distressed turtle found itself trapped in a sewer on sanibel island, both police officers and firefighters answered the call! after days with no way out, this little guy was finally saved thanks to the teamwork and dedication of first responders.
with officers securing the scene and firefighters lowering a team member into the drain, the rescue mission was a success‚Äîproving once again that our heroes serve and protect all members of the community!
üëè huge thanks to these officers and firefighters for their quick action and compassion!
