forth naturists swim club
 
the swim on the 5th january is cancelled due to predicted snow.
 
forth is one of several naturist clubs in scotland, with members of all ages living throughout the central belt and the scottish borders.
forth was formed in 1983 to enable members to enjoy a variety of activities, both indoors and outdoors, without clothing, while remaining within the law of the country.
we are now in our 41st year!
forth is a member of british naturism and we promote a genuine concept of the naturist movement to the public. new members are always welcome.
we have organized naturist swimming, also caravan and camping visits to other naturist clubs, bbqs, and beach visits, are also organized.
visitors are welcome to attend our swim venue without any obligation to join forth, with prior arrangement, which can be obtained by contacting the secretary. your first visit is half price.
what if you can't swim?  you can still come along and play nude badminton, or you might want to do some naked yoga.
if you are a regular, why not bring a friend for a half price first visit.
what have you got to lose but your inhibitions?
new year swim - the first swim in 2025 is sunday 19th january as the 5th jan swim is now cancelled.
 
agm notification: we are planning to hold our annual general meeting at the swim on 16th november 2025 at 5pm and all members will be invited to attend.  non-members will still be able to attend the swim when the agm takes place.
