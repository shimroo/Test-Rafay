   we are an arts collective working on environmental issues with a global, indy-media orientation.  most of the collaborators to date have been artists, but the composition of the teams working on each project differ.  consistent throughout, however, has been our concern about the mis-representation and trivialization of critical environmental problems by big media.  we feel that the commercially driven content and concentrated ownership has led to a chronic deficit of straight talk about problems whose solutions would require humanity to adopt different goals than those favored by corporate sponsors.
