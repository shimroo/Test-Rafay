centerline international




888.750.alfa



our goal at centerline international has been the same since 1978 - to provide the alfa romeo parts you need, offer the best customer service, have a little fun, and enjoy our own alfas. we offer the best quality parts and accessories at the best price - whether you own a classic alfa spider or gtv, a "modern classic" like the gtv/6 or milano, or a new 4c, giulia, stelvio, or tonale. we have extensive experience driving, maintaining, and modifying all alfas, so we know what works and what doesn't. sometimes cheaper is out there, but if we won't use a part on our car, we don't sell it to you for your car. and - we have the parts - most orders are shipped out the same day from our extensive stock of parts, not drop-shipped to you from a distant warehouse.
