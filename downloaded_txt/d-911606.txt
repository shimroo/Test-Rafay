 railroad preservation 

















 

   







    the mission of the rit model railroad club (ritmrc) is to promote the hobby of model railroading, to preserve railroad history, make new friends, and have fun. we do this through the development of working models and participating in the railroad community.


    we work with more than just trains, and welcome any rit community member who wishes to learn more about trains, building scale models, electronics, scenery effects, software, and more! we meet tuesdays at 8pm in sau 2520, but feel free to visit our layout in sau a420, across from the tech crew offices (detailed directions).


    we also hold work sessions on saturdays to work on our model railroad, the r&it. like us on facebook and check out our progress posts to see what we have been up to recently.


    if you'd like to support our club financially, we would appreciate it if you made a donation.
