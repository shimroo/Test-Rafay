private money lender



                                    we are an asset-based lender, and we portfolio all of our loans in-house. that means that our team originates, underwrites and services your loan from beginning to end. we are not brokers, and we do not require third-party approvals. this allows us the flexibility to make fast, common-sense lending decisions and provide you with exceptional service as a lending partner with a vested interest in your success.
                                

                                    as direct lenders, we are well capitalized, and capable of closing within 48 hours after receiving all required documents and underwriting approvals. our loans typically range from $100k - $1.5m with 3 to 18-month terms.
                                




for borrowers




unlike conventional banks, our asset-based loans are approved based on the after-repair-value (arv) of the borrower's real estate asset. we lend to borrowers or real estate investors who need highly-creative financial solutions or simply need to move fast.

                                




investors




our investors receive an 8% percent preferred return plus a profit split, with a historically high yield between 9% and 12%. loans made by the fund are secured by first deeds of trust in residential and commercial real estate, and are diversified over a variety of property types, borrowers and locations. click here for more info.
