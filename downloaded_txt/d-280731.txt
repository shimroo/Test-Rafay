what's next?
since beginning on our boundaryless journey to promote the passion and purpose driving
                        all we do, our faculty and students have been in the trenches tackling daunting global
                        issues like brain disease and decline, emerging conflicts worldwide, and population
                        research that aims to uncover and unravel inequality’s underpinnings. while we’ve
                        accomplished much in our pursuit to improve the human condition, there is endless
                        opportunity to do more.
in the uci school of social sciences, we’re taking a cue from our beautiful state
                        as we find inspiration in the natural brilliance of our uniquely california canvas—one
                        that’s emboldened generations of mold breakers to make waves, to reach higher, to
                        step up—to do better.
