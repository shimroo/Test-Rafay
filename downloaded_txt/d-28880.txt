this is a recent redacted 5 senses inspection report:
november 26, 2024
5 sense inspection report for redacted name
i have inspected random samples of 200 graphic novel collections owned by
redacted name 








          

  

 
the tactile experience of these graphic novels plays a significant role in how readers interact with the medium. several factors affect the "feel" of a book, including the sight, smell, touch and feel

sight

sight is the most immediate and engaging sense when inspecting anything, the medium is largely visual. these graphic novels were neatly placed in boxes away from the elements to prevent damage


sound
  not applicable

smell


the graphic novels still smell of fresh ink, with no musty odors

touch and feel

the graphic novels felt new, with no creases, rips or folds in the paper. upon visual inspection of random novels, i found them to be in pristine condition\

taste

not applicable

 
conclusion
the sensory experience of these graphic novels, when considering the touch/feel, smell, and sight components, easily earns a 10 out of 10. high-quality comics engage all the senses in a deeply immersive way. the paper, binding, and ink used in modern and vintage comics alike create a tactile sensation that enhances the reading experience. finally, the artwork, colours, typography, and layout make these graphic novels visually rich and dynamic therefore, based on all these factors, i would grade these graphic novels 10 out of 10 for their sensory appeal.

this is how we put the eric jordan methodology to work.
i want you to understand how and why the person with the experience of owning and operating a successful cobs bakery franchise or some other relevant business for 10 years is better qualified to be trained as a business valuator than a 20 year accountant.
on my website www.pin.ca it is easy for you to see the 25 factors that we use to determine intangible asset value, we have a proven methodology, and you can also see what a five senses inspection report looks like. we show you a redacted example of an inspection report. 
last week a franchise owner and his bank (rbc) chose the eric jordan â25 factors affecting business valuationâ process in combination with the eric jordan â5 senses inspection reportâ to produce a business valuation that can be accepted by the canada small business financing program. probably because i have a good working relationship with csbfp upper management. they look to me for advice and i have the email trail to prove it. every week it will be a different client and bank but the process is the same.we start where the accountants leave off. your accountant has for tax purposes taken all the measures legally allowed to reduce your tax burden. that is what accountants do and are good at. i am different and higher up the food chain for business valuation. i am a canadian personal property appraiser. (cppa) and a former auctioneer specializing in intangible assets. tax value doesnât matter in a real business valuation for a private company. âfair market valueâ is what is demanded under the canada income tax act, and they demand that intangible assets must be valued. there is a link to this information on my pin dot ca website.we start with the balance sheet and we see if you have everything there valued at todayâs  âfair market valueâ and the answer is no, but we fix that. in some cases we will have to do an asset valuation. you can find details under our heading debt restructuring and asset valuation. we are qualified to do this while accounting based valuators are generally not qualified to do this. i am qualified with a proven methodology to value intangible assets. accounting based valuators are using the old smoke and mirror methods. you can find more on that under our heading business valuation fraud and flaws to avoid. 
when we normalize the balance sheet as we are qualified to do we find out what capital needs to be left in the company and if there is redundant capital we identify it.the capital that needs to be left in the company is generally charged as a cost in the statement of profit and loss statement when we normalize the profit and loss.this is where we make sure everything the company does is at âfair market valueâ and that everything and everyone is paid fair market wages including the owner and family. sometimes owners overpay themselves and sometimes they underpay themselves and family. 
this is where the 10 years or more of relevant business owner operator âhands onâ experience comes into play. this work with the 25 factors and the inspection reports requires âhands on experienceâ(1) just like the captain on a commercial airline(2) the head surgeon in an operating room(3) the art restoration specialist restoring your million dollar family heirloom. 
your familyâs private business deserves the hands on experience of someone that has owned and operated a relevant private business for at least 10 years. this disqualifies most accountant valuators. 
this is where smoke and mirrors come in and we hear terms like âfree cash flow to ownerâ and ebitda.if you are spending $500,000 of your hard earned cash, you want to know the best estimate of what percentage of the $500,000 is going to come back to you as âprofitâ after everyone and everything in the business  is paid at âfair marketâ including taxes and fair market wages to the owner operator and family members. the real return on investment
âfree cash flow to ownerâ is not profit; but is a term scoundrels use to try to fool you into thinking this is the profit of the business. when in fact the business might be losing money if you or the current owner operator manager were paid âfair market valueâ wages for operating and managing the business. this is why i call them scoundrels.âebitdaâ is a term well accepted for public companies, but it is not appropriate for private companies and can be used by scoundrels to fool you into thinking the profit is very high when in fact that many not be true. not everyone using the term âebitdaâ is a scoundrel. sometimes they are just ignorant and find it convenient to stay that way. 
you should see now why the person with the experience of owning and operating a successful cobs bakery franchise or some other relevant business for 10 years is better qualified to be trained as a business valuator than a 20 year accountant.
who would you choose?

1. recognizing fair market value: a legal and practical foundation
business valuation is governed by legislation such as the income tax act in canada and similar laws in the us, uk, australia, and new zealand. these frameworks emphasize fair market value, which considers both tangible and intangible assets. learn more at pin.ca/fair-market-value.

the challenge: many appraisers focus primarily on hard assets like equipment and machinery, neglecting the intangibles that often account for the majority of a businessâs value.
the solution: the eric jordan methodology ensures that every aspect of a businessâboth tangible and intangible is identified, measured, and valued, resulting in a comprehensive, legally compliant valuation.

2. intangible assets: the real driver of value
research, such as the ocean tomo report, shows that 90% of the value of s&p 500 companies comes from intangible assets. this trend holds true for private businesses, where tangible assets typically play only a supporting role.

analogy: picture a vast underground parking lot. while it has intrinsic value, its true worth is only realized when paired with the 40-story building above and around it.
similarly, tangible assets derive much of their value from the intangible systems and relationships that surround them.


3. hands-on experience: the key to unlocking value
accurate valuations demand more than formulas; they require practical, relevant experience. the eric jordan methodology prioritizes hands-on expertise in recognizing, measuring, and valuing intangible assets, similar to other fields that depend on specialized knowledge.

the experience that matters most:eric jordan emphasizes the importance of 10 to 20 years of relevant business owner-operator experience. 
this experience ensures valuators understand the daily interplay between tangible and intangible assets and the practical realities of running a business. 
this type of hands-on insight is critical for identifying and valuing intangible assets effectively.

comparative insights:                            

a stradivarius violin is priceless, but only when played by a skilled musician.
a formula 1 car is powerful, but only with a capable driver.

just as art restoration specialists must understand every layer of a painting, airline pilots must master thousands of variables to ensure safe flights, and heart surgeons must rely on years of practice to perform life-saving operations, business valuators must have deep, relevant experience to identify intangible assets and assess their value accurately.

4. the role of the 5 senses inspection report
the 5 senses inspection report prevents fraud and adds a layer of accuracy and confidence by evaluating tangible assets through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. it ensures that the physical components of a business align with the intangible assets that drive its overall value.

5. why outdated methods fall short
the problem with traditional approaches:
the hard asset, market, and income approaches fail to account for the dominance of intangible assets.

hard assets alone are the smallest portion of a businessâs value and cannot reliably serve as the primary basis for valuation.
market comparison data for private sales lacks transparency, often obscuring whether a sale was fair market or influenced by factors like foreclosure, divorce, or other pressures.
the income approach fails without a methodology to quantify the intangible assets driving that income.


a modern solution for business sales:

internet platforms like google connect sellers with buyers effectively and affordably, bypassing the need for brokers and their hefty commissions.
a properly explained fair market value business valuation report replaces much of the work traditionally done by real estate agents.
after valuation specialists present the report to buyers, sellers can collaborate with lawyers to handle the remaining steps.

no smoke and mirrors are neededâthe valuation does the selling.

6. how the eric jordan methodology benefits you

accurate valuations: a comprehensive analysis of tangible and intangible assets ensures businesses are neither undervalued nor overvalued.
financing opportunities: the canada small business financing program accepts the eric jordan methodology for business and asset valuations. 
streamlined sales process: modern tools and detailed valuation reports empower sellers to achieve the best price with minimal costs.
clarity and confidence: tools like the 5 senses inspection report provide verification and insights, ensuring valuations are thorough, transparent, and reliable.

in loans of up to $500,000, up to $150,000 of intangible assets can be financed. 
weâre actively working with csbfp to increase this limit to reflect the real intangible asset portion in private businesses today.

valuations are based on canadian and international law 








my valuations are based on canadian and international law and are difficult to dismiss





understanding fair market value

fair market value (fmv) is a key concept in business valuation. itâs defined by several criteria:

highest price obtainable: this is the maximum value a business can realistically fetch.
open market: both the buyer and seller should have a full understanding of the relevant details about the business.
prudent parties: each party acts in their best interest.
arm's length: buyer and seller shouldnât have any personal relationship or conflict of interest.
expressed in terms of money: fmv is always given in monetary terms.
no compulsion: neither party should feel pressured or obligated to complete the sale.

one of the biggest issues with many valuations is the assumption of âno compulsion to act.â often, market valuations overlook cases where a seller may have been compelled to sell quickly (due to things like death, disease, divorce, or debt). this lack of transparency can make a valuation less reliable.
fmv in canadian law

canadaâs legal framework firmly supports fair market value standards. here are some key references:

income tax act (ita): section 248(1) defines fmv as âthe amount that a willing buyer would pay and a willing seller would accept, with no compulsion to act and both having a clear understanding of relevant facts.â
excise tax act (eta): section 69 aligns with this, stating that fmv is the price agreed upon by independent, knowledgeable parties.
special taxes act (sta): this section further supports fmv, stressing the importance of an âopen marketâ and informed participants.
canada revenue agency (cra): the craâs it-497r bulletin provides further guidance on determining fmv for both tangible and intangible assets.
canadian institute of chartered accountants (cica) handbook: chapter 12 offers a comprehensive view of fmv for financial reporting, covering both tangible and intangible assets.

intangible assets under canadian law
intangible assetsâthings like patents, brand value, and intellectual propertyâare a significant part of many businessesâ worth. canadian law recognizes their value and includes specific regulations:

income tax act (ita): section 248(1) acknowledges intangible assets as legal property.
excise tax act (eta): echoes the ita, recognizing intangible assets in valuations.
cra guidance: it-497r bulletin includes guidance on the valuation of intangible assets.
corporations act: section 2 defines intangible assets as âproperty,â making them a crucial part of fmv.

recent developments and their impact
recent legal changes have emphasized intangible assets, especially with updates to the personal property security act (ppsa) in provinces like bc and ontario. these changes have brought several benefits:

increased access to credit: intangible assets can now be used as collateral, opening doors for financing.
improved risk management: banks can consider intangible assets in loan assessments.
enhanced asset protection: registering under the ppsa gives lenders a claim on intangible assets, providing security in case of default.
streamlined transactions: the ppsa standardizes security processes for intangible assets, making financing easier.

the rise of intangible assets over four decades

intangible assets have steadily gained significance, now representing up to 90% of the value of us and canadian public companies. hereâs a quick look at this trend:

1975: intangible assets were only about 17% of market value.
2001: studies showed intangibles making up 70%.
2020: the ocean tomo report indicated that 90% of s&p 500 companiesâ market value was intangible.

these studies and shifts reflect changes in the modern economyâwhere knowledge, innovation, and brand value play a dominant role in shaping a companyâs worth.
the importance of experience

the eric jordan â25 factors affecting business valuationâ methodology is backed by years of experience. hereâs why this hands-on approach matters:

comprehensive analysis: the 25 factors cover a full range of elements that affect both tangible and intangible assets.
reducing bias: a structured, transparent approach promotes consistency.
defensibility: a clear methodology makes it easier to communicate valuation results with stakeholders.

why business ownership experience is key
experienced business owners bring intuition and insight that canât be taught. theyâve seen first-hand how market dynamics, customer needs, and intangible factors impact value. this experience means they can identify and measure the intangible elements that drive a businessâs success.
the power of combining methodology with real experience
the eric jordan methodology provides a structured foundation. when paired with the experience of a seasoned business owner, it creates a comprehensive approach to valuationâparticularly useful in cases where intangible assets make up a large part of the value.

								    intangible asset percentage â the "secret chart" key to business value 
understand why intangible assets make up the majority of a business's value and how to identify them.

									

close content


intangible asset specialist 






the parameters for business valuations have fundamentally changed

									the chart shows us that 90% of business value is now made up of intangible assets.
									
									most valuators today have no methodology to measure intangible assets and generally ignore them or vaguely refer to them as âgoodwillâ (circa 1975 ) with no explanation as to what goodwill might be.
									
									our proprietary â25 factors affecting business valuationâ methodology identifies, measures, weighs, and values 100% of company assets as required to be compliant with the canada income tax act.
									
									25 factors methodology is best described as a venture capitalist style business valuation.

business expropriation



expropriation



														for a business: expropriation ends your lease. ending the lease crushes your intangible assets which is likely to be 50% to 90% of your business value. 
														most lawyers donât understand âintangible assetsâ and the expropriation people are not going to give proper value to your major assets which are âintangibleâ and you could easily be cheated. 
														there is an old saying âit is not so much about the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dogâ and we believe that is especially true with lawyers and expropriation cases.
													

(1) the first thing we will do is evaluate your business and give it a value with the lease in place.  
														(2) second, we will show what value is left after your lease is taken away. 



														here are some considerations:
													

														
														(1) your leasehold improvements worth $300,000 in your current location may have little value in a new location (if you can even find a new location where your business can be successful)
														(2) what is your ânormalized net incomeâ going to be worth in a new location? maybe nothing as there is no guarantee there will be any net income. 
														(2) what is your inventory going to be worth if it has to be liquidated, compared to what it was worth prior to expropriation?
														(3) even if you were able to find a new suitable lease what is your client base worth now? are they going to follow you? 
														(4) your brand, your marketing, and your advertising that is cumulative in nature could have a significantly different value in a now location.
														(5) fair market value
														using the definition of âfair market valueâ how much would someone be likely to pay for all of your tangible and intangible assets if they were under no pressure to buy and had reasonable knowledge of the facts? one of the facts would be that a potential buyer will know the lease is ending soon and that you have to sell. 
														if $5,500 per month was spent on a well thought out google ad campaign and that campaign administration for 3 months; what would that buyer profile likely be willing to pay and why? this is an added component to a regular business valuation. this is why if this component is added for expropriation purposes this sort of valuation is likely to cost $4,500 to $9,500
													


overview


														the information provided on expropriation in the english speaking provinces of canada, is based on a general understanding of the principles and practices of expropriation law as it applies in the particular province, rather than specific data from individual databases. the details shared are grounded in the overarching framework and legal principles that guide expropriation processes in canada, most are well-documented in public legal resources, statutes, and legal commentary. key sources typically include:
													

														the $524,840 valuation for redacted business name., as determined by the eric jordan "25 factors affecting business valuation" methodology, is supported by the bc expropriation act's comprehensive approach to compensation. this approach not only covers the market value of tangible assets but also acknowledges the significant impact of intangible assets and other losses directly attributable to the expropriation. presenting a detailed valuation that encompasses these aspects, grounded in the act's principles, strengthens the case for achieving fair compensation for your client, redacted name.
														
provincial expropriation act: this is the primary legal document that outlines the process, principles, and entitlements related to expropriation in a province. it provides the legal basis for compensation, including the valuation of both tangible and intangible assets, disturbance damages, and other compensable losses.
														
legal texts and commentaries: scholarly articles, legal commentaries, and textbooks on canadian expropriation law offer insights into how the law is applied and interpreted, including precedents that shape the understanding of fair compensation and valuation methodologies.
														
government publications: documents and guides published by the individual provincial governments or related authorities can provide guidance on the procedural aspects of expropriation and compensation.
														
judicial decisions: court rulings on expropriation cases in bc offer precedent on how the law is applied, including how compensation is determined and what factors are considered in valuation.
														
professional guidelines: publications and guidelines from professional bodies related to valuation, real estate, and legal practice in the province can offer insights into standard practices for assessing the value of expropriated properties and businesses.
														the principles and practices described are well established in the field of expropriation law in the province and are supported by these types of authoritative sources. for the most accurate and up-to-date information, consulting the actual texts of the provincial expropriation act, legal databases, and the latest judicial decisions would be recommended.
														recognition of intangible assets in expropriation cases, including goodwill, business losses, and other non-physical assets, is a well-established principle in canadian law, including provincial law.
														
													


														general principle
													

														in canadian expropriation law, compensation for the loss of intangible assets such as goodwill, business interruption, or loss of potential future profit is recognized, especially when these losses directly result from the expropriation. the courts have acknowledged that the value of a business is not solely in its physical assets but also in its ability to generate income, its customer relationships, its place in the market, and other intangible factors.
						
													

														cases and precedents
													

tsawwassen golf & country club v. south coast british columbia transportation authority (2013 bcsc 239): this is an example of a case where the issue of compensation, including for intangible losses, was significant. while primarily focused on land value and improvements, the principles discussed are relevant to the broader conversation about compensation for loss.
														southam inc. v. surrey (city) [1990] 2 s.c.r. 695: this supreme court of canada decision, although not from bc, has been influential across canada, including bc. it addressed the issue of business losses and the recognition of intangible assets in the context of expropriation.
													

														legal framework
													

														the legal framework for considering intangible assets in expropriation of a province is rooted in the expropriation act and interpreted through court rulings. the act outlines the basis for compensation, which is intended to make the expropriated party whole, considering both tangible and intangible losses.
						
													


														free - give eric a call or an email to get a rough idea of what you might be entitled to and how to find a lawyer to represent your interests instead of their own.
														
													

														i will be happy to send a redacted report to clients to review.
													

														that old saying âit is not so much about the size of the dog in the fight but the size of
														 the fight in the dogâ in order to win in court you must have an interested lawyer 
														 who is willing to work with me and understand your valuation.

									business valuation fraud and flaws to avoid 
avoid outdated methods and uncover the risks of valuation fraud with our modern, experience-based approach.

fraud and major flaws you must avoid



case law - fraud and major flaws you must avoid





the copyrighted and proprietary  eric jordan â25 factors affecting business valuationâ methodology is strong and accurate. 
so accurate that when combined with our new in-house marketing methodology can expect to sell your business almost 100% of the time at or near 100% of our valuation price.
															(we have past and ongoing proof)


we solve
partnership disputes, divorce issues, purchase and sale values, share value, cra section 86 estate freeze, section 85 rollover.
														income valuations - expropriation
														


why our valuations work for clients and why others don't.

																
						
						
														  a business that can be financed is a business that can be sold.
																 
														we have many examples where clients using our valuation reports receive 85% financing at the lowest rates possible. not possible with most other valuation reports. 
														 



															there are major flaws in valuations produced by market approach, asset approach, or income approach.
															do you want to risk losing not only your valuation fee but also your court case?
															

(1) market approach is badly flawed



																		
																		i will lead with an example and how "market approach" could be harmful:
																		we recently did a business valuation required by rbc to finance a large well established restaurant and lounge in a large
																		canadian city. the sale price was $575,000 but the value we found was over a million dollars or almost double.
																		this happened because the seller was in a "forced sale position." this was not a "fair market value" sale.
						
						
																		this sale price data should never be used for a comparable sale but you can be sure this price data is being used and unscrupulous agents and buyers could use this and other data that is not "fair market value" to try and bully sellers into accepting below market offers.
						
						
																		fair market value definition:
																		the price expressed in money that a knowledgeable buyer and seller would agree upon with both parties having reasonable knowledge of the facts; acting in their own interests, and neither being under any pressure to buy or to sell.
																		 market approach
																		99% of the time when canadian business valuators use market approach in private company sales they rely on sale price data that should never be used. i have never, not even once found private sale price data to include any proof that the seller was not under pressure to sell. there are no doubt some cases, but which ones and what percentage? a valuator must be in compliance with the legal definition of "fair market value" regarding "neither buyer or seller being under pressure to buy or sell"
																		unless a valuator can reasonably prove the private seller is not under pressure to sell the data and comparable sale value must not be used under canadian and international law. 
						
						
																		 any business valuation report in canada or anywhere else that mentions "market approach" should be challenged because this is an accounting term from the1975 era and for the reason above is highly unreliable and subject to fraud and misrepresentation. 
						
																	



(2) asset approach is flawed and should never have been used from 2020 forward.

																
																any business valuation report in canada or anywhere else that mentions "asset approach" should be challenged because this is an accounting term from the 1975 era and is not a legally entrenched term in canada or anywhere else. tangible assets are entrenched in law but they are only a small percentage of the total assets of a business. for s&p 500 companies tangible assets are only 10% of value. 
																who would want their company valued based on 10% of the asset base. see ocean tomo report. 
						
						
																 brokers and others are almost always referring to balance sheet assets
																 they sometimes include "goodwill" meaning the value amount another business was purchased for, but there has in the past been no methodology to identify, measure, weight, or put a dollar value estimate on intangible assets, even when intangible assets regularly make up to ninety percent of private company value.
																the term "asset approach" is a made-up accounting term is not entrenched in canada or anywhere else for business valuation.
						
															

(3) income approach methodology was proven outdated and wrong in 2009 by mark d wiseman and the canadian pension plan fund valued skype at $300 million usd.



																
																canadian venture capitalist mark d wiseman, working with the canadian pension plan, valued a block of shares of a company that had financial statements showing huge losses (skype), and purchased that block at $300 million usd. mark d wiseman was also instrumental in selling that same block of shares for well over a billion usd two years later. billion dollar canadian profit for the canada pension plan. 
																that day in 2009 was the day when accounting based valuators had their income approach methodology turned on its head. those valuators using income approach would have passed on the opportunity to make cpp a billion cdn.
																the eric jordan "25 factors affecting business valuation" methodology follows the venture capitalist model. 
																
(1) the hard asset approach to business valuation was proven wrong and outdated as hard assets are a very small percentage of the average company value and especially by 2020. skype had few hard assets.
						
																 (2) the income approach to business valuation they used was proven not well supported, misleading, and wildly inaccurate. skype had negative income.
						
																(3) the market approach to business valuation shows valuators even today (2023) are relying mainly on unverified, inadequate, incomplete, and misleading private company sale data.
						
															



proof of concept is flaw four; missing for others

																we show what this is on our main website www.pin.ca


we have it and they don't
													valuations so accurate they can reveal
													who would buy your business
													even when it is not for sale.
														unique accurate, and confirmed by ai


						
																our valuations, in many cases, can identify the profile of the entity
																who would buy your business, the process of finding that profile, and
																an estimate of how long and how much it would cost to find them.
															




														 misleading and fraudulent valuations are a major concern
														
														98% of accountants do not do business valuations and are trustworthy.
														 the problem is within the 2% who think they are qualified to do business valuations without adequate small business experience, methodology and perhaps lacking professional judgement. then there are business brokers and real estate agents.
														
														suspected fraud example in 2023:
														my valuation report was for $2.7 million
														the client wanted a lower number that i could not honestly provide
														
														the client then went "appraisal shopping" and found someone "certified" willing to use incomplete and outdated market, hard asset, and income approaches from the 1970's to find a value 38.19% lower than mine.
														
														is this fraud if presented to the partner or ex wife in isolation while hiding the existence of my valuation?
														
you can see the problem.
														 if you are in a divorce or partner situation, or you want to buy a business, you may want to have this done right the first time.

														people need to keep in mind how little is recovered in liquidation so deals should be negotiated knowing that liquidation really is not in anyoneâs interest. 
														
														debt restructuring is the process by which a debtor (usually a small business) and its creditors renegotiate the terms of the debt. the principal amount outstanding may be lowered, the repayment time may be extended, or the interest rate may be changed. making debt obligations more bearable is the aim of debt restructuring, which aids the debtor in regaining financial stability.

this is the text version of a podcast we did for canada business valuation questions and answers.

sage: welcome to another episode of 'business valuation insights.' today, we're diving into the top questions people have about business valuation and appraisal. and who better to answer them than eric jordan, cppa and founder of the '25 factors affecting business valuation' methodology. eric, thanks for joining us! 
eric: thanks for doing this, sage. excited to tackle these questions and hopefully clear up what goes into valuing a business accurately. 
    
sage: alright, letâs get right to it. first question: how much is my business worth? 
eric: great starting point! send me a message, and within 15 minutes of our first conversation, i can usually give you a ballpark estimate and a quote for a full valuation or appraisal. 
    
sage: quick and easy! hereâs another one: what experience should a business valuator have? 
eric: hands-on experience owning and operating a relevant business for 10 or 20 years. thatâs what it takes to understand and apply the '25 factors affecting business valuation' method that we use. itâs on my site, www.pin.ca, if anyone wants more details. 
    
sage: good to know! next up: how do i get a business appraisal? 
eric: same as beforeâreach out to me, and weâll get started. itâs simple. 
    
sage: whatâs the best way to find out the value of my business?

sage: perfect. and how can i find the fair market value of my business? 
eric: same answer. message me, and iâll help you determine that. 
    
sage: okay, letâs dig a bit deeper. who does business valuations near me?

sage: got it. how do i know if my business is worth selling?

podcast title: canada unveiled: natural resources and cultural legacy
chris: welcome to "canada unveiled," the podcast where we explore the stories that shape our nation. i'm chris, and joining me in conversation today is eric jordan, a canadian personal property appraiser and a passionate storyteller about canada's rich heritage. welcome, eric!
eric: thanks for the conversation, chris. it's great to be here talking about what makes canada great.
chris: today, we're diving deep into canada's natural resources and how they've not only fueled our economy but also inspired our culture, music, and communities. there's so much to unpack.
eric: absolutely. canada is a land of vast resources, but what's truly fascinating is how these resources intertwine with the lives of everyday canadians.
chris: let's start with one of our most significant resourcesâuranium. saskatchewan's athabasca basin is world-renowned, isn't it?
eric: it sure is. the athabasca basin, near towns like saskatoon and la ronge, holds about 15% of the world's uranium resources. the uranium mined there is some of the highest grade found anywhere on the planet.
chris: and it's not just about extraction. this uranium plays a crucial role in global nuclear energy, powering homes and industries worldwide.
eric: that's right. it's a prime example of how canada's resources have a global impact. the innovation and technology developed around uranium mining also showcase our commitment to sustainable and responsible resource management.
chris: speaking of energy, we can't overlook alberta's oil sands.
eric: indeed. places like fort mcmurray and cold lake are the heart of canada's oil industry. with about 10% of the world's proven oil reserves, alberta is a powerhouse.
chris: advanced extraction techniques have really pushed the industry forward, balancing economic growth with environmental concerns.
eric: exactly. it's about finding that sweet spot where we can support communities economically while preserving the environment for future generations.
chris: moving west to british columbia, natural gas is another significant player.
eric: yes, towns like grande prairie in alberta and fort st. john in bc are hubs for natural gas production. canada contributes about 4% to the global production, which is impressive given we hold only about 1% of the world's reserves.
chris: it's fascinating how efficient infrastructure and technology can amplify our contribution on the world stage.
eric: absolutely. and the extensive pipeline networks we have ensure that natural gas reliably reaches both domestic and international markets.
chris: now, let's talk about something that's been gaining attentionârare earth elements in saskatchewan.
eric: the saskatchewan research council in saskatoon has established north america's first rare earth processing facility. this positions canada as a leader in supplying these critical minerals essential for modern technologies like smartphones and electric vehicles.
chris: that's a significant step, especially as the world shifts towards more advanced tech and green energy solutions.
eric: precisely. and speaking of green energy, lithium exploration in places like snow lake, manitoba, is another exciting development.
chris: snow lake resources is making strides, right?
eric: they are. with about 60,000 acres dedicated to lithium exploration, canada is bolstering the supply chain for electric vehicles across north america.
chris: it's encouraging to see these initiatives pushing us towards a more sustainable future.
eric: agreed. and it's not just about mining; it's about comprehensive development that includes environmental stewardship.
chris: let's shift gears to fishing, a resource that's both economic and deeply cultural, especially in atlantic canada.
eric: fishing is the lifeblood of many coastal communities. from lobster fisheries in nova scotia to salmon runs in british columbia, it supports thousands of jobs and has a profound cultural significance.
chris: the traditions passed down through generations are captured beautifully in music. i'm reminded of the rankin family's song, "the fisherman's son."
eric: yes! that song really encapsulates the challenges and pride of life in the fishing industry. it tells the story of generational knowledge and the deep connection to the sea.
chris: and speaking of music, we can't forget stompinâ tom connors. his songs like "tillsonburg" and "bud the spud" highlight everyday canadians and their work.
eric: stompin' tom had a unique way of turning ordinary stories into national anthems. "tillsonburg" brings to life the toil of tobacco farmers in ontario, while "bud the spud" celebrates the role of truckers in moving our resources to market. stompinâ tom did the intro song for a popular canadian tv series called âmarketplace.â
chris: it's amazing how music reflects and amplifies the stories of our resource industries.
eric: absolutely. and then there's rita macneil's "working man," a powerful tribute to the coal miners of nova scotia.
chris: her voice captures the strength and resilience of those communities.
eric: she gives a voice to the hardships and the sense of camaraderie among workers, which is a common thread in resource towns.
chris: on the topic of community and pride, let's talk about the trail smoke eaters.
eric: the smoke eaters are a legendary hockey team from trail, british columbia. their name itself reflects the town's smelting heritage. back in 1939 and 1961, they won the world ice hockey championships, putting a small canadian resource town on the global map.
chris: that's incredible. it shows how intertwined sports and industry can be in fostering community spirit.
eric: exactly. the team's success mirrored the hard work and determination of the town's residents, many of whom worked in the smelters by day and supported the team by night.
chris: moving on to renewable resources, canada's forestry industry is another pillar.
eric: indeed. we manage about 9% of the world's forests. sustainable practices in places like prince george and thunder bay ensure that we remain a leading exporter of softwood lumber, pulp, and paper.
chris: sustainability is key, especially with global concerns about deforestation.
eric: that's right. canada has some of the most stringent forest management policies, balancing economic needs with environmental protection.
chris: agriculture is another area where canada shines.
eric: i can still remember that wheat is still dangerous to store at moisture levels above 14.5 mc  i recall as a young guy being able to estimate fairly close the moisture level by sticking my arm in a container of wheat. from the vast wheat fields in saskatchewan to canola production in manitoba, our agricultural sector is robust. and let's not forget quebec's maple syrup, which accounts for about 71% of the world's supply. 
chris: can't imagine pancakes without it!
eric: neither can i. these products are staples not just in canada but around the world.
chris: as we look to the future, renewable energy is becoming increasingly important.
eric: absolutely. canada generates about 60% of its electricity from hydro sources. projects like the james bay project in quebec and the w.a.c. bennett dam in bc are monumental. where i grew up in manitoba there are, i believe 16 hydro generation stations. 
chris: plus, the growth of wind and solar energy in places like pincher creek and sarnia shows our commitment to diversifying energy sources.
eric: it's all about investing in sustainable infrastructure that will serve generations to come.
chris: eric, this has been an enlightening discussion. it's clear that canada's natural resources are deeply connected to our economy, culture, and identity.
eric: i couldn't agree more. it's the people behind these resourcesâthe workers, the communitiesâthat truly make canada remarkable. canadaâs intangible assets. 
chris: before we wrap up, any final thoughts?
eric: just that understanding our resources is crucial, but so is recognizing and celebrating the stories of those who bring them to us. it's a collective effort that defines who we are as a nation. i like to believe that my intangible asset methodology can help raise our standard of living. 
chris: well said. thank you so much for joining us today, eric.
eric: my pleasure, chris. thanks for having me.
chris: and thank you to our listeners for tuning into "canada unveiled." if you enjoyed today's episode, be sure to subscribe and share it with others. until next time!

immigration to canada and achieving a thriving workforce
chris: welcome to the chris and eric podcast, where we explore the strategies shaping the future of business and economic growth. todayâs episode is all about immigration to canada, a topic thatâs making waves across industries and communities. we believe your intangible asset understanding and how that relates to business valuation can help canada  achieve a 75% workforce participation rate by rethinking immigration, focusing on temporary workers, skilled refugees, andâhereâs the game-changerâbusiness immigrants who invest in canada and turning our temporary into entrepreneur and business owners. 
eric: thatâs right, chris. immigration to canada isnât just about population growth anymore. itâs about strategic, merit-based policies that solve labour shortages, boost the economy, and make our communities stronger. weâre going to break down how business investment and smart immigration strategies can transform canadaâs workforce.
segment 1: the vision for immigration to canada
chris: eric, letâs set the stage. why is a 75% workforce participation rate such a big deal for canada?
eric: great question, chris. right now, canadaâs participation rate is around 65%. that leaves a lot of untapped potential. by bringing in immigrants who can immediately contributeâlike skilled workers, refugees with in-demand expertise, and business investorsâwe can close that gap. think about it: more workers mean more gdp, stronger tax revenues, and better public services.
chris: so, weâre not just talking about filling gaps in the workforce; weâre talking about creating a thriving economic cycle.
eric: exactly. and hereâs where business immigrants come in. imagine someone immigrating to canada and purchasing a local businessâletâs say with less than 50% financing. theyâre not just creating jobs; theyâre revitalizing communities and keeping essential services running.for temporary workers and refugees the question we should be asking them is âwould you be interested in applying your skill or trade and owning a small business in canada?âonly take the ones who can prove they have a skill or trade and have a desire to have a business. these are the people we need. canada small business financing program should be encouraging these people in year 3 to be opening a business in canada and of course with a reliable pathway to residency and citizenship. 
segment 2: the how-to of immigration to canada
chris: letâs get into the nuts and bolts. how does canada achieve this kind of strategic immigration policy?
eric: first, we need to expand temporary worker programs. these programs fill critical gaps in industries like healthcare, agriculture, construction, and technology. but hereâs the kicker: they need clear pathways to residency. if youâve proven your value, you should have a straightforward path to become a permanent resident.
chris: that makes sense. and what about refugees? how do they fit into the plan?
eric: for refugees, itâs all about matching their skills with canadaâs labour market needs. healthcare professionals, engineers, tradespeopleâthese are the folks we need. by fast-tracking their residency and integration, we bring in people who are ready to contribute right away. and they should have an entrepreneurial spirit. 
chris: and the business investors?
eric: business immigrants are the game-changers, chris. by requiring less than 50% financing for business purchases, we ensure these immigrants are serious about contributing to canadaâs economy. they create jobs, stabilize local markets, and inject new energy into small businesses.
segment 3: challenges and opportunities
chris: this sounds incredible, but letâs talk about the challenges. whatâs standing in the way of this vision?
eric: there are a few hurdles. first, we need to make sure business immigrants have access to mentorship and community support. starting a business in a new country isnât easy. for temporary workers and refugees, integration programsâlike language training and skills matchingâare crucial.
chris: and what about over-reliance on temporary workers?
eric: thatâs a valid concern. pathways to residency solve that problem by keeping skilled workers in the country long-term. itâs all about balancing short-term needs with long-term stability. if they can have access to business start up loans, all the better. 
segment 4: why immigration to canada matters
chris: letâs wrap this up with the big picture. why is immigration to canada so critical right now?
eric: canada is at a turning point. with an aging population and labour shortages, we canât afford to sit back. strategic immigration policiesâfocused on business investment, skilled refugees, and temporary workersâare the key to sustaining our economy and improving our communities.
chris: and achieving a 75% workforce participation rate could add $200â$300 billion annually to our gdp. thatâs a game-changer.
eric: it is. and by prioritizing immigration to canada through smart policies, weâre not just solving todayâs problems; weâre building a stronger, more resilient future.
 
chris: thanks for tuning in to the chris and eric podcast. donât forget to like, share, and subscribeâand if youâre interested in learning more about immigration to canada, check out our website for resources and updates.
eric: letâs keep the conversation going. immigration isnât just a policyâitâs a solution. see you next time!
