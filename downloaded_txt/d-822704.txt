a catholic response
at catholic charities our faith is the foundation of everything we do. led by our shepherd, bishop michael f. burbidge of arlington, we use the principles of catholic social teaching to guide us in our response to serving the poor and vulnerable throughout our diocese.







serving the poor, lonely and vulnerable
we feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, heal the sick, welcome the newcomer, care for the elderly and visit the imprisoned because that is what jesus commanded us to do in the gospel. we serve all people in need, regardless of their faith.







lives transformed
at catholic charities our mission goes beyond offering temporary assistance to individuals and families in need.  bolstered by a dedicated professional staff and a broad corps of volunteers we strive, with god’s grace, to transform the lives of the people we serve.







support the mission
to serve and transform the lives of the men, women and families who come to catholic charities for assistance, we depend on the support of parishioners, neighbors and companies located within the 21 counties and seven cities that make up the diocese of arlington. support our work today!
