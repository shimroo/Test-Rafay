charter types


	bareboat charter
	the most popular and engaging of all our charter options is the bareboat charter. it is a perfect choice for people with some sailing skills who prefer planning out their own itinerary according to their interests. if you decide to go with our bareboat charter option you will enjoy complete passenger privacy on board, individual expense management by the passengers, as well as a free choice of anchorages, marinas, sailing duration etc. this is the most affordable type of boat charter. if you have a valid skippers' license and adequate knowledge of bareboating, you can enjoy an active sailing holiday in croatia, greece, turkey, italy or in any other country where your license is valid and we have yachts to offer for charter.
	skippered charter
skippered charter in croatia is also highly sought after for renting sailing yachts, catamarans and motor boats. you can choose any boat in our yacht charter offer and hire a skipper who will be responsible for the maneuvering of the yacht. the skipper/captain that you want to hire has all the required licenses and nautical skills, as well as good communication skills and a friendly attitude towards guests or passengers. in accordance to your wishes and weather conditions, he will make the best decisions for itinerary, routes, anchorages, etc. renting a skippered boat in croatia can be a great choice for a casual, relaxing and carefree sailing vacation.
	crewed charter
crewed charter in croatia is the most personalised form of yacht charter, which applies to gulet charter and luxury motor yachts rentals. it is one of the most comfortable and enjoyable types of holiday you can spend in the adriatic, fully organised according to a client's desires and preferences. due to the fact that a complete crew (captain, steward, cook) are on board 24 hours a day, guests are provided with a full service at any time. you can choose between half-board, full-board or an all inclusive service, according to your food type preferences as well as any other specific requests you might have. more about crewed gulet charter in croatia... 

charter bases


	yacht-rent offers 3.849 boats in yacht charter croatia, that are available for rent along the entire croatian coast and islands. here you can easily find, book and rent all types of available vessels in croatia but also vessels for yacht charter in greece, turkey, italy as well as yacht rentals in malta, france or spain. yacht charter offer in croatia includes open boats for daily trips, small boats with 1 to 3 cabins, large boats with 4 to 6 cabins and luxury yachts with accommodation for more than 12 persons. a large selection of sailboats and catamarans for yacht charter makes croatia an excellent place for sailing and vacation on boat. you can rent a sailing yacht in croatia as bareboat or skippered. if you decide to rent a catamaran in croatia, you will enjoy the combination of sailing and comfort. those who prefer speed or cruising will be pleased with a surprisingly large offer of motor boats available for charter in croatia. renting powerboats allows you to see as much as possible of the croatian coast and islands. finally, the gulet and motorsailer charter in croatia completes this nautical offer providing you with a nice and relaxing holiday on our coast. all special offers and extra discounts can be found here.
	basically we offer the same types of vessels for charter from other mediterranean destinations and from the caribbean as well. you can charter a catamaran in greece, rent a sailboat in turkey, skippered sailing yacht in italy or even hire a beautiful luxury yacht with crew from france. you can experience all of this here with us!
	one of the special segments of our charter service is cabin charter on cruises with predetermined cruising routes whether on large or small cruiser ships or on a yacht accommodating less guests, but providing privacy and a more intimate environment.
yacht charter available in the adriatic is ideally positioned for the finest sailing experience through all renowned areas and recommended places via proposed routes along the croatian coastline. most popular charter bases and sailing areas in croatia are the following regions: pula, rijeka, zadar, sibenik, split and dubrovnik. boat rental is possible in any of the thirty marinas in croatia, where we offer our yacht rental services. all charter bases in croatia are well connected to the largest european cities, making it easy to realise your croatian sailing holidays.
	since a significant part of the mediterranean is in the european union, this makes its destinations easily accessible to visit. it is easier to rent a boat in coastal destinations like greece, italy, france and spain, while for island destinations like malta, sicily, sardinia and crete you need to travel further. but whether the departure base is in a large city centre, such as renting a boat from athens, or one of the islands (dodecanese, cyclades, sporades or even the caribbean), you will receive a uniform service because our partners adhere to standards that apply to chartering in the world. 

cruises


	everyone can enjoy the cruise regardless of the nautical skills they possess. you can easily choose a cabin for rent on one of our cruise ships that sail on predetermined routes and departure dates. most often such cruises last a week, but there are also shorter cruises lasting 3 days for those who have less time available. the types of cruise ships available to us may be different.
	cruises on wooden ships
	we offer cruises on traditional wooden boats that can accommodate from approximately 20 to 40 people accommodated in cabins of two or three. on most of such wooden boats, each cabin has its own private bathroom with toilet and shower, and on the cheaper ones, there is at least a hand basin in the cabin. sailing on a wooden ship certainly evokes the atmosphere of some ancient times when these same wooden ships carried passengers or precious cargo.
	cruises on modern vessels
	this type of cruise offers greater comfort and more content because the ships used are usually slightly larger and newer. the cabins are more spacious, and each must have its own private bathroom with toilet and shower. also the service on such cruises is richer. guests can choose between cabins on the lower and upper decks, and on luxury cruisers there are vip cabins with their own private balconies where you can relax and enjoy the sailing.
