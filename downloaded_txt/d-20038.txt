articles by j.r. nyquist       
note: i am placing my new articles on a site which is easier to manage. the new site is jrnyquist.blog or jrnyquist.wordpress.com - the reason for a new site and platform is because the software running this site is getting rather old, but i do not wish to abandon the content because the site is old. there is more here than what i have linked because years ago all the links on the site broke for reasons unknown. there are many articles, besides these, floating around under jrnyquist.com. the site is actually very large and has been attacked in the past. other sites of mine were taken down after someone in china hacked them. if anything should happen to my new site, return here for further information.
(i will post links to new material here)

swallowed by the swampcommentary for 29 may 2017
watching the trump administration is more and more like watching a funeral procession. the republic is dead and there follows a parade of fifty hearses for fifty states. so many obituaries, so many political death notices. "dearly beloved, we are gathered here together to honor the memory of president donald trump, who was.... well, what was he?" we are not sure. but now, of course, he is a poltical corpse (like the country itself).

misreading putincommentary for 3 april 2017
ann coulter has compared russian president vladimir putin to former nationalist chinese leader chiang kai-shek and south vietnam’s president ngo dinh diem. christopher caldwell, of the weekly standard, likened putin to ataturk. in making these comparisons, coulter and caldwell reveal their ignorance; for putin is not a nationalist, neither is he anti-communist. he was, by his own admission, a communist by choice. as the russian president admitted last year, “i’ve always liked communist and socialist ideas.” [read more here]

golitsyn's methodologyand the trump administrationcommentary for 20 february 2017
 
what would anatoliy golitsyn, the kgb defector who correctly anticipated the fake collapse of communism, say about the trump administration? i believe he would say that the communist strategists have launched a new provocation based upon a supposed split between the communist-dominated u.s. democratic party and (soviet) russia.

intelligent discussion - update brazil
readers of this blog are encouraged to watch update brazil. it is dedicated to brilliant guests and intelligent discussion. i want to thank the kind folks at the tfp forum, http://thefinalphase.proboards.com/, for contributing to help fix my computer problems related to the broadcasts. i’ve been lucky to have a great run of guests since thanksgiving. on dec 3 we discussed the presidential   transition with trevor loudon, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xorw2ujo_9g; we interviewed the ever fascinating robin eubanks of www.invisibleserfscollar.com to talk about our sovietized education system, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojcnqtqkqjo, we had a great talk with political analyst william r. hawkins, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyis2xoysgy, diana west came on to talk about fake news. professor brian kennedy talked about the controversies of the transition process, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mftk5wjhswo; dr. peter vincent pry presented masterful insights on our national security culture, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrvcrutzfci; nevin gussack discussed nationalism as the foundation of policy, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj3daqhmzeq, diana west came back to discuss pizza gate and the “revolt of the left,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yql1rs2epk, and jim simpson joined us last saturday to discuss the ongoing constitutional crisis over trump’s national security policy and an absolutely devastating critique of karl marx and his works, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg_8crghl30.
i would also like to acknowledge nevin gussack’s piece on america’s survival, http://americasurvival.org/2016/05/rts-bryan-mcdonald-attacks-cliff-kincaid-of-americas-survival-and-j-r-nyquist.html#axzz4ywlbwjtz, in which he defended the book red jihad (which i wrote together with cliff kincaid last year). it seems i was attacked by bryan mcdonald of rt – a shadowy pro-moscow figure, who claimed i was “one of those ‘senior fellow’ chaps who decorate various american lobby groups, think tanks….” nevin set the man straight; https://www.rt.com/op-edge/341523-jihad-russia-israel-us-communists/ -- yes, its interesting to see that someone thought the book had to be debunked.

from a muslim readercommentary for 16 january 2017
i received an interesting letter from a former islamist in germany. he liked my new book, der tor und sein widersacher: die metaphysik des bösen (which, if i can find a publisher, may soon appear in english as the fool and his enemy). i have received several friendly emails from muslims in the past, but this one merited a special response. my muslim correspondent wrote as follows: "in my youth i was involved with many islamic currents and was a true-believing jihadist and a leading al qaeda propagandist in germany for about a year."
he does not say exactly why, but writes of a change of heart as follows: "being led to a long self-critical analysis of this [islamist] ideology, i left it behind and wanted from conviction to make a contribution to the security of [germany]." [read more]

a warning from abroadcommentary for 29 november 2016
the foreigner leaned toward his american contact. “this is of the greatest possible importance and urgency,” he said quietly. the american was perhaps surprised. what was this all about, he wondered. the foreigner said, “this is about the efforts of the green party’s candidate, jill stein, to conduct a recount, audit, and ‘reconciliation’ of presidential election results and voter records in wisconsin, pennsylvania, and michigan, with the probable aim of either overturning the results or bringing their legitimacy, and that of the next u.s. president, into serious public doubt.” (read more)

 will the real russian puppet please stand up?! commentary for 26 october 2016
i flatly state that marx was consciously an intellectual swindler for the purpose of maintaining an ideology that would permit him to support violent action against human beings with a show of moral indignation.                 – eric voegelin, autobiographical reflections, [pp. 48]
those who are familiar with the workings of the communists are aware that the united states is in jeopardy. they are not fearful if the people of the country awake to the danger. but the enemies of civilization, both those in the communist party and those on the fringe, who are playing with fire in their support of communist theories, are at work to effect the overthrow of the government. they are working cleverly, insidiously, and are willing to take plenty of time to accomplish their ends, but their main purpose, the goal toward which they are striving, is the destruction of church,  home, and the state in america and the raising of the dictatorship of the proletariat, controlled by zinoviev and his gang in moscow, to take the place of the government of the united states.                    – r.m. witney, reds in america, 1924, [p. 54]
 back in 1924 radicals and russian agents were working to replace the united states government with a cabal “controlled by zinoviev and his gang in moscow….” today that gang is nominally controlled by vladimir putin. and according to hillary clinton, speaking during the last presidential debate, donald trump is putin’s guy. she called the republican candidate for president a “russian puppet.” in reply mr. trump said to clinton, “no, you’re the russian puppet.” [read more]

provokatsiyacommentary for 16 october 2016
the final warp and woof of moscow’s strategic tapestry is now coming into view. as john dziak pointed out in his essay, “soviet deception: the organizational and operational tradition,” the key russian strategic concepts include: proniknovenniye (penetration), provokatsiya (provocation), fabrikatsiya (fabrication), diversiya (diversion), agent po vliyaniyu/agent vliyaniye (agent of influence), dezinformatsiya (disinformation), kombinatsiya (combination).  
the weave is thus translated if we juxtapose the following proper and improper nouns: barack obama (proniknovenniye), aleppo, syria (provokatsiya), donald trump/russian stooge (fabrikatsiya), russian hackers (diversiya), hillary clinton (agent po vliyaniyu/agent vliyaniye), cnn/new york times/washington post, et alia (dezinformatsiya), the result of the 2016 presidential election in all the above (kombinatsiya).

the last wordcommentary for 9 october 2016
by j.r. nyquist

the problem today is that people are so monstrously self-centered that they are incapable of viewing themselves as anything other than the sole [beneficiaries] and culmination of history when in fact we are all just bricks in the road of time that stretches in front of us. everyone has been taught that every single person is born for earthly glory, fame and riches, and anything that falls short of that just can't be right and certainly can't be god's will. i have had, on more than one occasion, christian people say to me with a completely straight face, 'what purpose can a person serve and what good can they do if they're dead?'
-ann barnhardt
 
to clarify barnhardt’s statement, especially with regard to many of our elected officials: “what purpose can they serve, and what good can they do if they’re alive?” if the chief objective is to live, and to gain a high office, then what happens to the truth? for the politician must tell the voter what he wants to hear. in that event, if the politician lives and thrives and gains high office – what wins?
