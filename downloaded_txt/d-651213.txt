manual.  

this is an actual written "boiler plate" safety
and health program manual that includes your company name! 










what does our basic safety program manual
consist of ?

it has the safety topics
that every thorough "safety and health program" manual should
include.

|==>please click here to
order<==|  





the basic, 69 page safety manual, covers only those
	issues common to all
	businesses


 you may
	need to address
	more, "job / site
	specific issues".










 for example, a roofing contractor may
	also need to address more issues than what's covered in the basic manual.
	

a
	roofer should also address fall protection, ladder safety, roof labor,
	

hand
	and power tools, back and lifting safety just to name a
	few. 









an incomplete safety manual,
	that doesn't address the obvious risks/hazards of your job, may
	be rejected.  

don't take this chance.  you may only have one shot
	at that contract.  

you certainly don't want to lose a contract by submitting
	an incomplete safety manual!  









 not sure of what you should add
	to the basic 69 page safety program
	manual?

 we have over 140
	different company site specific packages that includes the basic
	69 page manual  

plus 8 additional chapters for only
