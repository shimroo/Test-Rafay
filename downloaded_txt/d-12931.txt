life’s brighter under the sun
we acknowledge that sun life operates in many territories and treaties around the world. our global headquarters in toronto are on the traditional territory of the huron-wendat, anishnaabeg, haudenosaunee confederacy and the mississaugas of the credit first nations.

today, canada is still the home to many indigenous, first nations, inuit, and metis peoples from all across turtle island. we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in this territory. we offer this acknowledgment as a stepping stone towards honouring the original occupants, as a testimony to the oppression faced by indigenous peoples, and our commitment to indigenous communities and employees of sun life.
