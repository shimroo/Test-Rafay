tail-wagging testimonials















no regrets at all!!!!!
“today i went to pick my pups up and what an amazing experience.i got there and my pups didn’t want to run away!!! it means the world to me to see them happy and stress free!”- gabby r. 🐾











 i highly recommend this place for your pets!
“they go above and beyond to make sure your pets feel at home. they even sent my wife pictures of our fur babies to ease her mind. they get play time and people time and anything extra you may want to add on to your stay package such as baths, nail trimming, or even extra play time!”- neil v. 🐾











we can't recommend world class kennels enough! they're definitely the best! 
“we have 3 greyhounds and i'd say all three are somewhat high maintenance and require unique and individual care. our boy greyhound is blind. we use their pet taxi for pickup and drop off. emma and her entire team are caring, understanding, punctual, and go above and beyond to treat our four-legged babies as their own.”- holly o. 🐾











 wkc is truly an asset to any dog owner
“wkc went above and beyond when my family experienced a hardship due to a house fire. they looked after my pup linc and really took him in while we were out of our home, even making special accommodations for us to visit and play with linc while we were displaced.  they have helped turn a tragedy into a summer-like day camp for linc. i highly recommend to any dog owner who is looking to board, pet-sit, groom, or train their pup.”- sam d. 🐾
