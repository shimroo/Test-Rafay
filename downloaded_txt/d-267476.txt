﻿and long-lasting catalyzed finishes to ensure durability for your woodwork. contact our team today at

so far, anyone who’s walked into our kitchen says “wow” and the next thing they say is “ who made the cabinets ? “ and we’re happy to tell them. also, if you ever have a potential client and they need to see a job you did, we’d be happy to open our home and extend to them the same courtesy that was extended to us by your customer in upper montclair. when we left her house, we made our decision. our trip to your shop sealed it. ken, caldwell nj
