the columbia comprehensive epilepsy center is comprised of adult and pediatric epileptologists, along with an integrated team of other epilepsy specialists and trained healthcare professionals. the center is dedicated to the evaluation and care of adults, adolescents, and children with epilepsy, with the goal of helping patients gain control of seizures and optimize their quality of life. 
becoming a patientpatients may be referred to the columbia comprehensive epilepsy center by their primary care physician, adult or pediatric neurologist, or by self-referral.
multidisciplinary team of experts
our integrated, multidisciplinary team of specialists includes:

adult and pediatric epileptologists (specially-trained neurologists)
neurosurgeons
neuroradiologists
nurse practitioners
neuropsychologists and psychiatrists
electroencephalography (eeg) technicians

conditions we treat

epilepsy
generalized epilepsy
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
partial epilepsy
seizure disorder

we have particular expertise in serving patients with particularly complicated issues, such as:

difficult to control seizures
diagnostic uncertainty
children and adolescents with epilepsy
pregnancy and women’s health
mood or memory disorders

diagnostic services we offer
we offer a full complement of advanced diagnostic testing, including the center's inpatient adult and pediatric epilepsy monitoring units (emus), which combine video and electroencephalography (eeg) monitoring of patients to determine epilepsy type, frequency, and location of seizure onset in the brain. 
monitoring results are often supplemented by other diagnostic procedures, including mri, spect, and pet brain imaging, wada and evoked potential testing, as well as neurophysiological and neuropsychological evaluations.
we also provide in-depth evaluations for surgical treatment of epilepsy, as warranted, since approximately half of patients whose epilepsy is not controlled by medications are candidates for epilepsy surgery that could cure their seizures.
treatments we offer

anticonvulsant drugs
epilepsy surgery
intraoperative monitoring
modified atkins diet

pediatric epilepsy centercolumbia child neurology offers one of the top pediatric epilepsy programs both nationally and globally. our pediatric epileptologists receive a large number of referrals for children and adolescents with common and complex forms of epilepsy, including intractable seizures that cannot be controlled with medication. visit child neurology at columbiadoctors children’s health for more information.child neurology at columbiadoctors children’s health
