welcome to big canoe chapel
welcome! i am glad you have found our webpage, now let me tell you about what you might find if you click, look, and linger. behind the pictures, tabs, and icons, you will find faces, stories and evidence of our commitment to helping neighbor. you will see, on page after page, smiling faces of people who are finding big canoe chapel to be their place of belonging, discipleship, and service. after youâve seen all the energy and ministry of this website, i hope you come sunday and get to know us in a more personal way. we would surely welcome the chance to know you better.
dock hollingsworth, senior chaplain
