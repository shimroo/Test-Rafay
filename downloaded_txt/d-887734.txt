eco-friendlyyee-haw industrial letterpress operates with an environmentally low impact consciousness & has since day one. all kraft cardstock is 100% post consumer recycled in the south. most of our papers & all of our envelopes are converted from 100% recycled papers. yee-haw's primary paper source is a chlorine-free facility run by a family-owned us paper company that has been "green" for over 100 years. they use 100% clean, renewable hydroelectric energy that is produced at the mill. yee-haw recycles it's own "art trash" into one-of-a-kind products, and much of the ink used is repurposed from large printing facilities that donate their old inks to artists.
