forecast: 100% funshine!
 
sun, water, nature, and a whole lotta fun. the lake of the ozarks has been the midwest’s premier lake resort destination for decades. and it’s only getting more popular with every generation. we invented the phrase “something for everyone.” okay, if we didn’t, we should have. whether it’s boating, golfing, shopping, fishing, wave running, hiking, floating, or just good old-fashioned socializing—you can be as active, or not, as you wanna be. family, colleagues, friends, and even soon to be buds agree, there’s no better place to find your sunshine.

cut loose at the lake — just like grandma and grandpa did.
that's right, your sweet grandparents used to live wild and carefree at the lake before their days of slipping you hard candies and quarters when mom and dad aren't looking. and why not? the lake has been the place to hang out and be seen for as long as people discovered this amazing little piece of paradise. so, let loose and create your fun and memories for future generations. set your clock to lake time today!
 
plan your visit







































sun’s up. fun’s up! there’s no shortage of fun things to do during the daylight hours. whether you enjoy exploring and communing with nature, having family fun at a water park, or getting on the water in the vehicle of your choice, the possibilities are endless!


discover more fun under the moon than ever before. fine dining and sipping specialty drinks gets the evening started, then listening to live music and dancing the night away really shakes things up. be sure to visit one of the craft beer breweries, providing something for everyone to cheer about.
