are already sold out so please get your orders in

gentle spirit





gentle spirit,
down deep inside,
listening to natures song,
watching the clouds go by...





in the valley, full of life,
there is a stream,
bubbling and flowing free,
it makes me want to dream.



fond thoughts
        of days gone by.
moments that i held so dear.
faces of friends that i use to know,
where do all the good times go?





gentle spirit,
down deep inside,
trying to understand
why the years fly.



in the morning
        when i rise
there is a dream.
a dream that i think is real,
today is what it brings.






hopes i had long ago
        haunt me, 
still i
        can't let go.
a wish i made when i was young,
to this day its still the one.



gentle spirit,
down deep inside,
listening to natures song,
watching the clouds drift by...






in the valley, full of life
there is a stream,
bubbling and flowing free,
it makes me want to dream.
