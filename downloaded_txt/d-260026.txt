creating a website - fast and easy!
creating a website.  sounds 
        complicated, doesn't it?  it isn't.  you don't need to be a 
        techie or learn any type of complicated code either.  if you are 
        creating a website for the first time, bookmark this site.  it will 
        be really useful to you.  i tell you everything you need 
        to know and walk you through each step of the process - free!  
        
there are three main 
steps to creating a web site:
1.   
        get a 
        domain name - this page has everything you need to know about domain names 
        - what they are, why you need 
        one, how to choose a good one and how to get one.
2.  choose a web host 
        - this page explains what a web host is, how to choose a good one, and what 
        you really need and what you 
        don't so you don't get taken. 
        
3.  creating a web 
        site 
        - this page explains how you actually 
        build a website, what you should and should not put on it and helps you 
        figure out which website builder is for you.
creating a website is just the first step to having a 
        successful website.  i will also show you add-ons you can put on 
        your website like newsletters and counters for free or cheap, ways you 
        can make money from your website and how to get traffic to it.
why i created this website
i started this website for my friends and family 
        because i was tired of seeing them get ripped off when they were 
        creating a web site.  they either paid way too much (and thought it 
        was a good deal!) or got suckered into buying stuff they didn't need.  
        this was started for them, but i hope you find it 
        helpful too.   
so, let's get started creating a 
        website!  -->
