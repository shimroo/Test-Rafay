                  to place a bid, enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the work. artspace will accept a
                  bid at the next increment, and save any excess amount as a maximum bid. if you are outbid, we will
                  continue bid on your behalf up to your maximum bid.
                bid incrementsbidding increments increase at the following intervals:between $700 and $1,499: $200between $1,500 and $2,499: $300between $2,500 and $4,999: $500between $5,000 and $9,999: $1,000between $10,000 and $19,999: $2,000between $20,000 and $29,999: $3,000between $30,000 and $49,999: $4,000between $50,000 and $99,999: $5,000above $100,000: $10,000you will receive an email confirmation of your bid and when you are outbid. if you are the winning bidder, you will be contacted 48 hours after the close
                     of the auction.maximum bidding
                  every bid submitted is treated as a maximum bid. you should always bid the maximum you are willing to
                  spend for a work, though this does not necessarily mean you will pay that price. as the auction
                  unfolds, we will increase your bid by increments to ensure you remain the highest bidder. if the
                  winning amount is less than your maximum bid, you will pay the current increment. if your maximum
                  bid no longer exceeds the current bid, you will receive an outbid notification email, and have the
                  option to bid again.
                
                  in the case of multiple bidders placing the same maximum bid, the first person to place the maximum
                  amount takes precedence as the highest bid until another bidder exceeds the maximum amount.
