with your help, we can do incredible things. 







at new orleans habitat for humanity, we do more than build houses, we make communities stronger. and with your donation we’ll be able to do even more, including create home ownership programs and services that will teach new home owners basic home repair as well as financial literacy.

what was once old is now awesome. 



shop restore in-person or online. 



we want everyone to have access to affordable furniture, appliances, home goods, and construction materials. that’s why we’ve opened online stores for both of our restore locations in kenner and new orleans. just go online, check out the deals, get the items you want, and then pick them up at your convenience. it’s that easy.

imagine everything within walking distance. 



rising oaks. convenience planned. 



with the development of rising oaks, a planned community, first-time home buyers will have access to affordable homes as well as everything their families need, like healthcare, schools, childcare, jobs, retail, restaurants, critical services, and playgrounds – all within walking distance.
