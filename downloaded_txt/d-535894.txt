it is clear that somebody has it in for rachel reeves and the story about her cv and her past conduct continues to snowball, the allegations made in today’s times newspaper is a new addition to the allegations against her. for the first time i genuinely think she might be in trouble as the comments by her spokesman when these allegations were put to them didn’t contain an outright denial, although i may well be over parsing these comments a…
