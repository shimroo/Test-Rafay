  below is sam's petfinder page.  sam needs a foster home or a rescue.  the lady who rescued him off the street is in desperate need of help.  she's overloaded and managing all her rescues including this one and is getting more than difficult.  to add to the problems, a couple of days ago when sam was let out to do his business, two dogs jumped the fence and attacked him.  sam's condition upsets the dogs and they want to attack him also in his weakend state, so we're hoping for a safer, calmer environment for him.  if sam finds his forever home through our pleas we will use the adoption fee to vet him fully.  the fostermom has not been able to pull the money together for his shots and neuter.  not being neutered is another reason the other rescues are upset with sam.  his forever family will get a fully vetted dog.    if a foster or rescue comes forth to take sam in, silver rescue will donate a 50 lb bag of science diet dog food.   please help sam.  if you can, please contact rhonda boyce at pitty_lover@yahoo.com.  if you can't please crosspost.   thank you! karina silver rescuewww.silverrescue.petfinder.coma 501(c)(3) charitable organizationtax deductible contributions may bemade at to karinamcdaniel@aol.com at www.paypal.com --------------------------- sam  german shepherd dog, american staffordshire terrier [mix] large  young  male  dog  silver rescue, nashville, tn    click on thumbnailto enlarge           name: samage: 1.5 +/- yrs oldbreed: german shepherd dog/american staffordshire terriercolor: fawn with white accentsweight: 60-70 lbstemperament: gentle, sweet, very loyal; a little shy at first but trusts when he sees he's loved.obedience training: will be fully vetted and trained before he goes to his forever homemy name is sam and i am approximately 18 months old, male. i am very sweet and very loyal i will even sit for you if you ask me to. i think i am kind of handsome to! possible pit/shepherd mix. (hence the tall ears!) i was dumped off by previous owners who evidently did not have room for me in their life. i was very shy at first and it took awhile for me to come to the lady that takes care of me now. i warmed up to her and loved the yummy treats that she gave me and she loved my big brown eyes. she has a house full and cannot keep me but she is determined to find a great place for me. i hang around outside and she feeds me every night. she lets me come in when its cold and i haven't had any accidents! i even get along with all 4 of her dogs. sometimes i hide in the corner hoping no one will notice me and make me go back outside. i have dodged animal control twice already (god is looking out for me). people around the neighborhood have been mean to me because they are scared of me i guess and throw things at me so it takes me a minute to trust you but nothing a little sweet talk wont cure. i haven?t really been around kids to much but would probably be best with older kids. i would be a great protector for a single woman or couple. i am looking for an inside home with a fenced in yard so i can run and play. i love to play! . if a home is found for me the lady that looks out for me will help with shots and neutering. basically, i am a very sweet boy i just need someone to give me a chance. i have made it this long so i know its meant for me to find a great home.the adoption fee is $200 and will be used to obedience train sam with silver rescue's trainer when he is adopted.for an application contact, karinamcdaniel@aol.com or ronda boyce at pitty_lover@yahoo.com.

	 my own pit bull and chicks :d
	 
    


we have started to raise chickens... mostly fancy breeds, chocolate and blue egg layers :) halo loved when all of the babies hatched out of the eggs in the bator. he would run and check on them anytime there was a commotion in the brooder. :d he waits for me to say that we are going to see the chickies and he is all ready to go out to the coop (at my father-in-law's) he mostly just likes that he gets to run unleashed and play with fil's dogs.... but he also stops in at the coop from time to time to check the chickens out.this is halo with roxie, his favorite chook. she can do no wrong :) she is one of the original 2 chicks that we got in the spring and has senority over the others in halo's eyeshe has even run the other dogs off from the coop, letting them know that they are not to harm those chickens. now they keep a safe distance from the chooks and he knows that they will not harm them and all is well :) who'd have thunk he'd be such a good farm dog :) he never even had to issue more than a warning growl. then it was off to run and play with the same dog he said "get away from my chickens" to. he did good :)

	 bsl alert!!!! ohio trying to ban and destroy pit bulls!!!
	 



i do want to note this.... that existing section 955.11 of the revised code is hereby repealed. so apparently they have repealed this particular section and it no longer inscludes bsl. i am happy to this. if indeed this is true and the bsl has been removed from the bill, then i hope it passes  however, as a note, if it doesn't pass because of the confusion created by the original inclusion of bsl, i hope that their politicians have learned that it is best to do things right and not try to piggyback laws like that. it's a sad thing when very good legislation gets turned down because of the inclusion of something dubious... and even worse when dubious legislation is piggy-backed in on the backs of some wonderful legislation.ohio staterepresentative tyrone yates has proposed a bill today that would prohibit the ownership of “pit bulls” in the state of ohio. the bill requires all owners to surrender their "pit bulls" within 90 days of the effective date of the proposed law. the bill is unequivocal that the dog warden "shall" euthanize all “pit bulls” within 10 days of their surrender.also under this proposal a dog warden or other officer that has probable cause to believe that a dog is a “pit bull” dog, may apply for a search warrant. with the search warrant the officer will have the authority to seize the “pit bull” dog and surrender it to the dogwarden to be killed."read more about it here----> adbadogsee this section:sec. 955.111.  (a) beginning ninety days after the effective date of this section, no person shall own, keep, or harbor a dog that belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog. (b) not later than ninety days after the effective date of this section, a person who owns, keeps, or harbors a pit bull dog on the effective date of this section shall surrender the dog to the dog warden. not later than ten days after receiving the dog, the dog warden shall euthanize the dog. (c)(1) beginning ninety days after the effective date of this section, if an officer has probable cause to believe that a dog is a pit bull dog, the officer may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a search warrant. the court shall issue a search warrant for the purposes requested if there is probable cause to believe that a dog is a pit bull dog. (2) after obtaining a search warrant, an officer shall seize the pit bull dog and surrender the dog to the dog warden. not later than ten days after receiving the dog, the dog warden shall euthanize the dog. (d) as used in this section, "officer" has the same meaning as in section 959.132 of the revised code. section 2.  that existing section 955.11 of the revised code is hereby repealed. out of state individuals wishing to voice opposition:until we determine to which committee the bill has been assigned, if youwould like to voice your opposition, the best thing to do is to:(1)send letters to house leaders (contact info below) and voice youropposition.(2)call the leadership and leave messages voicing your opposition.leadership contact information:john hustedspeaker of the house77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 644-6008fax : (614) 719-3591email address: district37@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)kevin dewinespeaker pro tempore77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 644-6020fax : (614) 719-3970email address: district70@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)larry l. flowersmajority floor leader77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 466-4847fax : (614) 719-6958email address: district19@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)jim carmichaelassistant majority floor leader77 s. high st12th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 466-1474fax : (614) 719-0003email address: district03@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)michelle g. schneidermajority whip77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 644-6023fax : (614) 719-3589email address: district35@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)shannon jonesassistant majority whip77 s. high st11th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 644-6027fax : (614) 719-3967email address: district67@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)joyce beattyminority leader77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 466-5343fax : (614) 719-3581email address: district27@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)t. todd bookassistant minority leader77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 466-2124fax : (614) 719-6989email address: district89@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)fred strahornminority whip77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 466-2960fax : (614) 719-6940email address: district40@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)mike foleyassistant minority whip77 s. high st14th floorcolumbus, oh 43215-6111telephone: (614) 466-3350fax : (614) 719-3910email address: district14@ohr.state.oh.us (state.oh.us)

	 dog powered scooter
	 



dog powered scooter available at http://www.dogpoweredscooter.com/a great way to exercise your large breed dog or pit bull! what a great way to get out there and spend some quality time together all the while exercising your pit and taking advantage of that strength and pulling power :d i might get myself one of these some day when i have some spending money ;) i'm sure halo would just love this! he wants to be by my side 24/7 anyhow, this way i get something out of it too. not to mention that this keeps the dog at your side in a heel position allowing you to maintain the alpha role as pack leader. a great idea indeed!

now that summer is here and temps are heating up, there's no place the dogs love more than our bedroom! we have a window ac unit that keeps the room nice and cool on hot days. halo especially loves to lay in front of it on the comforter and chill. if he knows the air is on and he's not in the room he'll cry outside the door and stick his little paws thru the gap at the bottom begging to be let in. when the ac is not on he likes to hog all the cool air by laying right in front of the fan on the floor downstairs. he certainly knows how to make it thru summer.
