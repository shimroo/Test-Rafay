our storyearly in the 1950’s mr. joe robinson was encouraged by his wife, sara holmes robinson, to acquire the ornamental pattern collection of the antebellum janney iron works of montgomery. at first they began making pieces for friends but as interest in the items grew they realized they could market a more complete line through catalog sales. around 1974 their sons, joseph h. robinson, jr. and richard h. robinson, began the firm known as robinson iron specializing in architectural metalwork – restoration and custom casting. many innovations in metallurgy and foundry technology have occurred in the years since the company started operation. traditional manual labor is augmented with sophisticated computerized automation. however, many special skills used in patternmaking and finishing are being preserved and passed along to a new generation. the "old school" methods are still employed in wood working and in the creation of new ornamentation. most of robinson iron's employees are from alexander city or the greater lake martin area. our employees serve on local boards and committees of community organizations and the company contributes directly to fundraising efforts by agencies i.e., main street, gateway to education, etc. robinson iron's personnel includes a specialized mix of artists, craftsmen, engineers, foundrymen, fabricators and salespersons. their spirit of co-operation and determination to accomplish a client's goals are the hallmark of this family owned company. today a third generation of robinsons is helping to grow the company. luke s. robinson, as director of sales, represents the company at conference exhibitions and coordinates client requests on a daily basis. austin robinson is facilities and special projects manager and is responsible for the physical plant and field operations for specific projects.executive teamrichard robinsonpresidentconnectaustin robinsonplant managerconnectpaul spickardoperations managerconnectluke robinsonsales / marketing managerconnect
