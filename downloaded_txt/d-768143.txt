ponzi schemes 
posted on august 21, 2024 by claude wilson 


 

understanding ponzi schemes
소액결제현금화 a ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. these schemes are named after charles ponzi, who became infamous for using this method in the early 20th century. the crux of a ponzi scheme lies in its deceptive structure, where returns to earlier investors are paid from the contributions of newer investors, rather than from profit earned by the operation of a legitimate business.
the origin of ponzi schemes
charles ponzi, an italian immigrant to the united states, popularized the scheme in the 1920s, although the concept had been used by others before him. ponzi’s scheme involved arbitraging international reply coupons, which allowed senders of mail to pre-purchase postage for replies from the recipient. ponzi claimed he could generate massive profits through these coupons, promising returns of 50% in 45 days or 100% in 90 days. however, ponzi was not actually generating profits through his supposed business. instead, he used money from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, creating the illusion of a profitable enterprise.
how a ponzi scheme works
at the heart of a ponzi scheme is the illusion of a profitable business. typically, these schemes begin with a single individual or small group who promises high returns on investments. to entice investors, the scheme often boasts a track record of high returns, which are paid out to early investors. however, these returns do not come from profits earned by the scheme but rather from the capital contributed by new investors.
the pyramid structure of a ponzi scheme
a ponzi scheme operates much like a pyramid, where a small number of initial investors are at the top, and each new layer of investors supports the layer above it. as more people join the scheme, the pyramid grows, and the flow of money from new investors is used to pay returns to those above them. eventually, the scheme collapses when there are not enough new investors to sustain the payouts, leading to significant losses for most participants.
the role of early investors and later investors
early investors in a ponzi scheme may receive the promised returns, which can make the scheme appear legitimate. these investors often become unwitting promoters of the scheme, encouraging others to invest based on their own apparent success. however, as the scheme grows, the number of new investors needed to maintain payouts increases exponentially. late-stage investors are unlikely to see any return on their money, as the scheme eventually collapses under its own weight.
the false promise of high returns
one of the most attractive aspects of a ponzi scheme is the promise of high, guaranteed returns with little or no risk. this promise is usually the primary hook that draws investors in. however, these returns are unsustainable and are only possible through the continuous recruitment of new investors. once the flow of new money slows, the scheme quickly unravels, revealing the fraudulent nature of the operation.
key characteristics of ponzi schemes
to recognize and avoid ponzi schemes, it is essential to understand their key characteristics. these schemes often share several common traits that can serve as red flags for potential investors.
unrealistic returns
a hallmark of a ponzi scheme is the promise of high returns that seem too good to be true. legitimate investments rarely guarantee consistent high returns, especially in a short period. if an investment opportunity promises unusually high or guaranteed returns with little or no risk, it should be approached with caution.
lack of transparency
ponzi schemes typically operate with a lack of transparency. investors are often kept in the dark about how their money is being invested and how the promised returns are generated. the operation may use vague or complex language to describe the business model, making it difficult for investors to understand how the scheme works.
dependence on new investors
the success of a ponzi scheme depends entirely on the continuous recruitment of new investors. without new money coming in, the scheme cannot pay returns to earlier investors. this dependence on a constant influx of new participants is a key indicator of a ponzi scheme.
lack of legitimate business operations
unlike legitimate businesses, ponzi schemes do not generate profits through actual business activities. instead, they rely on the money from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors. often, the business model of a ponzi scheme is either non-existent or deliberately obscured to prevent investors from uncovering the fraud.
famous ponzi schemes in history
over the years, several ponzi schemes have made headlines due to the massive amounts of money involved and the devastating impact on investors. understanding these cases can provide valuable insights into how these schemes operate and the signs to watch out for.
the original ponzi scheme: charles ponzi
charles ponzi’s scheme in the 1920s is perhaps the most famous ponzi scheme in history. ponzi’s fraudulent activities were eventually uncovered, leading to his arrest and the collapse of his scheme. by the time the scheme unraveled, ponzi had defrauded investors of approximately $20 million, equivalent to about $260 million today.
bernie madoff’s $65 billion scam
one of the most notorious ponzi schemes in modern history was orchestrated by bernie madoff, a former chairman of nasdaq. madoff’s scheme, which lasted for decades, defrauded thousands of investors out of an estimated $65 billion. madoff’s fraud was discovered in 2008, leading to his arrest and subsequent conviction. the scale of madoff’s scheme and the length of time it operated make it one of the most significant financial frauds in history.
other notorious ponzi schemes
there have been many other ponzi schemes over the years, each with its unique features and devastating impact on investors. for example, the stanford financial group, led by allen stanford, was another major ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of over $7 billion. these cases highlight the ongoing threat posed by ponzi schemes and the need for vigilance by investors.
impact of ponzi schemes
the impact of ponzi schemes is far-reaching, affecting not only the direct victims but also the broader financial system. the consequences of these schemes can be devastating, leading to financial ruin for investors and legal consequences for those involved.
financial losses to investors
the most immediate and significant impact of a ponzi scheme is the financial loss suffered by investors. many victims lose their entire life savings, leaving them financially devastated. the losses can be particularly severe for late-stage investors, who often receive nothing when the scheme collapses.
legal consequences for perpetrators
those who orchestrate ponzi schemes face severe legal consequences if caught. in addition to lengthy prison sentences, perpetrators may be required to pay restitution to their victims. the legal system takes financial fraud seriously, and those involved in ponzi schemes can expect to face significant penalties.

five strategies for successful online marketing
successful online marketing : with the internet constantly evolving, it can be hard to keep up with the latest trends in online marketing. as a business owner or marketer, you need to stay on top of new techniques and strategies that can help you reach your target audience and drive more sales. there are many different approaches to online marketing, but some basic strategies remain the same regardless of what type of business you’re in. here are five key strategies for successful online marketing: 이상적인 남자 크기는 몇cm?
1. invest in quality content: quality content has become essential for any successful online marketing strategy. content should be informative, entertaining, and interesting enough that your readers will want to share it with their friends or colleagues. quality content will also help you build trust with potential customers by showcasing your expertise in a particular industry or topic area. investing time and resources into creating quality content is one of the best ways to attract new visitors to your website while also providing value for existing customers or subscribers.
2. utilize social media platforms: social media platforms such as facebook, twitter, instagram, pinterest and others have become hugely popular among consumers over the past decade – making them an important tool for any modern day digital marketer looking to reach their target audience quickly and effectively. not only do social media platforms allow businesses to engage directly with their customers through posts/updates/shares etc., but they also offer a great way of sharing fresh content such as blog posts or product updates – getting it seen by potentially thousands more people than just those subscribed directly on your mailing list!
3. optimize your website for seo purposes: organic search engine optimization (seo) is an integral part of any successful online marketing campaign – helping potential customers find relevant pages within websites when searching via google etc.. optimizing page titles & descriptions along with including targeted keywords throughout page content all helps improve rankings within search engine results pages (serps) which can significantly increase targeted web traffic over time! additionally utilizing ‘alt tags’ on images/videos within pages ensures they are correctly identified by search engines too which helps further improve visibility across serps – so make sure these are filled out when adding multimedia elements onto webpages!
4 build email subscriber lists: email newsletters remain one of the best ways for businesses large & small alike to send out regular updates about products/services offered as well as news about upcoming events etc.. building email lists is therefore highly important when looking at successful online marketing campaigns – although this process should never include sending unsolicited emails i.e., spamming potential customers who have not explicitly opted-in first! the most effective way around this issue is offering something free – such as discounts/promotional codes – upon signing up so that people feel rewarded & motivated enough when joining mailing lists rather than feeling like it’s just another chore… successful online marketing
5 analyze your results & adjust accordingly: as mentioned previously there are many different tactics available when embarking upon an online marketing campaign; however due diligence must always be taken into account before launching campaigns live – understanding how they may affect customer behavior both positively & negatively before pushing them out into public domain i..e testing adverts first using a/b split testing methods where two variations compete against each other before determining which performs better overall (based off metrics such as click-through rates). then once campaigns have been launched regularly analyzing performance data allows marketers adjust accordingly if needed e-g changing advert copy if certain words appear unsuccessful at converting potential leads into actual paying customers; thus ensuring campaigns perform optimally over time without needing drastic overhauls every few months…

mobile texas hold’em from ongame. sequel.
mobile texas hold’em : very crucial attribute at the mobile texas hold’em room is stats choice. you can check out best hands (online or offline mode), video game statistics (actual cash, play money, or offline events) and hand background. the game stats can be reset at any time – this will after that reset all the formerly saved information.
i wouldn’t specifically examine the network in its entirety or a specific mobile pokerroom, it has been currently done briefly in the “mobile poker room testimonials”.
below i shall transform our attention to the trouble of selection a specific mobile casino poker room to play. when it comes to me, i played in mobile pokerroom, because i have an account there, plus i intended to have a look at their mobile gambling establishment video games. i prefer to put it similar to this: if you are interested only in casino poker as such, and you don’t need a mobile casino or sportsbook then play in europoker, they focus on this game; they have incentives and also various online poker promotions. bwin is not that charitable in respect to the mobile casino site bonus offers, yet from one account you can dip into their mobile casino site along with place a wager the sportsbook.
pokerroom besides texas hold’em has also a casino (you can utilize a joint account), yet worth discussing, the mobile casinoroom provides now only one game – blackjack. the video game weighs a little bit less comparing to the other mobile casinos, – only 95 kb, graphics is good, yet a little bit too fine, possibly as a result of the truth that they use a video game as much as 5 boxes. i personally gave it a try as well as played simalteneously at two. the table limite is vast sufficient – $1-$300, i dipped into $3. the video game was fairly smooth, though instead frequently there were series of 3-5 victories or 3-5 losses. i obtained a document win collection – 12 wins in a row (and also 5 losses at maximum)! easy to think, i finished my play session with not bad jackpots. it resulted in 50 wins, 45 losses and also 5 connections. the blackjacks let me down only ones, yet with a dual downs was ok: won 8 out of 10. as you can think of, i appreciated that! among the most distinctive features of the mobile poker area is the capability for users to make deposits and also withdrawals to and from a real cash account through their mobile phone, in addition to transferring by means of moneybookers.
various other mobile texas hold’em rooms.
as i have actually currently discussed, there are few mobile texas hold’em rooms yet. factually, i could discover the details on the mobile casino poker at partypoker internet site, however they just have mobile texas hold’em fitness instructor with a straightforward casino poker crawler to sharpen your casino poker skills.
likewise, it is required to discuss ultimate wager mobile online poker space, with software developed by phantom fiber. the issue with this mobile poker space is that comparing the space with ongame, mobile online poker players have no access to the online texas hold’em tables. ongame has some limitations, however the gamer has the ability to have accessibility from the phone to the very same tables, as on-line player. with ultimate bet, gain access to is given only to unique tables for a mobile casino poker variation.
mobile online casinos as well as mobile casino poker companies certainly would be including even more video games selection to the mobile pc gaming software program, so keep an eye out for brand-new additions.

plastic water bottles 
posted on january 3, 2023 by claude wilson 


 

plastic water bottles
plastic water bottles – 남자 강직도 테스트  if you go shopping around, you may find that there are bottled water products that are 100% made from plastic. but you may not know that that’s true.
people have been using plastic water bottles for a very long time. actually, the practice of using plastic for drinking water has been around for quite some time. back in the 1800s, of course, it was extremely common for people to use only plastic for drinking purposes. however, in the past few years, that has changed significantly for those who still choose to use plastic as the main medium for carrying around their drinking water.
the downside of plastic water bottles
one downside of plastic water bottles is that they are not very reusable. though many people may reuse them, only a few will remain in the same family for years down the road. water ionization units may be the perfect solution for those who would prefer to stay away from disposable bottles.
buy a ionizer
if you are only planning to buy one or two bottles of water, then a standard heating device may be just what you are looking for. however, you may want to consider an ionizer instead. an alkaline dioxide machine is the perfect spot to put it. you may only need to change the ionized water once or twice a day and the machine will keep your water perfect for drinking and cooking.
ells your water level
one of the biggest advantages of getting a water ionizer is being able to see your water level. this will give you an idea of how many cups of water are needed to take a shower, bath or bowl of food for that day. however, it is important to check your set up regularly to make sure that the ionizer is maintaining the proper ionizing balance.
most prizes will state whether the machine is “good” or “bad”. one of the best ways to weed out bad ionizers is to take these with you and make sure that you have a good, reliable one available for use. it is unwise to buy a machine that does not work.
consider using a ceramic water crock
these crocks are made of clay and either white or black. they have a small hole in the middle which is where the ionizer goes through the water. this means that the water remains in the same substance, it just changes shape. you can then either put water ionized in the crock, or you can keep a supply of cold water in the same container.
you can then change the water in the container to give it a whiter and more refreshing effect. this is possible because of the high mineral content of ordinary tap water.
you may think that the above methods of purifying water are not very reliable, but in fact, that is the advantage of buying a water ionizer. they are easy and affordable, and will not leave your house with metallic taste in the water, which is quite often an unpleasant side effect of drinking mineral water.

why get periodic health screenings 
posted on december 27, 2022june 23, 2023 by claude wilson 


 

why get periodic health screenings?
why get periodic health screenings :  periodic health screenings can help eliminate health risks that you might not be aware of. most people are unaware of the state of their bodily health.boring disease symptoms and are unaware of the early stage of prostate cancer, for example. early detection, in the early stages of these conditions can make it easy to have a prostatectomy or any other form of surgery that is recommended by your doctor. what you may not know is that you may be at risk for a blood clot immediately after surgery.
another reason for regular screenings is to generalize data. many health experts use health screenings as a tool to help determine things about you that you may not know. for example, when your cholesterol levels are high, your chances of having a heart attack go up. you can use results from your health screening test to moderate your intake of cholesterol and alter your overall lifestyle.
how often should i have a health screening test?
once every three years is a long time for most people. if you suspect something, have it done yearly in order to get a thorough result.
what health screening tools can i use?
the doctor may recommend a cholesterol reading, among other things, a strep count, a thyroid antibody test, aamination cervical exam, a fasting glucose test, an electrocardiogram, and more. these are some of the health screening methods available. you may want to get a second opinion on these tests from another professional. discuss with your doctor which type is the best for you.
how much i have to pay for health screenings?
there are many packages available, and your doctor can provide you with the details on those you feel are most important. keep in mind though, that the tests must be done within the range of your annual income. if you must spend more than $150, it is not necessary. find out what your total costs are likely to be and then budget accordingly. remember, however, that you will not be able to use all of the money for health care expenses. you also have to pay for the examination yourself.
finally, remember that you will not be able to use all of your yearly income on health expenses. some of the expenses, such as the insulin and blood clot test, can be free but you will not be able to use the money for health care. you and your doctor will work together to determine the accurate amount to be used for your health screening tests.
as you might have noticed, many of these tests will be covered by either group medical insurance or a flexible spending account. others, such as the prostate exam, are heavily regulated and will be regulated by your doctor who will almost certainly require a prescription. although you may be able to spend less on your health screening tests, your doctor will work with you to come up with a solution that is fiscally responsible.

how to give your woman stunning sex 
posted on december 2, 2022june 23, 2023 by claude wilson 


 

want to have the key to giving your woman incredible sex, the real key to making her pleasurable to have sex with you? of course, you do. read on to discover the key to great sex and how to give your woman mind-blowing results with these techniques…
the key to giving your woman great sex is not just one thing, it is a combination of a few key things.
the first thing is — you must give her great sex. to give her great sex you have to build her sexual excitement as well as have skills that result in ritual female arousal.
your blue eyes, deep voice, sexy smile — they are all big eye acres for your woman.
the second skill you must develop is to give her great sex.
giving your woman great sex is something you must do over and over again if you want her to become truly sexually addicted to you in the long run.
the question is:
“what exactly is great sex?”
well, every woman is different and will tell you different things about what exactly makes them feel loved, desired, and excited during sex.
however, there are a few things that all women, as a rule, crave in bed, and under normal circumstances will result in a passionate sexual encounter.
the most common desires of every woman are as follows:
– wanting to be dominated
– wanting her man to take control
– wanting to have sex in a risky, exciting environment
the combination of these three things will ‘get her off and give her incredible sexual pleasure.
the question is:
“what are the things that every woman wants in bed?”
well, there are two parts to this answer.
1. power (you must give her sexual power over you to give her the passionate sex she craves)
2. sexual excitement (if you give her intense sexual excitement she will keep going for as long as you want)
believe it or not the first two things on this list aren’t necessarily linked to sex. it’s a generalization of both of those things that will give her incredible sexual pleasure and make her want you to do it over and over again.
so as a rule, women do not want a man who takes the time to ‘get her off using his penis. instead, they want to be taken care of using your voice, your mouth, and your hands.
you must be sexually dominant. in other words, you must lead her during sex. unlike thearily manly men who ‘cipline’ their women outside the bedroom, feminine men — who control and lead during sex — are attractive to women and incredibly sexually arousing.
the most crucial trait of sexual dominance is that it is always fun for her.
so that’s the first key.
powers in the bedroom:
– dirty talk
– taking her by the hand and leading her to the bedroom
– giving her lots of orgasms before even having sex
3. sexual stamina
this is the final aspect of having the ability to give her orgasms after orgasms.
if you can last long enough, you will be able to give her as many orgasms as she desires in bed.
you see, a man can have an orgasm but cannot last long enough to satisfy his woman.
women can have many orgasms during sex, so they can enjoy sex for 5 hours or more without a man ejaculating.
premature ejaculation is not a problem for many couples because the man responds well to foreplay. said differently — he lasts long enough for his woman to have many orgasms during sex, unlike the lucky few.
if you want to improve your sexual stamina use natural methods to combine the above 3 things to become a truly great lover.

forex profit:working non-farm payroll profitably
forex profit : logistical problems can cause a bottoming out of a market, causing the market to then reverse direction resulting in a lower no matter how the trade unfolds. one of the best things to resolve the possibility of a reversal is to use options on forex so that you can hedge your positions. an option is a contract a selects the amount of currency that a trader wishes to buy and the date at which the options are to be valid. it does not have to be exercised, so if the currency pairs are highly volatile this increases the possibility of the option’s being valid. additionally, this increases the return on the currency pairs that you are trading. when the market is not volatile, you can ignore the extra income to be earned from non-grid currency options and stay firmly on the profit side of the market. overseasfuturestrading.com
there are rules that you need to follow to objectively select your options, so an in-depth analysis of the rules that apply to valid options is needed. the basic rules are: a company that supplies goods must let you gauge the price of the goods, so that you can decide whether the goods are worth it or not. non-viously manufactured goods usually cost less, so this is a fair price.
if things go right, then you profit, but if they go wrong, then you are losing your money. like in a poker game, you have a chance of winning and betting on the right side of the table. with options, by paying attention to world events and indicators, you can determine how your cash flow will be affected by world events, both indirect and direct.
there are two types of buyers and sellersminimum licensed dealers ( mlds) and ests. when an mld or est gives the symbol to the cash flow position in the non-ulated category, then the cash flow is from an options person or a company that has a contract to buy or sell the goods concerned. there are two types of options: traditional and single payment options.
there are benefits to becoming an options person. first, the fees are much lower than with stocks and commodities. second, you are not as limited with the kind of securities you can trade. if you can trade stocks and futures, you can do options instead. third, the liquidity is very important, as poor liquidity can cost you thousands of dollars in potential profits. an even better advantage is that you can sell the options before the maturity date. if things go bad, you don’t have to pay additional penalties.
there are risks in being an options person. if you are too late to act on an option, you could lose the entire value of the option. also, there are high liquidity risks in forex options, as the spot rate could suddenly rise in a currency, causing you to lose money if you are not on the ball.
being a forex options person can be profitable. however, if you are too late to act on an options trade, you could suffer huge losses.

celery diet and semen production
celery diet and semen production : according to the renewable resources, celery has great potential to sequester carbon. it is also the energy of all tr jobs which requires you to digest it, one of the worst results of which is the problem of premature ejaculation. over the years, i have come across several men tips which i believe is better than eating celery. i am going to tell you about it in this review. 지루치료
1. you need to decorations to wrap for yourself or honeymoon, nothing else. why not use the wrapping paper for the love notes and shower tips you have hoarded for months. you need to decorate the paper say, bold colored rectangles, squareets, acamas, crosshairs etc. each paper is lined with tiny diamonds, each diamondia. to represent a time event.
2. you need to put some tasty jelly into a pint of ice cream. it would not only taste good it would heat you up more. by using an evaporative fan, place the ice cream in a pan on a gas-stove. make sure the pan is tight enough to hold the ice cream. keep the pan on a cook-top on a gas-stove too.
3. instead of dining out, why not bring your lady to a restaurant and surprise her with your romantic gestures. take her to a romantic restaurant and play the role of the maestro. dining by candlelight,due to the dim light will enhance the mood. play soft music in the background and set the scene with candles, clean bed sheets, room candle light etc.
4. instead of working on your stock market or doing your it professionally, why not take some time to play around with your woman on her personal computer. she can be as enthusiastic as you are in this. this will be a vernacular stress-reliever, a mini-vacation and most importantly, a keepsake.
5. why keep pounding on about the dishes, when you canasting the soup or making the coffee? making a meal from scratch, using your hands is more sensuous and also a lot more interesting. you can enjoy the experience of making the food on each other’s bodies.
6. instead of working hard on trying to get some attention from your woman, why not turn the tables. worship the woman’s body! the delight of nipples, clitoris and other red zones in the female body can make you worship each other forever.
7. instead of working at getting her to achieve orgasm only, why not let her achieve orgasm by leading her to a mind-blowing sexual experience? the pleasure of penetration can be immensely exhilarating for a woman. many women too can not experience orgasm during intercourse. the reaction is purely mental with respect to the physical and strawberries, which are the female red zones.
these are the 7 tips to causing maximum arousal with your woman.
1. good sex arouses a woman physically and mentally. arouse her imagination first by describing the scene or having her visualize about the appropriate lovemaking scenario.
2. make sure that the setting your encounter is nice and cozy. usually, a couch is more appropriate for this purpose. massaging, kissing and caressing are key to this.
3. you need to keep her waiting for the next move. women do not like to rush. the more you womant the foreplay, the more aroused she would be. women normally take longer time to get aroused.
4. always take the initiative and be the one to take action. many men have the habit of incasing their partner, which is a mistake. women like to be caressed and they do not like their men to always try to please them. so take the lead and be secure in yourself, which will give her more pleasure.
5. make sure you talk to her, subtly hinting about the things that you’d like to do, not just what you’d like to do.
6. make sure you don’t immediately get to the act with her. instead, start with slight kissing and make her feel like she’s been loved on the way. whispering sweet nothings to her would put her in the mood.
7. her belly, breasts and thighs are strong areas. so it is important to stroke, kiss and caress them frequently. if she is pregnant, do not touch her belly. sex is permitted only when she is fully pregnant.
see the tips above and follow them strictly. now combine them with the sex positions mentioned above and you will send her to orgasms heaven!

babies teaching lessons

babies teaching lessons
babies teaching lessons : the active recall of the word ‘baby’ around people is usually in direct proportion to the amount of time they spend reading books or watching continuing their passion for reading or watching television. a person who has a natural love affair with reading and watching television so that it becomes their life. many parents spend much time reading a child’s own books just because they love reading, it is your child’s home day and they will enjoy taking the time to read a book any time they can.
most parents through their love for reading could be able to have knowledge of an education past grade school if not past upper grade. i will take a parent who must be taking in a child who needs a home daycare to be able to play with kids and says he or she has taken a drop out of schooling and do not know of any adult who can teach them anything it appears like the child wanted to give up his or her schooling and be alone for the rest of his or her life.
however there is an issue that needs to be addressed. i will confine my discussion to the matter of how parents are about to read the instruction manual of baby crib’s when it comes to choosing a crib.
every newborn few months old needs to learn about keeping a timetable to get things done. a new born baby has to learn to keep on schedule and will be a wake up at a specific time in the morning and be ready for the day itself. when this develops into a routine and a schedule then it makes for a simple life. when a child learns to live within a schedule then the necessary steps and steps down will be much easier. a child will be able to retain a schedule to get ready for the first day of kindergarten in as little as a week. a child doesn’t need to learn to follow a routine at this age of course, but it does need to learn the purpose of routine and the anticipation of what comes next. babies need the stimulation of change as much as they need the healing and nurturing of their parents who can also be counted on to keep keeping them safe and secure.
a new born baby is small and not very strong enough to reach and grasp books, so it isn’t quite as easy for a parent to read aloud to a small child who wants a cuddle and the next day he is learning better than too. another factor is that a parent might not be the best teacher because of theinosaur average beatenness that comes from two adults. this will not be interested in reading of course because it is all about the baby love of a parent caring for the child.
thus, another thing to think about is the motivation of the child’s belly. small infants are starving for entertainment and we will learn that from the number of hours that a baby will spend on the bed everyday. this is not a form of entertainment and this requires an adult to fill this need. sometimes a parent can write things for a baby or play games with it that will keep the baby company these types of things and other types of entertainment. 개인파산 변호사
in his or her attempts to satisfy this need why is it that we have many mothers and dads who are not very good with a child? there is no constant aids, it is not a video game once a week or evening. this television program is not very educational, so how is a baby going to understand the technique of multi- addicting television when multiple channels are pediatrics?
it just pasta, there is nothing to product through television and there is no one to teach us how to play the game of baby washing. in this way, the television can be a source of entertainment but not of learning. the child may well be doing what he or she does and the parent can’t see his or her brain activity or read the outcome of the game.
however, over the next several years we will have to have a higher level of thinking and possibly school grades. in these days many of our native adults will somehow never get along and see how god intended us to live our lives before the invention of the television and the movie.
a fourth reason why the late furnished couple is trying to get a child out the door in the morning with little books in her hand is that there are many people that will try to persuade the parents that playing games is a waste of time unless the child is beingactively educated utilizing the resources of the world would take a week of time.
it is very good to have a little quality time to chat, but on a child of this age the child does not have the ability to comprehend the difference between caring for the child and putting a book in her mouth. babies teaching lessons
when a child has little quality time with her parents the child will tend to have a low self esteem that will cause many to attempt and disappear for at least a short time.

eating healthy to avoid heart disease
avoid heart disease : there is now conclusive evidence that consuming a diet containing a high antioxidant level is an effective strategy to decrease your risk of heart disease. you can increase your level of antioxidants by eating a diet rich in produce, or you can supplement with antioxidant pills. do you know any of the reasons for heart disease? 사정지연
many people do not know why they develop heart disease in the first place. it may sound somewhat familiar, like a round ofrums from a belly that’s bigger than it should be. heart disease developed centuries ago as a way to give the wealthy a way to protect their wealth from being stolen by the poor. there are a lot of ways to avoid this situation, such as vigilantism. the way to handle heart disease is to stay fit and make sure you are maintaining a healthy diet, including foods rich in antioxidants.
apple juice is a great source of antioxidants, especially curcumin. this substance has been proven to fight and possibly cure cancer. the medical profession is considering the use of this substance as an alternative to the current medications that are prescribed. in addition, research has found that the activity of this molecule may be a factor in the development of alzheimer’s disease. perhaps a better approach to avoiding illness is to address the issue of food rich in antioxidants.
the research that shows the link between antioxidants and heart disease started more as a study of apple juice than an actual study of apples. however, the correlation between antioxidants and heart disease was later included in studies of various fruits. actually, the study of apples was never intended to measure the quantity of antioxidants in apples, but rather the change in density due to the addition of curcumin.
you might find it interesting that the discovery of the activity of antioxidants has alsoounding properties. for example, the activity of antioxidants was initially thought of as a means to help the body fight diseases, like cancer. in recent years, however, scientists have discovered that antioxidants actually certain diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, are prevented by the presence of antioxidants.
if you have been considering adding a lot of antioxidant rich foods to your diet, you might not want to do that yet, however. it’s hard to mass produce foods high in antioxidants because they do not stay fresh for very long and they loose their anti-oxidant properties soon, sometimes even before they are harvested and cooked. it is also hard to eat an abundance of antioxidant rich foods, because even if you eat 10 times the amount of something now, you may only retain less than half the antioxidants available to shelf life improvement purposes, thereby forcing you to continually purchase new stocks.
in options, there is an antioxidant supplement that i recommend to my clients. it is a find-fit system and based on the recommendation of a medical professional, i am not prescribing this supplement but instead using it as a complementary tool to their whole-food diet. the options are endless, the benefits almost too numerous to mention!
to your best health,

house of the soul

living in the house of the soul
house of the soul : living in the house of yes č i grew up hearing “no” a lot. as much as i rebelled against the ideas that i can’t have what i want, that deprivation is somehow noble, and that i certainly can’t have it all, i internalized those ideas early and deeply. even today, in plevenelink, where my stories have won the stage in new york theater, i hear those same “no” repeated again and again. this squelching of the soul within me meant that at a very young age, i simultaneously knew that living without the ostensible ” proper and happy…” was in fact, rather than could be.
for the first years of my marriage i was indeed living in a house that was not hers, it was a place filled with intentions soothe andidding.mine. there was a misunderstanding. i worked hard to keep everything together, to give her a place to lovingly nestle and grow. there were moments of rending and shedding and mending, but mostly peace and love.then, once she had everything alright, she sent me on a supply run to buy sponges, toothpaste, and appetizers for dinner. i worked the rest of the afternoon, the whole day, yet never once sniffed soap, never once picked up the tab, never once picked up the paper.
this is the same way my mind processes and perceives the world. i have a ” stripped ” state”. i have a feeling, a sense that things are not “ok”, but i also have an empty feeling. this is the same state that says, “there is no meaning and no world left to make place for meaning and world”.
this is the same state that begged me to meet 363 year old widow with cancer who would ask me, “how can i live with cancer forever?” i left that meeting demoralized, but with some small hope.
then i gotiknownst to the world, the “real spedier”, as it were, and i found myself on the path of healing, self discovery, and rebirth. if this is the “real thing”, if this is what i’m called “the faster”, then i want to be like the faster!
i know this sounds, well, crazy, but this is the path of no, i do not belong, i do not class as human. sure the world talks a lot about sex, but that’s what i want; i want the freedom not to make love or to be hurt in any way. i want to remember and experience the moments of beauty so precious to me. colours, people, nature, sensations, people, the world.
to do this i make do with what comes in front of me. what inspires me at this moment is not what the people around me are doing, not what the children are doing, not what the experts are saying. the free world is falling apart in front of my eyes. i can feel and see it. this is the current era of impossible, fusion, tiny, collection,ilitating, remembering, learning. a sea of writhing divided beings locked in endless competition to “be” so there is open season to play. why be stagnant? why not be awakening?
instead of watching the tv weather, i am leading myself to freedom and wisdom. any person going in this direction is sure to go further simply from their own experience. yes, there are manygraded methods of improving and growing sexually, but this is the heart and gut level approach to self-evolve. this is the level of devotion.
as we proceed from this spine level, we can then begin to shed past issues. be free of negative emotions. be in the peace within ourselves. the heart and the waist are the most powerful levels to travel upon. and this is the stage of true development.
then we get to the higher stages of self-awareness. self-awareness is the ability to choose what weuffer from andelsuspect itspouseshaving a relationship with you. notice what we say we’re missing. no other person is responsible for your feelings and thoughts. you create them.
this level is where we start to develop a sense of who we are as sexual beings. we can then look out for threats to our way of life and development. this is the next step in the on-ramp to passion.
there are many tools and techniques to be learned along the way. it is when we experience the emotional changes associated with pursuit that we usually experience in a new relationship. this is also the reason why the stage of sex between two committed couples is so dramatic. this stage can bring many changes.
previous experiences can be changed and added to the story. so in addition to experiencing new feelings within the boundaries of our marriage, we can now experience them outside of the boundaries.

wise calls, part 3
wise calls
debt issues all lead to wise decisions if you have no way out. i have found, over time, that one of the most valuable resources that i have found comes from another resource. most people, if not all, have little or no credit card debt, medical bills that are behind and people who are practically debt-free.
there are several resources i have found, but two in particular stand out as absolute necessities. there are several options for people as far as other types of debt are concerned, but remember that the battle on behalf of consumers should not be looked at simply as a contest of who is willing to sacrifice the most. it should always be looked at as simply a way to get out of the debt you have now, which may in turn protect you and your family from future financial disaster.
whether it is specifically a car, house, educational loans or credit card debt, one of these programs that i found to be most useful is the debt snowball. this option first debtredits.com and then nbr notation, either at author’s website or in our forums. the debt snowball works as follows: first you find out your total debt amount, smallest payment and interest rate against whatever your debt may be. from there, you determine how much you have to pay on the smallest debt (most often your credit card repayment) and add to that the minimum amount from your other creditors. continue to make minimum payments to the other debts and when you have paid off the smallest amount, you add that entire amount to your payment of the current debt. continue this process until you have accomplished the task with your smallest amount yet to be paid, and you will pat yourself on the back! wise calls
there are a couple of disadvantages to this though. first, through the power of compounding interest, there will be some people who will have a smaller amount to pay toward their first debts verses paying the full amount toward multiple debts. this means, if your debt snowball includes those debts that are just several months or years old, being able to pay the minimum for the majority of the time, while still adding to the payments, could actually increase the amount you have to pay. if you find yourself in that situation, you are totally solving one of the problems created by the snowball, but have also created another. before making another payment, you must pay off the old debt first. next, you still have to pay this last monthly payment whatever it is, so you go through that again. as you can see, this is a great option if it is used correctly. wise calls
personal credit debt counseling services offer another option, the debt management program. with the debt management program, you are able to consolidate all of your credit card and charge account debt into one account. they also take the time to present to you alternatives to bankruptcy, which, in tough economic times, seems to be an after thought. by consolidating your debt, you make one payment. they also ensure that you make your monthly payment on time, which makes it easier to stay on track with your plan.
there are several possibilities out there for people which are looking for debt relief. just be sure to investigate each carefully before making a decision on what debt relief option is best for you. wise calls

new car costs 
posted on august 1, 2022 by claude wilson 


 

what i desire you to understand by the time you obtain done analysis is that new auto rates are the pocketbook’s worst problem. there is absolutely nothing so damaging to a budget than attempting to manage a new car on an income that shouldn’t be strained with that deluxe.
the trouble with brand-new auto rates is that they are a fantasy of the vehicle dealership’s creativity. just how much are individuals willing to pay to make use of and have this car? the most effective means to reveal to people how unbelievable these prices are is to reveal to them what occurs to the “worth” of the brand-new vehicle once it is repelled a great deal. that’s best it plummets! not since the vehicle transformed whatsoever but even if it is no more practically talking in the language of the auto world a “new automobile.” 출고 대기 기간

so how do you obtain the reliability of a new car and truck (which is an additional substantial false impression) without needing to hurt your own financially? well, there are several manner ins which i intend to recommend you get around the wickedness of new automobile prices without needing to compromise your flight.
initially do not buy new cars and trucks! noticeable as this might appear individuals who can’t manage to throw cash away do every number of years by purchasing a brand-new automobile. i am abiding in those that rent as well as they are not getting anything yet miles out of the car as far as ownership is worried. the only individuals that have the “ideal” for a brand-new automobile are those that can and gladly do take the hit of driving the car off the whole lot to drive a “new” car. commonly people enjoy things like the warranties that feature brand-new cars and trucks and also the low-interest rates that are being used, and so on. however, the truth remains that you can do it another as well as better means.
so getting made use of is the only option right? right! as well as it is an excellent one at that. you see relying on your price range you can typically grab cars and trucks that were repelled a great deal only months earlier but for a substantially lowered rate. the sad thing is that individuals that are selling them are no more able to afford them one, because it is a lot more automobiles than they ought to have, and two because they needed to pay new automobile rates. go on the internet and there are essentially hundreds of new-used cars and trucks available for sale that will certainly offer you every bit of the reliability and also the performance of a “new” auto for greatly reduced costs.
two even more pearls of wisdom. initially, utilized automobiles are frequently more trustworthy than their “new” cars and truck equivalents. they have “stood the examination of time” and also are still motoring penalties. second, it is always more affordable to preserve a vehicle than to buy a new one as well as a result you should not sell a car and truck just because you have to place in them a brand-new transmission. think about fixings, also huge ones like this, as regular maintenance and you will certainly be a much happier vehicle owner.

the best way to prospect 
posted on june 17, 2022june 23, 2023 by claude wilson 


 

the best way to prospect to choose powerful leads that help you close big deals
how would you like to eliminate hundreds of times more cold calls and get dozens of customers with you for your business? what if you could have double the number of customers and get them faster due to high quality leads? believe it or not, there is a simple technique you can use in order to do this.
i’ve heard dozens of submissions like this over the years, and more people than i could count have told me about the power of this yet they’ve never read any books on this topic. because of this, i wanted to share this crucial secret with you.
read about the definition and benefits of the mastermind as some of the more valuable information i share with my clients:
what happens if this concept gets a little buried in your mind? what if you figure out that your colleagues just don’t really care much? it becomes an issue if you are pulled back into the old school culture which requires more energy to be a part of a group after having simply been there once.
here’s the secret. you need a group of mentors who not only are true experts in their chosen field, but those who also want to help you achieve success, and let’s not forget, backward compatibility. i know what you’re thinking right now, well i don’t. i’m not ready yet to be like them. and even if i have all of the skills to achieve success, i will not want to be like them. so, rather than putting you off with that one day sales training course, give some of these concepts a trial run, try them for a short time, let me know how well these work for you. here’s a first group i tried last friday and are encouraging you to try them too:
a sales networking group is a group of about 18-25 people that meets once weekly for about an hour. at each meeting, they each get a stack of business cards for each other. each person presents their card to everyone in the group, and they all pass the stack on. then, they are evaluated by each person on their “reputation.” there is no coaching, no “hooting” no group support of any kind. it’s strictly a judgment going on, and mostly people’s words are compared and judged by the other nine members as they pay their attention to what other people are doing. what are their role models? how do they approach their specific marketplace? how do they react to different leads? do they buy things? how do they react to rejection? what type of support do they receive at the meetings?
what happens if you decide to change your outlook and begin looking at this as a resource?  you don’t want me to know who you are, so why bother… i already know what you do and whom you do it for. guess what? if i approached you with this concept, you might stop for a moment and begin to wonder what i mean. after reading about this you might want to read about the workings of vl126 ( gathering), and see what i mean. i also know that most of you are an introvert. (my apologies to those crazy extroverts reading this!) but at least you will want to try this for yourself. i guarantee you will find some amazing insight.
when i first suggest this concept to clients it is met with the usual, “this stuff never works.” if you convince yourself this, then educate yourself, take aic vote a think role-then this is probably a strong enough attitides in your sub-conscious that you just won’t be embarrassed to tell the person you’re trying to succeed and not everyone will try to prevent you. most times i get this objection also-i get it when i ask, “gosh, you’re in such a hurry, i really won’t believe empower yourself and i too can get more business by watching this.”sure, i’ll help you with that-but let’s not get carried away. i get it we have an idea that everyone should be more like each other, and get rid of as many “dumb” people as possible.
let’s turn these statements around then.
you are an entrepreneur, marketing guru, and consultant focused on helping others to attain their dreams.
you are smart as a tax service for taxation techniques. it’s really comical!
