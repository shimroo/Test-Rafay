                            welcome to saint nicholas!
                        



                            we are in mckinney texas, about 20 miles north of dallas.
                            we are diverse community of orthodox christians from all parts of the globe. some of us are
                            emigres from russia,
                            ukraine, greece, bulgaria and other orthodox nations, while others are american converts to
                            orthodoxy. we have all found
                            the "pearl of great price" in the holy catholic and apostolic eastern orthodox christian
                            church,
                            and we hope that this
                            web page will give you (in english and some russian) a taste of our beliefs, dogmas,
                            doctrines
                            and way of life.
                        

                            the divine liturgy and other services are performed in english, with
                            some things added in church
                            slavonic. we gladly welcome visitors and inquirers and always have a complimentary meal on
                            sunday to get
                            acquainted.
