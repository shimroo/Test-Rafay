10 simple tips to gain weight and put on muscle






skinny people will find that 
transforming their body is tough and results are hard to come by. 
however, with the right diet, exercise and attitude – nothing is 
impossible. here are 10 simple tips that’ll help you gain weight and put
 on muscle.
 

1.  try eating 5 to 6 meals a day

in order to gain weight, you need to
 start eating a lot of meals. however, it is important that you break 
these meals into parts as eating a lot at once may result in indigestion
 and your body may not be able to absorb all the calories. you may not 
find yourself too hungry 3 hours after eating lunch, but eat anyway and 
notice how your appetite increases from day to day.

2.  do weight training at least 3 times a week

when you train with weights, your 
muscles will grow.  also, it is important that you gradually keep 
increasing the weight with which you train. as you train, your strength 
will increase and you shouldn’t find it exceptionally difficult to do 
so.  for eg., if you are doing lateral pull downs with 60 pounds of 
weight, try and increase it to 70 pounds the next time.

3.  eat 300-500 calories more than your body burns

eating 300-500 calories more than 
your normal intake may not be easy, but you must do it if you want to 
stop being skinny. make sure you don’t do it just by over-eating at 
once, but instead do it gradually over the whole day. consult a 
dietician to figure out how much you should eat each day. 

4.  don’t just aim for visual gains, work out your back and leg muscles too

there are some muscles you can 
clearly see and admire in the mirror and some muscles you cannot. a lot 
of gym goers usually train only the muscles on their arms, chest and 
shoulders and this is a grave error. firstly, it will give you a 
disproportionate body that not many people like. also, it will make you 
prone to injuries. therefore, make sure you workout your entire body.

5.  load up on protein

you know that you have to consume 
300-500 more calories than your normal intake every day, but don’t try 
and do this by eating junk food. try to eat foods rich in protein like 
cheese, meat, eggs, etc. 

6.  drink your calories

it may be tough to meet your calorie
 requirements by just eating. drinking milk, milkshakes or protein 
shakes with little or no sugar can be a great way to load up on 
calories.

7.  try and eat fast (but don’t choke on it)

people who are trying to lose weight
 are advised exactly the opposite but for the same reason. your body 
takes some time to give signals of satiety which is why eating fast can 
help you eat more.

8.  focus on recovery after each workout

stretching exercises, showers, foods
 rich in carbohydrates can help recover your body significantly. also, 
you should aim for 8 hours of sleep as inadequate sleep can cause 
several problems.

9.  don’t expect immediate gains

hoping to gain weight quickly in a 
healthy manner is unrealistic. even if you follow all the advice that is
 there, you may end up gaining just 2-5 pounds in a month. every body is
 different, and just because you are not seeing results in terms of 
weight gain, you shouldn’t feel discouraged. living healthy will make 
you feel better and more positive about life and increase your strength,
 and if those things are happening then you’re doing it right. don’t 
worry, with the right attitude, you will gain weight.

10.  believe

following your regime may seem 
incredibly difficult if you don’t believe that you will one day be able 
to transform your body. if you are not seeing any gains even after 
working so hard, work harder. eat more, lift more and stay inspired.
