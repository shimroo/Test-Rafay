cruze clean turbo diesel's engine creates "perfect storm"
posted by dave on july 31, 2013 @ 06:33 pm pst


detroit - the all-new 2014 chevrolet cruze clean turbo diesel's advanced 2.0l engine uses a variable-swirl intake system to create a "perfect storm" of air and fuel that helps enhance performance while reducing emissions.

"variable swirl helps put the 'clean' in cruze clean turbo diesel. it increases the mixture-motion of air and fuel in low-speed, low-load driving, like when youre doing the commuter crawl to work every day," said mike siegrist, 2.0l turbo diesel assistant chief engineer.

2014 chevrolet cruze clean turbo diesel

chicago - the all-new 2014 chevrolet cruze clean turbo diesel features an advanced 2.0l clean diesel engine that will offer an estimated 42 mpg highway with an automatic transmission and expected best-in-segment range based on gm testing. clean diesels generate at least 90 percent less nitrogen oxide (nox) and particulate emissions when compared to previous-generation diesels. it is the cleanest diesel passenger car engine ever produced by general motors.

cruze's 2.0l turbo-diesel is based on proven architecture already used in european models, where approximately 40 percent of all cruze models sold feature a diesel engine. collaborating with italian and german engineering groups, gm's diesel experts in the united states adapted the engine to accommodate more stringent diesel emission standards and a wider range of driving conditions - including colder climates and higher altitudes - for the united states and canada.
