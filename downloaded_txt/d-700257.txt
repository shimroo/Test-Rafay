markham landscape products is a family-owned and operated landscape materials business. since our humble beginnings in 1996 we have grown from one mulch pile to the preferred materials supplier, with four locations, for many of the major contractors and discriminating homeowners in the carolinas. our top priority is, and always has been, that our customers are fully satisfied with the complete buying process.


our goal is that you would feel special and appreciated from the time you walk through the door, or call us on the phone, to the moment you pull your vehicle off our lot or our delivery truck drives away from your job site.  the quality and value of our products are of the utmost importance to us, and we are constantly working to introduce new products to the charlotte market. we invite you to take a look around some of our products on this page and then visit our yards.  we look forward to meeting you!
