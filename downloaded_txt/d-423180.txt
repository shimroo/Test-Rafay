2024 italian festival!
welcome to seattle’s 37th annual festa italiana! festa italiana is an all-volunteer community organization that produces an annual series of events the last week of september, culminating in a free italian festival. since 1988, we have been celebrating the cultural roots of italians and italian-americans in the pacific northwest by promoting the arts, the food and the culture that are uniquely italian.
this year, the italian festival will again be back at seattle center and we plan to be bigger than ever. so again, thanks to our sponsors, vendors, chefs and entertainers, and to our volunteers, and you, our beloved patrons and supporters!

coming back by popular demand


  





anthony “nino” lane band




our headliner this year will see the return of a rockin’ 6-piece from salinas, ca called the anthony “nino” lane band, covering all your italian favorites through the decades with an emphasis on danceability! their lineup features two native italian singers, two latino & latina vocalists, guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, saxophone and violin! they will be doing three shows for us over the weekend so watch for those, especially on saturday evening, the night of the “all-star italian jam.”

































  





the return of the rigatones!




for the past 20 years, the beer & wine garden at festa was rockin’ each day at 4 pm to the sounds of “the rigatones,” the dynamic duo of lenny luzzi and tom falcone leading raucous italian sing-a-longs. last year, things were more subdued because tom had retired from playing, and lenny had moved to nashville to further his music career. well, hold onto your wine bottles, because this year, we are thrilled to announce “the rigatones are back!!!” lenny has reformed the duo with clayton patterson, his former guitarist with the primo basso band, and they’ve been doing shows in nashville so they’re ready to return and tear the place apart! as always, no admission charge but you must be 21/over and show id.








































  





la cucina galbani® cooking stage





  





over the years we have had live cooking demos from chefs representing such local restaurants as: café juanita, tulio, il fornaio, il terrazzo carmine, café bengodi, serefina, assaggio, etc. some of their recipes can be found in our online recipe collection. at the same time, we have featured such national culinary luminaries as mario batali, giuliano bugali, anne burrell, biba caggiano, michael chiarello, rocco dispirito, mary ann esposito, christina pirello, rosella rago and nick stellino. during 2020 we solicited “virtual” cooking demos, from local chefs and celebrities alike, for you to enjoy at home as you cook along! just visit the great italian chef page to see demos from local chefs such as brad inserra and frank isernio to national stars like rossella rago.
this year we’ve lined up some great chefs for you to watch in person on the rooftop terrace of fisher pavilion. a chef will take the stage every hour throughout the weekend from 11:00am – 5:00pm.

quiz and presentation




for the past several years, domenico minotti has prepared a quiz for festa italiana, an annual celebration of italian culture, food and music held each year at the seattle center at the end of september. since this year’s festa italiana will be virtual, domenico has prepared a virtual quiz to go along with that. the quiz was premiered september 9th 2020 at the dante alighieri society’s english language meeting held virtually on zoom. links to pdfs of the quiz and the answer key along with the presentation are available below.

about domenico (“nick”) minotti
in the late 1920s, nick’s parents emigrated from sant’angelo, limosano, a small hilltop town in molise. the population at that time was about 1000 but is now 345 as nick learned on a visit last year. the family spoke their dialect at home. nick studied italian at columbia university and perugia and got lots of practice while on fulbright study grants in milan in the mid 60’s. nick returned to the states and to his first love, medicine, at georgetown university and came to seattle in 1976 to work at the us public health hospital on beacon hill, better known as the marine hospital. he and his father pasquale would attend dante meetings back then but took a break until retirement a few years ago. nick serves as a consigliere for our dante group.

roberto mario tacchi, memorial collection
a special memorial collection of works has been added to “le arti della festa italiana” art exhibit at the italian festival this year in honor of  roberto mario tacchi whose elegant woodcarvings adorn seattle public spaces and personal collections and who passed away may 15, 2019 at the age of 80. born in florence italy, roberto learned his craft from his father, becoming the seventh generation of woodcarvers in the tacchi family.
as opposed to his large public works, this collection will be of “chamber pieces” that he carved primarily for family, friends and private collectors. they will be on display in the armory on saturday and sunday, september  28 & 29, 2019 from 10 am – 5 pm each day. admission is free. patrons of the “taste of italy” wine tasting on friday night, september 27th will also be able to view the collection.
his public works present in the seattle area include the exterior doors of the first presbyterian church in downtown seattle, the chapel at providence marianwood in issaquah and a memorial display in the bell harbor conference center. surely even more treasured are the frames, sea shells and other carvings found in the homes of the many people who sought out his work for its elegance and sensuous beauty. when the henry art gallery at the university of washington obtained the loan of leonardo da vinci’s salvator mundi painting in 1982, they commissioned roberto to carve a late gothic altar and triptych in order to properly display this revered work.
