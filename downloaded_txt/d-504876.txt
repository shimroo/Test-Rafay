precision cartridge, inc. has been in business since 1986.  all cases are inspected, primer pockets reamed, then processed with scharch roller sizers to restore original case dimensions!  all reloading is done in our professional shop using camdex machines  (the same type the original manufacturers use!) and dillion rl-1000 machines.  the process is supervised by owner dennis g. fossey, former hobart, indiana police officer, with over 40 years of reloading experience.
