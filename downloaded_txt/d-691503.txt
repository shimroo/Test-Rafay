“on sept 23, 2024, norad aircraft flew a safe and disciplined intercept of russian military aircraft in the alaska adiz.  the conduct of one russian su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all – not what you’d see in a professional air force.” – gen. gregory guillot https://t.co/gxzj3ndkag
