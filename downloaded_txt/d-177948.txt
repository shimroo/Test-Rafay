"windchase is located in a beautiful little
                      valley beside the blue ridge, known locally as 'between
                      the hills.'  there
                      is something special about this particular spot on the
                      earth, something peaceful, almost magical. 
                      horses are happy at windchase, and people are too. 
                      there is not a day that goes by that i don't ride
                      around the farm and think how lucky i am to be here. 
                      i invite you to come out and join us, and
                      experience a bit of the windchase magic."
