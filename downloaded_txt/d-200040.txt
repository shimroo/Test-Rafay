it's a reputation built on passion



this way





for over 40 years cobra seats has been manufacturing exclusively in the united kingdom, earning a reputation that unites innovative technology, quality of design and functional elegance.
it’s a reputation built on passion. in the 1960’s len dunsford was acknowledged as one of the country’s best vehicle trimmers – his work graced racing cockpits used by names like moss, mcqueen and clark.
nowadays modern heroes place their trust in cobra’s ability to combine the very highest safety standards with weight saving technology… and cobra is still a family run company – grandson mark, who is managing director, shares his father’s and grandfather’s “hands on” passion for the art of building the finest seats and car interiors.

drivers using cobra seats have won ten of the last fourteen btcc driver's championships.
congratulations to jake hill who claimed the btcc driver's championship in the very last race of the 2024 season at brands hatch.

again, all three wins for drivers using cobra seats and with just three races to go “cobra boys” jake hill and tom ingram share the top step of the drivers’ standings.
the final dramas of the season began to unfold on the short national circuit at a very cold and wet silverstone.
by race three the heavens had opened and it was marginal as to whether the race would or should go ahead. in true btcc style, tom ingram was leading the race when,at the very last corner of the last lap, ash sutton – still with his eyes on the crown – challenged for the lead, tapped ingram who went sideways before saving the slide and crossing the line first, just ahead of the ford with josh cook taking his second third of the day.
amazingly jake hill’s fifth position means that as we approach the season finale at brands hatch, hill and ingram are equal on points with jake hill topping the table by virtue of his 7 race wins to ingram’s 5.

“cobra boys” jake hill and tom ingram continue to battle for the btcc crown.
the btcc roadshow returned to donington where the 2024 season began.
this time the inclusion of the melbourne loop meant that the drivers were navigating the gp circuit, but tom ingram was hoping for a repeat of the double win that heralded the start of his campaign.
cometh the hour, cometh the man and in race three tom ingram delivered the drive of the day and what may yet prove to be the drive of the season, starting 19th on the grid and working his way through the field to an incredible second, with cook fourth (his third fourth of the day!) and hill fifth.
the consistency of 7th, 3rd and that 5th place in the final race sees hill take a nine-point lead over ingram going into silverstone.

two 1-2’s for drivers using cobra seats.
a visit to the north yorkshire circuit heralds the arrival of the second half of the season with everything still to play for.
colin turkington “the king of croft” obviously didn’t want to relinquish his crown with a blistering qualifying session that put him on pole, followed by a comfortable lights to flag victory in race one – the 70th win of his career and his 15th at croft (the most dominant record of any btcc driver at any circuit).
