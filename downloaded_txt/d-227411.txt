the village is an american dream.an immigrant from a small town–nestled in the picturesque, rolling hills of tuscany–alfredo capitanini came to chicago in 1924 with little money, but big dreams. he knew nothing about restaurants but was eager to work, so he took a job as a dishwasher and began to build his ‘sogno americano’. just a few years later, the village was born.

copyright © 2024 all rights reserved*kindly note* for good and for bad, we have an incredibly old building. structurally there is nowhere we can add an elevator without demolishing a significant portion of our historic building and compromising its structural integrity. as such, the village is only accessible via stairs. please contact us with any questions.
