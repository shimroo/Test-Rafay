			welcome to tuffgrrlz - information for women in martial arts



 

 

welcome to the re-launch of the tuffgrrlz website.  i hope you enjoy the new look and (hopefully) new information.
tuffgrrlz is dedicated to female martial-artists and tough girls around the world. whether you are just starting out, have been in the martial-arts for years, or are considering taking up a martial-art. i am hoping that this site will be useful to you.
my hope is for this site to be an informative gathering place where women in the martial-arts can share ideas and stories about everything from their experience in the martial-arts to training and techniques.
