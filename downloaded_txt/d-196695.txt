    3 reasons why postcards don’t work (and what to do about it)


 by tim knifton from rsvp las vegas
•
january 23, 2025

postcards can be a great way to tell people about your business, but sometimes they don’t work the way you want them to. if you’ve sent postcards and didn’t get the results you hoped for, don’t worry! there are a few reasons why that might have happened. here are three reasons why your postcards might not be working and what you can do to fix them.                                                                                     1. your picture doesn’t show the message quickly                                                                  when people look at a postcard, they don’t spend a lot of time on it. if your picture doesn’t show them what your business can do right away, they might not even bother reading the words! the picture should tell them exactly what you’re offering in just a couple of seconds.                                                      what to do about it:                                               pick a picture that shows exactly what you’re offering. if you’re selling toys, use a photo of the toys. if you’re selling a service, show how it helps people. make sure the picture makes the message clear so people don’t have to think about it for too long.                                                                                                 2. there’s too much stuff on the postcard                                                                  sometimes, people think if they add more information to a postcard, it will help. but if there’s too much stuff, it can make the postcard confusing. people might get overwhelmed and not know what to do next. that means they might throw it away.                                                      what to do about it:                                               keep your message simple. tell people one main thing about your business. use a few words and make it easy to understand. focus on one thing you want them to know or do, like “call us today for a free trial!” or “visit our website to get your discount!” that’s all they need to know!                                                                                                 3. you tried to make it yourself instead of getting help                                                                  a lot of people try to make their own postcards. but if you don’t know how to design them well, the postcards might not look professional. a postcard that’s messy or hard to read will make people ignore it.                                                      what to do about it:                                               get help from a professional. they know how to make postcards look good and get people’s attention. a designer can make sure your postcard is easy to read and looks nice. they’ll help you say the right thing in the right way so more people will want to take action.                                                                                                 conclusion                                                                  if your postcards aren’t working, don’t give up! by choosing a clear picture, keeping the message simple, and getting help from a professional, you can make postcards that grab people’s attention and get the results you want. start making changes today, and you’ll see more people interested in your business!                                                                                     book an appointment and get 5,000 free postcards!                                                                                                      click here to book an appointment and get 5,000 postcards for free:                                                           https://qr.rsvplasvegas.com/calendlymobile/hccblog1                                                                                     about tim knifton                                                                  tim knifton is a marketing expert who has sent over 15,000,000 postcards in las vegas! he knows how to create successful postcard campaigns that help businesses grow. one of tim’s biggest achievements was helping a company earn over $2,500,000 in just six months with direct mail.                                                      tim loves helping businesses succeed with direct mail, and he continues to be a leader in the marketing world.

    why direct mail marketing is the best kept secret in 2025


 by tim knifton from rsvp las vegas
•
january 1, 2025

in 2025, even though digital marketing is everywhere, direct mail is making a big comeback! here are three reasons why sending postcards is still a smart choice for businesses:                                                                              1. direct mail stands out in a crowded world                                                                  when you check your email, you probably get tons of messages—maybe over 30 in an hour! but when you get physical mail, you only get a few pieces a day, so postcards are much easier to notice. they stand out and grab your attention right away!                                                                              2. reach people who aren’t always online                                                                  not everyone spends all their time online. direct mail postcards are great because they can reach people who don’t use the internet much, like older, wealthier demographics. this means postcards can connect with people that digital ads miss.                                                                              3. physical postcards are easy to understand                                                                  digital ads can be confusing or take time to understand, but postcards are simple. you can read them quickly and get the message right away. it’s easy to remember, so people are more likely to act on it.                                                                              in a world full of digital ads, postcards offer a fun, easy, and smart way for businesses to reach people in 2025.                                                                                                                                                                  book an appointment and get 5,000 free postcards!                                                                                                                                           click here to book an appointment and get 5,000 postcards for free:                                                                        https://qr.rsvplasvegas.com/calendlymobile/hccblog1                                                                              about tim knifton                                                                  tim knifton is a marketing expert who has sent over 15,000,000 postcards in las vegas! he knows how to create successful postcard campaigns that help businesses grow. one of tim’s biggest achievements was helping a company earn over $2,500,000 in just six months with direct mail.                                                      tim loves helping businesses succeed with direct mail, and he continues to be a leader in the marketing world.
