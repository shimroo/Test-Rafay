what is modest needs?
modest needs is a tax-exempt charity where you can make small, emergency grants to low-income workers who're at risk of slipping into poverty and for whom no other source of immediate help is available.
							since 2002, modest needs' donors have stopped the cycle of poverty for 17,552 hard-working individuals and families that conventional philanthropy otherwise had forgotten.
