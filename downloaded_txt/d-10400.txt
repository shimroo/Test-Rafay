							von schmeling						

						grand master von schmeling has been teaching martial arts for over 30 years now. his students respect him not only for his teaching style and for his tremendous experience but also for the way he helped them grow in different stages of their lives.

“one of the most valuable lessons i teach my students is how to become the best possible version of themselves.” therefore, it’s amazing to see how martial arts help kids. “it teaches them the discipline to make the right choice at the right time,” grand master von schmeling explains.

that unique view of discipline is what separates victory martial arts from other schools. “we make discipline fun.”

but what made grand master von schmeling interested in martial arts?

“lack of confidence i had as a teenager. martial arts helped me boost my confidence to build the lifestyle i have today.”

							leonardo nery						

						“martial arts build my character and guide me in all stages of my life!'' master nery starts his story.

he was just a 5 year old when he joined the martial arts world! “my parents took me to a class and i fell in love with it!”, he explains. he has been teaching for more than 30 years now.

“i love seeing students progress and grow,” he says. “training martial arts helps children develop discipline, grow self-esteem, and improve their focus and social skills.”

and his classes help kids to adopt some valuable life lessons. “structure, discipline, fun…this is how you can describe my classes. immense knowledge, so my students can apply what they’ve learned in everyday life. they become role models for others,” explains master nery.

							luiz zamboni						

						one thing master zamboni loves the most about his job is how martial arts help his students. “one of the most valuable lessons kids learn in my classes is how to overcome fears,” he explains. “it also teaches them discipline and self-esteem they need to be successful in school and life.”

and with over 30 years of teaching experience and a 7th-degree black belt, master zamboni knows how to teach these valuable lessons in the best possible way.

but not all kids join the martial arts world for fun. some, like master zamboni, join to learn how to protect themselves.

“i wanted to learn self-defense,” he says. “but martial arts have changed my life. i am who i am because of martial arts.”

							hermann von schmeling						

						master hermann von schmeling has been teaching martial arts for more than 27 years and  holds a 7th degree black belt. he first joined the martial arts world as a young boy amazed by the legacy his father created.
“one of the things i love the most about my job is our team members and families of victory,'' says master hermann von schmeling. “the delivery of the life skills and community is what separates victory martial arts from other schools.”
“at victory students learn how to be the best version of themselves through martial arts,” he explains. “they learn how to be young independent self-sufficient human beings.”
but teaching martial arts had a huge impact on his life too. “martial arts has changed my life,” says master hermann von schmeling. “i’ve been teaching these life skills and reinforcing the same values as a parent now.”

							john faett						

						master john faett struggled with the lack of confidence as a kid. “i joined the world of martial arts because i needed confidence as a kid,”starts his story master faett.

“i’ve been teaching for more than 26 years now and i have a 7th degree black belt,” he says. “ everything great in my life comes from martial arts.”

that’s why he loves helping families. “families that kick together, stick together,” he explains. “kids learn valuable skills through structure and discipline.”

and that focus on families makes victory martial arts unique. “you can’t find that family environment anywhere else,” says master faett.

here is what our students say: 










they care about the families' and kids’ well-being
"my family is having a great experience and results with victory, great staff and instructors. they care about the families and well-being of our kids. elevating our kid's confidence, discipline, self-defense and martial arts techniques."					





lorenzo m. 






my daughter has grown not only in skill but as a person…
"we've been attending classes for a year now and i have seen my daughter grow not only in skill but as a person. i've also watched many other children learn discipline, come out of their shells with newfound self-confidence, and become leaders... i can't recommend them enough. also, i have lived watching my daughter make friendships that will last a lifetime, with the other kids working their way up to blackbelts! if you are considering martial arts for yourself or your children, tell them i sent you for 2 free weeks. you absolutely won't regret it"					





c.z. 






the behavior of my child has improved
"my main concern was the discipline in my child’s life. he was a bit hyper before attending victory martial arts and had a hard time following instructions. since we’ve been coming to the school, he has made a huge improvement in his behavior and is really enjoying himself."					





t.d. 






my son has improved his behavior, sleeping, and confidence…
"i have been taking my son here for about 6 months. it has helped his behavior, sleeping, confidence, and just so many levels. like everything, practice and repetition. they not only help teach martial arts but help instill the structure, discipline, and values we teach our kids at home. positive reinforcement. waiting for my 8-month-old to get old enough to join."					





j.r. 






our daughter has improved her self-esteem and self-confidence
"we brought our daughter to victory to help her with her self-esteem, self-confidence, discipline and self-defense. it has been 13 months since she started and her teacher told us today that she is a leader in her class, helps other students, is a role model and speaks up when she has questions and to volunteer. this, from a kindergartener who would shyly, half way raise her hand to participate. thank you so much!"
