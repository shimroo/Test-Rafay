 get healthy


youâre really not healthy unless you also have a healthy gut -- hereâs how. 





















"you've got to have a workout that's 'major tough' but safe, building muscle and flexibility equally. if your workout is too extreme, it can cause injury. and if it's too safe and easy, you're not going to transform your body. lotte berk method resides in the sweet spot."
