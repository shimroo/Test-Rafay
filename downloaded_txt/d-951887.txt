    strategic plan — 2023-2025
 



   we are called to participate in the great commission of leading people into a saving relationship with the lord jesus christ. ucc administration, directors, pastors, church delegates, and executive committee have prayerfully worked together to identify 14 primary strategic goals under which we can, by god’s grace and through his holy spirit, fulfill the great commission in ucc and beyond.our desire is to also be totally open and fully surrendered to god’s miraculous leadings as we work alongside him to grow his kingdom. therefore, we anticipate him leading us to other significant special initiatives and projects as we journey with him and follow the leading of his holy spirit.

  our vision

    prayer is communicating with god: he, has the power to heal and grow you!

 
let's pray togetherpraying for god's holy spirit and his vision in your life and the life of your church is the most important activity to begin your day. as we pray for the outpouring of the holy spirit for ourselves, each member of our families and each member of our church, we know god is answering in a mighty way.
