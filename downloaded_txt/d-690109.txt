sounding the depths : on japa yoga - arjun von caemmerer.


introduction from arjun von caemmerer.
my exposure to praṇava-japa, the repetition of āuṃ, at the ramāmaṇi iyengar memorial
yoga institute (and at other iyengar yoga schools) has been limited to the 3-fold recitation of āuṃ that prefaces ‘the invocation to patañjali’ at the commencement (and
sometimes also the conclusion) of classes. in this article i wish to consider japa yoga in
more depth, particularly in its relationship to the practice of prāṇāyāma. it is noteworthy
that in patañali’s yoga-sūtra there occur almost as many sūtras on praṇava-japa as there on āsana and prāṇāyāma counted together.
