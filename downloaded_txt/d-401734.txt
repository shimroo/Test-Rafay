								generations of tradition at the chippewa flowage


our
							

nostalgic setting 
								provides you with a peaceful escape from todays 
								fast paced world.



our cottages spacious screened-in porches, 
								overlooking the wilds of the flowage,
								have comfy lounging chairs, a futon, and a table 
								and chairs where our guests
								can enjoy either playing a game or reading a good 
								book.

								provides and what to bring



							gaze out at beautiful sunrises and sunsets and enjoy the 
							haunting call of the loon.
								this is 
								a place where you can 
							refresh your soul, rekindle relationships and make new memories.













in 2019, indian trail resort was 
								nominated for the national register of historic 
								places by the wisconsin 
									historical society from madison, as 
									the best example of a fully operational, 
									well maintained, historic resort in all of 
									sawyer county.
we are truly honored by 
									this nomination as it affirms all the hard 
									work that we have done not only to preserve 
									the structures but also the atmosphere of 
									days gone by.












our resort's historic 

							little red bar was featured in the book;
 "bottoms up, a toast to wisconsin's historic bars & breweries".

come have a cold drink in our famous
							bar and let us share our tavern's unique ambiance 
							with you.
