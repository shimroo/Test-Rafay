(of illinois).  in
2004 i got my phd in

brown university, having also gotten
an scm (master of science) in cs there in 1999, and an am (master of
arts) in linguistics in 2003.
earlier on, i got a bs in cs and a bs in math from 
quincy university in may '97; prior
to college i went to
st. viator (grad. '93),
imsa (left '92), 
st. james (grad. '89), and

interests
my interests are many and varied.  for a few that i have chosen to
write about, see the links at the side of this page.  other things i'm
into include politics, diy home
improvement, and reading science fiction/fantasy.
i've long been involved in theatre.
i served for two years on the board of
prairie players civic theatre
in galesburg
and was involved backstage or onstage in several of their 
productions; since moving to virginia i've gotten involved with 
waterworks players and have
served on their board since 2012.

contact info
my main email address for general correspondence is blahedo,
right here at blahedo.org.  those of you who knew me from brown
may find it easier to remember my don_blaheta address, at
alumni.brown.edu.  i've kept a dblaheta address at
knoxalumni.org.  for professional correspondence you can use
the ugly but rule-conforming blahetadp address at
longwood.edu.
i never did get around to getting a landline phone while i lived in
galesburg, and now that "long distance" has become meaningless and "area
codes" little more than the first three digits of a ten-digit phone
number, i won't soon change my cell number,
(309) 335-6004, and probably never will.
if you're sufficiently old-fashioned to enjoy entrusting a letter
or postcard to the us postal service, it can be sent to me at

    306 garden st.
    farmville, va  23901
  
thanks for visiting!
