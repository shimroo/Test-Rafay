20 years of operation 



it all started 20 years ago with a passion for music and the local service industry scene. after securing a liquor license and renovating our location in the booming nightlife hub of pittsburgh, east carson street on the south side, the smiling moose was born.the smiling moose cranberry debuted in august of 2022. the suburban community of cranberry township welcomed us with open arms, happy to support a locally owned business with food/drinks and family atmosphere.opening the smiling moose grove city was an exciting next step allowing brewing on a much larger scale and also a tap room where we can feature our freshly brewed beers at the source and provide a local gathering place.
