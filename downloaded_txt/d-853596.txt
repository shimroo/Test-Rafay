“it finally clicked...the class has helped me learned why i must eat better, exercise and be my own voice.”





“class leaders were normal people and going through the same journey and frustrations-they didn’t lecture to me. they were easy to follow.”





“i like coming to class, everyone is going through something, the illness maybe different but the sadness and isolation of being a caregiver seems the same.”





"[a matter of balance] is a very valuable class. excellent information. very good method of appying information to daily life. thank you, this was great!"





"thank you very much for your dedication and diligence. we have greatly benefitted from the 'a matter of balance' classes!"
