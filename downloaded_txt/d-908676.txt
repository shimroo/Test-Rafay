microlensing survey


eros stands for
  'expérience pour la recherche d'objets sombres'
and has known 2 observational phases :  eros-1 (1990-1995) and eros-2 (1996-2003)

monday meeting




the list of 
available papers related to the eros experiment
 is there.


presentation :
its main objective is the search and the study of dark stellar
bodies, so-called "brown dwarfs" or "machos" which belong 
gravitationally to our galaxy. this is made possible by their 
gravitational microlensing effects on stars in the  
magellanic clouds (two dwarf galaxies, milky way satellites).  more
information is available on this page...

results of the eros sn search (1997) : 
our candidates.


macho announced a binary lens alert towards the smc
(macho-smc-98-1).here  is 
the light curve we established, starting within the caustic crossing
night (18/06/98), and zooms on
the first night.


an article
for astronomy and astrophysics giving the constraints one may extract from our
light-curve of macho-smc-98-1.
