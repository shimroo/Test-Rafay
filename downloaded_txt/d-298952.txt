we created this webpage for you, and we realize that no two people are exactly alike and neither are their problems. but it  does help to know others have had similar issues. the column at the left is designed to allow you to learn more about specific problems and issues many of us will face, one way or another in our lives. just click on the topic and it will take you to a discussion on the subject, provided by the american association of marriage and family therapists. research has clearly shown that clients who are willing to do some informative reading about their particular issue or problem, as well as partake in therapy, seem to get better faster and need fewer sessions. i hope you find  these articles helpful.
please feel welcome to give me a call or email me. i can answer questions more effectively  when i know something about your specific issues. then if it seems appropriate, we can set up an appointment in person  or for a phone session. i look forward to working with you!
