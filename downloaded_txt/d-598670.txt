larson's bakery, serving the vancouver, wa / portland, or area since 1986, is a family owned and operated business. in 1923, the larson ancestors came to america from sweden, bringing with them their family's secret recipes for the luscious baked creations found at larson's bakery. these dessert creations are baked works of art and the wedding cakes are the masterpieces of our baking artisans. be sure to visit the wedding cakes picture gallery to view examples of our wonderful wedding cakes. our baked goods are "made from scratch" and are fresh, fresh, fresh!
in our deli, the family tradition of commitment to "freshness" continues in the deli sandwiches, salads, and soups. only quality products are used to create the dishes offered at the deli and the ingredients are, of course, fresh, fresh, fresh!
in our coffee bar, you'll find an extensive variety of specialty coffees made fresh with tulley's coffee.
