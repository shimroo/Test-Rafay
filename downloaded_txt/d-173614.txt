"at 29 years old, i truly wanted to be the best version of myself, and not worry about my scalp showing. i am active in the community and live a healthy lifestyle with lots of sports routine. getting my hair back helped me improve my outlook on life. when you start taking care of yourself, you realize that life is pretty awesome."

★★★★★ 5/5 





"i feel like hair is the number one thing that makes me feel beautiful or not. however, if i have no hair, but my makeup's beautiful and i have a fabulous dress, i'm still not happy. so if i wake up, and i've got two big zits on my face, and my hair looks fierce, but i feel ok. moreover, i have a weird hair obsession."

★★★★★ 5/5 





“i'm fortunate in the sense that my hair holds curl awesomely well. most importantly, it looks the same at 10 p.m. as it does at 10 a.m.  i'm from the south - so i like big hair. in other words, nu hair of texas has the best african american wigs for women like me with hair loss."
