cbt publications
encouraging believers on the spiritual journey











home
home





cbt publications is dedicated to encouraging and assisting believers who are on the spiritual journey. we publish books, calendars, stories, poetry reflections and a blog that are designed to help believers find spiritual truth, understanding and wisdom as they navigate the sometimes confusing passage of this journey. every believer's journey has a purpose; including a beginning and an ending.











each writing offers insights discovered through revelation and experience with the pilgrimage. we encourage believers to read about, meditate on, and understand the purpose of their own journey. completing the spiritual journey allows the believer to emerge as a new being, christ-like in nature, existing on the earth, identifying with the heavenly environment, and living as purposed by god’s divine plan.
