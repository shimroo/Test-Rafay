notice:  the public works department is requesting that you and your neighbors please park your vehicles either on the same side of the road or in your driveway when possible during winter weather events. parking on both sides of the road, opposite each other, makes it difficult to maneuver our plow trucks through the roadway when clearing snow and salting the roads for your safety.
