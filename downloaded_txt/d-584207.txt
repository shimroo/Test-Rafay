 youth in jacl!















the national youth/student council (ny/sc) is a body of student and young professional leaders representing their peers on the district and national levels of the jacl. together we develop young leaders that support one another, engage in advocacy on a national level, and are empowered to make the change they want to see in their schools, workplaces, and communities.




    learn more about the ny/sc here!
  















the ypc is an affinity group within the jacl for self-identifying young professionals and provides a space for sharing experiences, building and deepening relationships, and collective growth through monthly virtual community spaces, innovative inter-chapter programming, and open forums for uplifting advocacy, resources, and encouraging direct action and dialogue.
