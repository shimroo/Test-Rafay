lyrics: 
how many times can you hear the same lie
before you start to believe it
the enemy keeps whispering to me
swear these days it’s all that i’m hearing
i used to know who i was
but now i look in the mirror and i’m not so sure
lord i don’t wanna listen to the lies anymore

the truth is i am my father’s child
i make him proud and i make him smile
i was made in the image of a perfect king
he looks at me and wouldn’t change a thing
the truth is i am truly loved 
by a god who’s good when i’m not good enough
i don’t belong to the lies
i belong to you
and that’s the truth

when i feel like there’s so much noise
living rent free in my head
heaven finds me and a still small voice
and it sounds like grace instead
you remind who i am 
when i look in the mirror and i’m not so sure
lord i don’t want to listen to the lies anymore

the truth is i am my father’s child
i make him proud and i make him smile
i was made in the image of a perfect king
he looks at me and wouldn’t change a thing
the truth is i am truly loved 
by a god who’s good when i’m not good enough
i don’t belong to the lies
i belong to you
and that’s the truth

i know who i am
because i know who you are
and i hold your truth inside of my heart

i know the lies are always gonna try and find me
but i’ve never been so sure
the truth is i am my father’s child
i make him proud and i make him smile
i was made in the image of a perfect king
he looks at me and wouldn’t change a thing
the truth is i am truly loved 
by a god who’s good when i’m not good enough
i don’t belong to the lies
i belong to you
and that’s the truth
and that’s the truth

lyrics: 
i wanna dance like david
i wanna faith like paul
i wanna sing like silas tearing down the prison walls
i wanna face that fire
it won’t burn me though
god’s got my back shadrach meshach abednego

i wanna walk like moses
right through the waves
one day i’ll see that promise land, no longer slaves
though the fear is talkin’, no it can’t take out my faith

i’m gonna praise
i’m gonna praise
i praise the mountain movin’ body raising breaker of chains
gonna praise
i’m gonna praise
i praise the heaven seated undefeated highest of names
that’s who i praise (hey)
that’s who i praise
that’s who i praise

i wanna gift like mary
i wanna break my vase
i wanna sleep like daniel even in a lion’s cave
i’m gonna get that promise
just like jericho
yea i know what’ll make it fall

i’m gonna praise
i’m gonna praise
i praise the mountain movin’ body raising breaker of chains
gonna praise
i’m gonna praise
i praise the heaven seated undefeated highest of names
that’s who i praise
hey
i praise the god who’s proven he can do impossible things
that’s who i praise
hey
that’s who i praise
that’s who i praise

he is the lion of judah
he is the lamb that was slain
the only one who’s worthy
worthy
worthy of all of his names
that’s who i praise
he is the risen messiah
he is the ancient of days
the only one who’s worthy
worthy
worthy of all of his names 
that’s who i praise

so i’m gonna praise
i praise the mountain movin’ body raising breaker of chains
gonna praise
i’m gonna praise
i praise the heaven seated undefeated highest of names
that’s who i praise
hey
i praise the god who’s proven he can do impossible things
that’s who i praise
hey
that’s who i praise

that kinda grace
i wanna live like i’ve got no more precious time to waste
i’m gonna give him glory
with all my thanks
‘cause there’s no greater, stronger higher name and
that’s who i praise

lyrics:
fears got me living with the lights out
chained down like a prisoner in my own house
shame cycles like a daily medication
i try but i can’t change my situation

cause the liar comes to rob my joy
yeah i’m bruised but i’m not destroyed
i’m rising like an army
and you’re gonna hear the sound

i’m calling the angels down
i’m storming the gates of hell
tell the devil he don’t own my soul
i’m taking back what the enemy stole

i’m raising the battle cry
i’m holding the banner high
with the power of the holy ghost
i’m taking back what the enemy stole

oh, oh, oh

you can’t speak the lies over my family, no
you can’t break the promises that are standing, no
ain’t gotta flex to put your back in place now
one name is all i gotta say
jesus

i’m calling the angels down
i’m storming the gates of hell
tell the devil he don’t own my soul
i’m taking back what the enemy stole

i’m raising the battle cry
i’m holding the banner high
with the power of the holy ghost (holy ghost)
i’m taking back what the enemy stole (what the enemy stole, yeah)

(taking my peace back, yeah)
(taking my joy back)

take it all back
take it all back
i’m taking back what the enemy stole

uh huh we’re done with all the mind games you try to play
if ain’t clear yet i want everything you took from me
in the name of the one who is peace, the one who heals all disease
the only reason that i am free, that name is jesus
lord of lords and king of kings
jesus
the name that makes the demons flee
i want it all now, i’m taking it back now
yeah you know it’s going down when you hear the sound

i’m calling the angels down
i’m storming the gates of hell
tell the devil he don’t own my soul
i’m taking back what the enemy stole

i’m raising the battle cry (i’m raising a battle cry)
i’m holding the banner high (i’m waving the banner high)
with the power of the holy ghost (oh)
i’m taking back what the enemy stole (what the enemy stole, woo)

oh, oh, oh

(oh)
(yeah, imma take it all back)
(taking it all back)
(take it all back, take it all back)

i’m taking back what the enemy stole
(what the enemy stole)
(woo)
(oh, oh, oh)
(taking my peace back)
(taking my joy back)
(nah you can’t have that)

i’m taking back what the enemy stole

oh, oh, oh

lyrics: 
somebody prayed
every night there by your bed
you fold your hands and bow your head
throwing out another prayer in faith
when you wonder if he’s hearing you
look at me i’m living proof
i’m only right where i am today
because somebody prayed

so i hit my knees
cause i’ve seen all heaven move
(don’t matter if you hit rock bottom,
my god pick you up when you call him)
i pray, father please
cause i’ve seen what he can do
(don’t matter if the storm cloud coming,
my god come through when you call him)
these hands have no power
but there ain’t an hour he don’t come through
that’s why when mountains move i say
looks like somebody prayed

for the child of god that’s far from home
the one who thinks they’re too far gone
i’m throwing out another prayer in faith
worn out altars, tear stained pews
still i won’t give up on you
i believe that anything can change
when somebody prays

i’ve seen miracles come from feeble words
i’ve seen hospital rooms turned into cathedrals
and i’ve seen freedom come to the prisoner
you can’t tell me that prayer don’t work

every night there by your bed
when you fold your hands and bow your head
not a single word you’ve ever said in vain
cause he hears everything

lyrics:
your word is a lamp unto my feet
your way is the only way for me
it’s a narrow road that leads to life
but i want to be on it
 
it’s a narrow road but the mercy’s wide
‘cause you’re good on your promise
 
i’ll take you at your word
if you said it i’ll believe it
i’ve seen how good it works
if you start it you’ll complete it
i’ll take you at your word
 
you spoke and the chaos fell in line
well i know ‘cause i’ve seen it in my life
it’s a narrow road that leads to life, but i want to be on it
it’s a narrow road, the tide is high ‘cause you parted the water
 
you’re good on your promise
you’re good on your promise
 
you said your love will never give up
you said your grace is always enough
you said your heart would never forget or forsake me
 
you said i’m saved, you call me yours
you said my future’s full of your hope
you’ve never failed so i know that you’ll never fail me

lyrics:
you had a light
till somebody stole it
the words that they said cut you like a knife
they called you a name you started to own it
you hear the echoes in the dead of night
:
tired of the cheap shots 
comin at you nonstop
leavin’ marks on your heart 
like a tattoo
drowning on the inside
reaching for a lifeline
let these be the words that you hold on to 

you are loved
chosen
long before the day you were born
you are held
forgiven
treasured more than you’ll ever know
when the lies get loud
let the truth ring out
till the only thing you’re listening to
is what he says about you

and if the hands 
that gave you a heartbeat 
are the same hands that painted the stars 
then child of the one true god 
tell me how could you not
believe that you’re a work of art

the only thing that matters

lyrics:
(oh-oh-oh-oh)
(oh-oh-oh-oh)

i was an orphan
defined by mistakes
thought i was forsaken
that you gave up the chase
i went to the reaches 
to try and ease the ache
turned my back on the one
who kept calling my name
you kept calling

didn’t matter where i was at
you just kept calling me back

back to the table
back to my home
back to my father who never lost hope
for the first time in ages
i know what to do
with my arms wide open i’m running to back to you 

(oh-oh-oh-oh)
i’m running to back to you 
(oh-oh-oh-oh)

now i have been rescued
my soul is remade
but even the ransomed
can fall on their face
when i’m drowning in questions
when i’ve lost the path
your love is the answer
you’re calling me back

back to the table
back to my home
back to my father who never lets go
whatever i’m facing
i know what to do
with my arms wide open i’m running to back to you 

(oh-oh-oh-oh)
i’m running to back to you 
(oh-oh-oh-oh)

it doesn’t matter all the times where i’ve been in over my head
i’m never too far gone where your arms cannot pull me back again
i’m never been so lost where your love could not fill my emptiness
i’m never too far gone where your arms cannot pull me back again

back to the table
back to my home
back to my father who never lets go
whatever i’m facing
i know what to do
with my arms wide open i’m running to back to you
back to the table
back to my home
back to my father who never lost hope
for the first time in ages
i know what to do
with my arms wide open i’m running to back to you

(oh-oh-oh-oh)
i’m running to back to you 
(oh-oh-oh-oh)
i’m running to back to you 
(oh-oh-oh-oh) oh-oh-oh-oh
i’m running back to you
(oh-oh-oh-oh)
i’m running to back to you

lyrics:
you’ve been trying hard to bear
the weight of all your shame
and if there’s a god up there
you’re sure he forgot your name
when your steps are getting heavy
and hope looks all but lost
just bring it all to the cross

who told you grace can’t reach
the messed up ones like you
has the devil made you believe
the lies he tells are true
when you’re sure that you’re the one
who’s wandered too far off
it’s not too late
just come home to the cross

come and see a savior’s love
that would die to make you new
nothing you have ever done
can change what mercy’s done for you
and if you ever wonder
if you’re worth so great a cost
look up and see
the cross

everybody’s got a list
at least a mile long
of every scar and every sin
from everywhere that we’ve gone wrong
but there’s reason for rejoicing
and the reason is because
that list was nailed to the cross

he was wounded for your wounds
pierced for all your sin
by his stripes you are healed
died so you could rise again
he let the blood and water flow
and did it all to let you know
you’re the reason that he went
to the cross
oh he’s calling you to run home to
the cross
