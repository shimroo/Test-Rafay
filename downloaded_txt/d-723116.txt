testimonials



"such a relief to find someone we can
                            trust."i was initially a bit hesitant about making large financial
                        agreements on-line, but i am so glad we did! our local bank representative takes sometimes a
                        week to return a call or email and  phil barker
                            at life annuities.com is on top of things, always
                        the same day responses. i have not seen this level of customer service for years!! phil
                        explained the different choices with kindness and patience and helped me to understand the pros
                        and cons for each. once the decision was, he followed up right away. almost a year later, when
                        my husband decided to move his rrif to a life annuity phil barker at life annuities was the only
                        one we even considered!! the quotes came in quickly, paperwork was accurate, process was
                        seamless and the first payment in our bank the following month. thanks so much phil for the
                        excellent service!

"he was prompt, friendly and kind as well
                            as effective."

i no longer wanted to be in the market and was advised by a fee only financial advisor to
                        consider annuities. i worked with phil barker
                            at life annuities and he was terrific. he was
                        prompt, friendly and kind as well as effective. he found even better annuities than i expected.
                        i recommend him unreservedly. i found life annuities cost effective and easy to work with.
