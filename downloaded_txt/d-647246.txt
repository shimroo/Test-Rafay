getting started











protecting families for generations
knights of columbus insurance provides long-term financial security to brother knights and their family members, we have been protecting catholic families for generations.
for catholic families across arizona seeking financial security, the raso agency provides a complete portfolio of highly competitive insurance products, backed by a 140-year tradition of protecting the family: the knights of columbus global catholic fraternal service organization.
grounded in the knights’ core principles of charity, unity, fraternity and patriotism, nate raso and his state-wide team are fourth degree members of the knights; they consider their collective knowledge of the insurance industry as more than a profession, but as a ministry.
