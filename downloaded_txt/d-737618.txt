    questions? 
 
frequently asked questions (and their answers)


    
     can i swim off the boat?

   




  no, there is no swimming possible from any rental boat on big bear lake as per the lake law. all swimming activities must be conducted within 50 ft of shore, however rental boats must stay in the middle of the 5 mile per hour zone of the lake which is approximately 200-300 ft away from shore and marked with white cylindrical buoys. we will be happy to point out some swimming areas on your map once you have returned from your rental!



   can i beach the boat or dock it somewhere else?

   




  no, all rental boats must stay in the middle of the 5 mile per hour zone of the lake which is approximately 200-300 ft away from shore and marked with white cylindrical buoys. the shoreline of big bear lake is beautiful, but even in areas that look sandy or have docks, there are lots of boulders, weeds, and debris that hide just under the surface of the water. the lake level is regularly low, which may render certain docks unusable. to keep you having fun and to keep our boats afloat and running their best, we ask that you respect the distance rules and keep to deeper water. we’re happy to point out our favorite areas that you can enjoy safely - just ask at the dock!



   can i drink alcohol onboard the boat?

   




  yes! however, you must also bring a designated driver who will remain sober. boaters must follow the same laws as cars, and you can and will get a dui for driving a boat under the influence. we encourage you to enjoy yourselves responsibly! 



   can i bring food and beverages onboard?

   




  yes, absolutely! this is one of our top-recommended activities. no restaurant will have better views than your own private boat on the water. ask us about table rentals if you would like to add one to your rental for this purpose. additionally, our staff is ready with a list of favorite local eateries if you want to pick up some take-out on your way.



   can i rent a boat and a waverunner at the same time??

   




  no. this is a matter of safety. the majority of collisions that happen on this lake occur between parties who know one another. for this reason, we don’t rent a boat and a waverunner, or more than one boat to parties that know one another, nor do we rent to customers who already have their own vessels on the water. we want all of our guests to have a great time while remaining safe and keeping our rentals in the best possible condition for all of our future guests as well. if we find out that you have violated this rental condition, our policy is to immediately revoke the rental and lake patrol will return you to the dock with no refund. we hate to be the bummer, so please be honest and respect this one. 



   can i tow a tube or waterskier (etc) behind my rental vessel??

   




  no, unfortunately on big bear lake it is illegal to tow anything behind a rental vessel. however, we do offer this as a charter service with professional drivers and instructors if you want to brush up on your wakeboarding, waterskiing, wakesurfing and more. if you want to get out for some laughs on a tube, we’re plenty happy to book you a tubing charter as well!



   i have a large party - can i rent 2 boats?

   




  no. this is a matter of safety. the majority of collisions that happen on this lake occur between parties who know one another. for this reason, we don’t rent a boat and a waverunner, or more than one boat to parties that know one another, nor do we rent to customers who already have their own vessels on the water. we want all of our guests to have a great time while remaining safe and keeping our rentals in the best possible condition for all of our future guests as well. if we find out that you have violated this rental condition, our policy is to immediately revoke the rental and lake patrol will return you to the dock with no refund. we hate to be the bummer, so please be honest and respect this one. instead, consider splitting your party and go out on the water in two shifts. we have a small beach area that you are more than welcome to use for the duration of your rental while you wait. our dockhands will be happy to help you switch out your group at the dock one time during your rental period. if you have a significantly larger group, consider chartering our pirate ship for a private tour. the pirate ship can accommodate up to 25 people, comes with a captain, and a guided tour if you so desire. call either north shore landing or holloway’s marina and rv park or go online at bigbearhollowaysmarina.com for a private charter booking.



   what's the minimum age to rent? who can drive?

   




  you must be 18 or older with a valid driver’s license and credit card to rent or drive any vessels with us. passengers can be any age as long as minors are approved and signed for by a parent or guardian. 



   what if i'm late?

   




  we book your reservation as a time slot, not a duration of time, because we book rentals back to back throughout the day. for example, if you book a 2 hour rental from 2-4pm, then you have reserved the boat only from 2-4pm, and there is likely someone else at the dock ready to pick up the boat for their 4:15 pm reservation. in this case we cannot adjust your time without cutting into theirs. in short, if you are late, you will be cutting into your own rental time. we advise that all guests plan to arrive at least an hour ahead of your scheduled rental time, and keep an eye on the traffic. if you are going to be late, give us a call to let us know. we will do everything in our power to accommodate you (short of taking time away from another customer).



   what if i need to cancel?

   




  please refer to your booking for the cancelation policy. our standard policy is to fully refund any cancelation made 48 hours or more in advance, however that may vary depending on what kind of reservation you have.



   how long does it take to ger around the entire lake?

   




  at full speed most of our pontoon rentals can get around the entire lake in about 90 minutes, however we recommend a longer rental to go at a leisurly pace and explore a bit. 2 hours is a sweet spot with young kids. if you're bringing a picnic lunch and chilling out, 3 hours can fly by. 



   how big is the lake? how deep is it?

   




  when completely full, big bear lake is 7 miles long and about a 1/2 mile wide. at the west end it can get up to 80 feet deep, but the east end averages about 20-30 feet deep. it's big enough to explore, but not so big that you get lost.
