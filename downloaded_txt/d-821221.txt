axis tilt is the reason
[dec. 21st, 2006|10:17 pm]
joe




ok since jesus is not the reason for the season, no matter how many churches think it is. there is nothing saying jesus was born on december 25th, in fact the christian church just made it decemeber 25th to replace the winter solstice, a pagan holiday. so just remember kids, axis tilt is the reason for the season, not jesus, not crop gathering in keyna, nor burning some light oil for 9 days. the planet you are living on is just tilting to give the northern hemisphere 3 more months of cold, snowy weather.by the way i made this...

is this what christians believe?
[nov. 8th, 2006|01:47 pm]
joe




honestly, this is by far one of the most offensive pictures i've seen and if you know me i don't get offend easily. how dare you teach your little kids that it's ok to praise tragety? the only person we should thank for september 11th is bin ladin, and by thank i mean ram a tomahawk cruise missle up his arab ass. i'm sure that's good upstanding values to praise the loss of lives of brave firefighters and other emergency worker, not to mention the thousand of office worker who died. if i ever seen anyone hold a sign like this anywhere near me i will kick their ass eight ways to sunday. not to mention if i see it at a solider's funeral and they are holding a sign thanking god for killing the solider i will really have to beat there ass. this is why christians are idiots, they believe in shit like this and it disgusts me.that mother should have her children taken away from her, she is a unfit mother.

arguement for god
[nov. 3rd, 2006|06:37 am]
joe




these are some of the most compelling arguments for the existence of god that i have ever come across. and since some of you seem to lack the ability to tell the difference: yes, that was sarcasm...cosmological argument (1) if i say something must have a cause, it has a cause. (2) i say the universe must have a cause. (3) therefore, the universe has a cause. (4) therefore, god exists. ontological argument (i) (1) i define god to be x. (2) since i can conceive of x, x must exist. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from miracles (1) my aunt had cancer. (2) the doctors gave her all these horrible treatments. (3) my aunt prayed to god and now she doesn\'t have cancer. (4) therefore, god exists. moral argument (i) (1) person x, a well-known atheist, was morally inferior to the rest of us. (2) therefore, god exists. moral argument (ii) (1) in my younger days i was a cursing, drinking, smoking, gambling, child-molesting, thieving, murdering, bed-wetting bastard. (2) that all changed once i became religious. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from creation, a.k.a. argument from personal incredulity (i) (1) if evolution is false, then creationism is true, and therefore god exists. (2) evolution can\'t be true, since i lack the mental capacity to understand it; moreover, to accept its truth would cause me to be uncomfortable. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from fear (1) if there is no god then we\'re all going to die. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from the bible (1) [arbitrary passage from ot] (2) [arbitrary passage from nt] (3) therefore, god exists. argument from intelligence (1) look, there\'s really no point in me trying to explain the whole thing to you stupid atheists — it\'s too complicated for you to understand. god exists whether you like it or not. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from unintelligence (1) okay, i don\'t pretend to be as intelligent as you guys — you\'re obviously very well read. but i read the bible, and nothing you say can convince me that god does not exist. i feel him in my heart, and you can feel him too, if you\'ll just ask him into your life. \"for god so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son into the world, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish from the earth.\" john 3:16. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from belief (1) if god exists, then i should believe in him. (2) i believe in god. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from intimidation (1) see this bonfire? (2) therefore, god exists. parental argument (1) my mommy and daddy told me that god exists. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from numbers (1) millions and millions of people believe in god. (2) they can\'t all be wrong, can they? (3) therefore, god exists. argument from guitar mastery (1) eric clapton is god. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from incomprehensibility (1) flabble glurk zoom boink blubba snurgleschnortz ping! (2) no one has ever refuted (1). (3) therefore, god exists. argument from american evangelism (1) telling people that god exists makes me filthy rich. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from blindness (i) (1) atheists are spiritually blind. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from blindness (ii) (1) god is love. (2) love is blind. (3) stevie wonder is blind. (4) therefore, stevie wonder is god. (5) therefore, god exists. argument from smugness (1) god exists. (2) i don\'t give a crap whether you believe it or not; i have better things to do than to try to convince you morons. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from manifestations (1) if you turn your head sideways and squint a little, you can see an image of a bearded face in that tortilla. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from incomplete devastation (1) a plane crashed killing 143 passengers and crew. (2) but one child survived with only third-degree burns. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from possible worlds (1) if things had been different, then things would be different. (2) that would be bad. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from sheer will (1) i do believe in god! i do believe in god! i do i do i do i do believe in god! (2) therefore, god exists. argument from nonbelief (1) the majority of the world\'s population are nonbelievers in christianity. (2) this is just what satan intended. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from post-death experience (1) person x died an atheist. (2) he now realizes his mistake. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from emotional blackmail (1) god loves you. (2) how could you be so heartless to not believe in him? (3) therefore, god exists. argument from sacrificial blackmail (1) jesus died for your sins. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from incoherent babble (1) see that person spazzing on the church floor babbling incoherently? (2) that\'s how infinite wisdom reveals itself. (3) therefore, god exists. oprah\'s argument (i) (1) the human spirit exists. (2) therefore, god exists. oprah\'s argument (ii) (1) check out this video segment. (2) now how can anyone watch that and not believe in god? (3) therefore, god exists. calvinist argument, a.k.a. tertullian\'s argument (1) if god exists, then he will let me watch you be tortured forever. (2) i rather like that idea. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from uppercase assertion (1) god exists! get used to it! (2) therefore, god exists. argument from infinite regress (1) ask atheists what caused the big bang. (2) regardless of their answer, ask how they know this. (3) continue process until the atheist admits he doesn\'t know the answer to one of your questions. (4) you win! (5) therefore, god exists. argument from history (1) the bible is true. (2) therefore, the bible is historical fact. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from resurrection (1) proof of god\'s existence will be available when you rise bodily from your grave. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from biogenesis (1) where did adam come from, dummy?

(6) [atheist\'s counterargument] (7) yes he does!!! (8) [atheist gives up and goes home.] (9) therefore, god exists. argument from creative interpretation (1) god is: (a) the feeling you have when you look at a newborn baby. (b) the love of a mother for her child. (c) that little still voice in your heart. (d) humankind\'s potential to overcome their difficulties. (e) how i feel when i look at a sunset. (f) the taste of ice cream on a hot day. (2) therefore, god exists. argument from insecurity (1) we have gone to absolutely berserk lengths to establish that atheists are laughable morons. (1.5) actually, we did so in the hopes of curing our own insecurities about theism — but there\'s no chance in hell we\'ll ever admit that. (2) therefore, atheists are laughable morons. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from superiority (1) if god does not exist, then i am an inferior being, since i am not \"special\" in a cosmic sense. (2) but i am superior because i am a christian. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from perfection (1) if there are absolute moral standards, then god exists. (2) atheists say that there are no absolute moral standards. (3) but that\'s because they don\'t want to admit to being sinners. (4) therefore, there are absolute moral standards. (5) therefore, god exists. argument from human necessity (1) atheists say that they don\'t need god. (2) which just goes to show that they need god. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from hidden logic (i) (1) intellectually, i know that the existence of god is impossible, or vastly improbable. (2) but i must put on the appearance of being cool and intellectual in front of my christian apologist peers. (3) therefore, i must pretend that (1) is false. (4) therefore, god exists. argument from hidden logic (ii) (1) atheists say that god doesn\'t exist. (2) but they only say that because they want to look cool and intellectual in front of their peers. (3) they don\'t fool me! (4) therefore, god exists. argument from indulgence (1) atheists like to think that they can control their emotional desires. (2) but they\'re atheists, so they can\'t. (3) therefore, atheists feel the need to indulge in whatever they feel like without worrying about committing sin. (4) this just goes to show how they need god in their lives. (5) therefore, god exists. argument from hate (1) some atheists hate christians and christianity. (2) that\'s why they don\'t believe in god. (3) pathetic, aren\'t they? (4) therefore, god exists. argument from kent hovind\'s challenge (1) kent hovind offers $250,000 (which may or may not exist) to anyone who can demonstrate evolution (defined as a natural, acausal origin of the universe) to a reasonable doubt (meaning with 100% certainty, allowing for no other possibilities whatsoever) in front of a neutral committee (handpicked by hovind himself) and according to certain criteria (carefully worded so as to rule out any possibility whatsoever of the challenge ever being met). (2) no atheist has ever met this challenge. (3) therefore, god exists. argument from insanity (1) no sane person could have thought up christianity. (2) therefore, it must be true (3) therefore, god exists. argument from biblical history (1) many modern historians think that there probably was somebody named jesus, maybe. (2) therefore, god exists.

funny yet true
[nov. 1st, 2006|06:40 am]
joe




so this is not to just rag on the president but to rag on christians all over the place. please read this and tell me if it could possibly be wrong. by the way this is not the work of myself."dear president bush,thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding god's law. i have learned a great deal from you, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as i can. when someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, i simply remind them that leviticus 18:22 clearly rejects it...end of debate.i do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of god's law and how to follow them:1.) leviticus 25:44 states that i may possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. a friend of mine claims that this applies to mexicans, but not canadians. can you clarify? why can't i own canadians?2.) i would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in exodus 21:7. in this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?3.) i know that i am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness, leviticus 15: 19-24. the problem is, how do i tell? i have tried asking, but most women take offense.4.) when i burn a bull on the alter as a sacrafice, i know it creates a pleasing odor for the lord- leviticus 1:9. the problem is, my neighbors. they claim the odor is not pleasing to them. should i smite them?5.) i have a neighbor who insists on working on the sabbath. exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. am i morally obligated to kill him myself, or should i ask the police to do it?6.) a friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination-leviticus 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. i don't agree. can you settle this? are there degrees of abomination?7.) leviticus 21:10 states that i may not approach the altar of god if i have a defect in my sight. i have to admit that i wear reading glasses. does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle-room here?8.) most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by leviticus 19:27. how should they die?9.) i know from leviticus 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may i still play football if i wear gloves?10.) my uncle has a farm. he violates leviticus 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). he also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them?-leviticus 24:10-16. couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair, as we do with people who sleep with their in-laws-leviticus 20:14,?i know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so i am confident you can help. thank you again for reminding us that god's word is eternal and unchanging."

election 2006
[oct. 30th, 2006|09:49 pm]
joe




as we prepare to vote in a little over a week, i've started to think about this election for governor and have come to one conclusion, no matter who wins the state of michigan is screwed. granholm has done nothing but drive this state futher into the ground, we have the worst unemployment rate out of any state, we have some stupid taxes like that on small business which affects my mom, our education system sucks, and our gas prices and road conditions don't match up, i mean if i'm paying all this gas tax for the roads i expect a decent driving surface. i think it's a bunch of rubbish that we allowed a bloody canadian in our government and have the notion that she knows what is right for a chunk of american land. maybe i should try to get into the ontario government, at least the trash flow would stop. now before you think i'm some whacked out republican, i'm not, i can't, i won't vote for devos either. he's not going to one bit of good for michigan either. he's to conservative and won't do anything progessive for michigan, this is what happens when you get some no good christian in power. devos hasn't done anything worth while to prove to me he'll be an effective leader. see devos has bush syndrom thinking god has inspried them to lead the people into the promise land, if only he would realize that if there is a god, and there is more then likely not, that you shouldn't create policies based on your faith. abortion and gay marriage are none of our damn business and it certianly shouldn't be the business of the government, devos is in favor of banning both. this is why i think a majority of christians are some of the most ignorant people in the united states, don't force your religion into the peoples governement, least we forget the seperation of church and state.also one thing that really bugs me about these so called "leaders" is that they can't say anything good, all the ads on tv just says how bad the other one is and doesn't actually say what either are for. i can only assume that devos has a weak plan for michigan, and i know that granholm is a terriable leader. but what am i going to do? you have to vote right? well i could say i will vote for the lesser of two evils and that being devos, but why should i be forced to? well i'm not voting for the lesser of two evils, i am voting for the man that should be the next governor but won't be, never the less i will be casting my ballot for greg creswell.mr. creswell is one very well spoken black man who is highly educated, i actually got a chance to meet him at ou the other day. anyways he wants to cut the taxes and cut the stupid spending that our state does, he wants the mcri to pass...this is a black man who thinks everyone should be equal, he wants to get michigan's economy going again, and he believes in letting the people take back control of their government, all good, solid, libertarian veiws. so think before you vote, do you really want the lesser of two evils in office?

god damn weather
[oct. 12th, 2006|12:23 pm]
joe




screw michigan, it's only october and the snow is sticking. i hate cold weather, snow, and anything the has to do with winter. but really i know why it's doing this, see us michiganders said that it will be a cold day in hell before the tigers win the world series, well considering hell is about an hours drive from where i live i guess we would get hit with the surrounding strom now wouldn't we? the tigers aren't going to lose, they are playing to well, and even through i think baseball is by far the most borning thing in the world to watch, i will be cheering for the home town after they beat the a's tomarrow night. christ almighty, lets just hope this snow thing is not for long because i still have outside projects i'd like to do. and seriously anyone who says global warming is happen is nuts, i've freezing my ass off and it's snowing for christ sake. last year it was actually pretty nice around this time, a little chilly but not to bad.
