custom silicone bracelets frequently asked questions





how much do you charge for custom bracelets?



the per band price varies depending on the style, design, quantity, and desired delivery date for the bracelets that you’re ordering. please see the pricing page for the base price of each bracelet style at different quantities.





what is your turn-around time for customized bracelets?



silicone bracelets with the "fast van" logo are eligible for rush production at an additional cost and can arrive in 2-3 business days. we deliver most other custom bracelets in 3 weeks. you will be shown an estimated delivery date before you place your order.





what silicone bracelet sizes do you offer?



our custom silicone bracelets come in two main sizes: medium and large. some styles, like our classic colorfill, are also available in size small or x-large.if you would like a cut-out for measuring rubber bracelet sizes on your wrist, print the reminderband sizing page.





what silicone bracelet styles are available?



we offer four main rubber bracelet styles: engraved (debossed), printed, luxe, and embossed. engraved bracelets feature lettering that is engraved into the surface of the silicone bracelet. we also offer colorfill bracelets that have silicone injected into the engraved message for contrast. printed bracelets have flat, silk-screen printed lettering. the luxe bracelet is a two-layer band that is engraved through to reveal the underlayer color for your message. embossed bracelets have raised silicone lettering. please visit our specifications page for more information.





can i add a logo or artwork to my customized bracelets?



yes! you can choose graphics from our free art library or upload custom artwork to our silicone bracelet maker, or band builder, for an additional fee. uploaded art must be single-color, and works best if it is simple in design, with no fine lines or tiny letters.





can i order multiple colors and sizes of my custom bracelets with the same phrase?



yes, but only if your bracelet style has no minimum quantity required. select the ‘add item’ button on step 3 of the customizer to add additional sizes or colors of your rubber bracelet design.





how long will the personalized rubber bracelets and engravings last?



while we generally warranty our silicone bracelets for up to 30 days, they will last well beyond that. our luxe and printed bracelets will show gradual wear with time, depending on environmental conditions. custom rubber bracelets with colorfill have a much longer-lasting imprint.





what is your minimum order quantity on custom silicone bracelets?



some of our rubber bracelets, such as the colorfill and classic styles, have no minimum order quantity. others may have a required minimum order quantity as indicated by icons on our wristbands page.





what silicone bracelet engraving areas are available?



up to 30 characters including spaces and punctuation are allowed per line. pricing includes side 1, but you can add customization to side 2 (the opposing outer surface) for an additional cost. we don’t offer a “full wrap” or engrave on the inside of the custom bracelet.





can i change my rubber bracelet order once it has been submitted?



once your order has begun production it cannot be changed or canceled. if you've made an error on your custom bracelets or need to make a change, please contact us immediately to see what the best recourse is.





will my customized bracelets be identical to the band builder image?



the rendered image in our silicone bracelet creator and emailed confirmation is not an exact representation of the final product. the actual size of the font and art may vary, as well as the exact color shade of the bracelet.





do you send samples of your custom bracelets?



yes! just contact us with the type of bracelet and color you’re interested in, and we will try to find a similar rubber bracelet we can send you. please note that we do charge a $5 fee to cover shipping.





what are your custom bracelets made of?



reminderband® silicone bracelets are made of 100% latex-free, hypoallergenic silicone. for more detailed information visit our wristband specifications page.





what's the difference between rubber bracelets and silicone bracelets?



there is none! commonly referred to as rubber bracelets, our custom silicone wristbands are still made with 100% silicone.





can i choose a custom bracelet color for my customized bracelets?



yes, we offer custom pantone bracelet colors, but please note there is a minimum order of 200 pieces for each size and color. please call 1-435-258-9833 or contact us with additional questions.





how can i reorder the same silicone bracelet design if i need more?



if you create a login account you can use the “reorder” button in your order history. if you checked out as a guest, email us or call in with your previous order number and we can assist you with a reorder. please note that there may be slight variations in font size and bracelet color due to changes in production processes.





do you offer donations or discounts for custom bracelets to non-profit organizations or charities?



while we do not offer donations, our discounts are provided in the form of significant price breaks at certain quantities, resulting in reduced cost per bracelet. we may also offer limited seasonal coupons or promo codes.





are taxes and duties paid for on international silicone bracelet orders?



customers with orders shipping outside of the united states are responsible for payment of all taxes, duties, and customs fees.





what are the meanings of each rubber bracelet color?



silicone bracelets have colors with meaning for tons of causes, diseases, events, and more. learn about the most common uses with our guide on wristband color meanings.
