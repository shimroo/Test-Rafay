stereotypes
i was talking to a friend the other day about sterotypes. when i was a kid, all the jokes were "irish jokes" but other people can remember "polish jokes" or "blonde jokes". well this friend suggested that we need some segment of society which is completely despised and unloved and therefore suitable for joking about.....
the two options we came up with were politicians and lawyers. the problem is that politicians are already jokes and lawyers doesn't always work.....
the example joke was one of the favourites in my house as a kid:
well there was this irishman who went to work with one red sock and one green sock on. his boss said to him: "hey, you have one red sock and one green sock on". the man responded "yes. and i have another pair like this at home"....
when my grandfather went to india he got off the plane and was greeted by an old friend who told him the latest joke going around:
well there was this seik who went to work with one red sock and one green sock....
try it with a lawyer:
well there was this irishman who went to work with one red sock and one green sock on. his boss said to him: "hey, you have one red sock and one green sock on". the man responded "yes. i'll see you in court."....
hmmmm.

social works and lightbulbs....
how many social workers does it take to change a light bulb?
1) "the light bulb doesn't need changing, it's the system that needs to change."
2) none. social workers never change anything.
3) none. they empower it to change itself!
4) none. the light bulb is not burnt out, it's just differently lit.
5) none. they set up a team to write a paper on coping with darkness.
6) two. one to change the bulb and another to put your kids into care.
7) five. one to screw it in, three to form the support group, and one to help with placement.

the less you know, the more you get paid...
it's widely held that ignorance rises to the executive level, with a concurrent rise in pay; but, until now, we've had only anecdotal evidence of such. well, finally, a formal proof is to be had.
1) axiom - knowledge is power
2) axiom - time is money
3) power = work / time (classical physics)
4) knowledge = work / money (substitution)
therefore, money = work / knowledge.
thus, for any given amount of work, money approaches infinity as knowledge approaches zero!

right, now we know where we went wrong. pursuit of knowledge and not power! damn!

college graduates
a young man was hired by a supermarket and reported for his first day of work. the manager greeted him with a warm handshake and a smile, then gave him a broom and said,
"son, your first job will be to sweep out the store."
"but i'm a college graduate," the young man replied indignantly.
"oh, i'm sorry. i didn't realise that," said the manager. "here, give me the broom -- i'll show you how."

lawyer jokes
what's wrong with lawyer jokes?
lawyers don't think they're funny, and nobody else thinks they're jokes.

building site accident....
a bunch of guy's were working on a 50 story construction site, a guy working at the top acciddently knocked a brick off the 50th story, when looking down he saw that his boss was in line for the brick to land on his noggin and briskly yelled, "brick".
the boss looked up after hearing the yell and moved to one side as the brick crashed to the ground. he then yelled to the worker, "a $100 bonus for you laddy".
another guy working a floor below had observed what went down with the brick and decided he'd have a go for a $100 bonus, the problem was he was a bit of a stutterer, as he kicked the brick off the side of the building he looked down and yelled with a loud voice, "bbbbbbbbbbbbbb  bugger.  too late."

the graveyard...
two men were walking home after a party and decided to take a shortcut through the cemetery just for laughs.
right in the middle of the cemetery they were startled by a tap-tap-tapping noise coming from the misty shadows. trembling with fear, they found an old man with a hammer and chisel, chipping away at one of the headstones.
"holy cow, mister," one of them said after catching his breath, "you scared us half to death ... we thought you were a ghost! what are you doing working here so late at night?"
"those fools!" the old man grumbled. "they misspelled my name!"
