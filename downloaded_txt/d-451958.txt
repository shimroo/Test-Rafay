fighting demons

by angela hill
this play was well received in our community and we have received nothing but positive comments. we took the play to our one act competition and received three first place rankings from the judges. this play allows each of the characters to be themselves and embody that character. this play does allow for a variety of ways to perform this play without black outs and losing the momentum one establishes in the telling of the story. a very moving production! twelve of the sixteen characters received outstanding performer awards at regional competition and off to state we go for even more awards!

laughing stock


michael stands alone on stage before an impatient audience, trying desperately to dramatize his lackluster existence. with the help of a madcap playwright, his life story is suddenly populated with exaggerated stock characters of every sort. one by one, the humdrum...




stalking the beatles


four friends are sure that the signs are favorable and they are destined to meet the beatles. after spending the night outside the hotel where the beatles are staying, they argue and encourage each other to believe that their dreams will come true.




who killed the tax man?


when the woodcutter and his wife accidentally poison the tax man who has come to their cottage to collect, the couple panics and leaves the body outside the doctor’s house. the doctor, thinking it is a patient who has died waiting for him, dumps the body in the garden...
