the political poem that was bullied out of me










the political poem that was bullied out of meby molly meachami had never been smalluntil i heard how evil i amfor being a teacher. with the lie levels
rising in newspapers, emails,interviews, announcements,the steady flood of anti-teacher propagandadissolves dignitypast patienceuntil i am in-visible andtaste ofsalt.me—the frightening muse of room 202is this incredibleshrinkingviolet.i’ve often told students to absorbenvironment and squeeze itinto writing, but i, hypocrite, cannotcheck my mail without earplugsand blinders now. there is always a topstory that burns my cheeks ashen,and i am scattered by breath.but there’s no headline for meor for colleagues who’ve sold houses,who’ve taken on loans and grey-streaked templesto brace for the fight.these headlines are about these politicians,their pockets, and their pride. articlesfull of double speak and forked tonguehissing. the mayor and the board deal studentsas playing cards in stacked decks.they know nothing of the kids themselves:her grammar jokes, his zombie impression. that he’s afraid his fatheris never getting out of jail and his mom has breast cancer.that she is the first in her family to go to collegeand got a full ride. that he came out of the closet, and his mother is prayingfor evil to cease its possession. that she reinvents the worldon the page and then stages it. these kids swirlin cutbacks, media overload, starved affections, and poetry.they swear and swagger and smile metal.the fact these kids are alive and breathing knowledgein deadly communities is more miraclethan lazarus rising. and they do—they baptizetheir papers in ink and wash drafts cleanwith red. they highlight, spotlight, moonwalk. i mean,they are teenagers…there are mad dashes throughthe halls, too many tardies and dress code violations.but they are green and sprouting: dandelionsand dahlias, ivy, wisteria, and willows.i am a simple gardener, tillingwith words, preparing the ground—loam, sand, silt, clay. the clay models itselfinto familiarity. into the expressionof understanding that’s unique to each child.the board wants me to see only numbers,to measure the kids with percentages,to see them as payment and value-added.but i am an english teacher.numbers have never been my thing.i see that their learning is the shape of a yellow rafton a green river. we are the river dwellers.there is no salt in our water.it feels wrong to hate politicians who have never met me,but they made us feel miniscule—buzzing wingedthings like gnats or mosquitoes—for being teachers.it makes me hunger for biblicalretribution. so i will be an insect…in a plague of cicadas. we will be dressed asa river of blood, a torrent of chant and noise.there is no poem for this fight, for watchingthe mild mannered lose their voicesfrom screaming chants, feet raw with marching.hands, callused for chalk, will be rubbed with new blistersfrom holding signs.if we are faceless, let us be the drought, the blight,the salt in this freshwater cityso our students will not be nameless, faceless scoresin a city that hunts them for statistics.we will be living the politics.not writing a poem.i invite you (and ask you) to stand with me,for them.

we are still in the french open, and i love anything french though it all started with proust:


and suddenly the memory revealed itself. the taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on sunday mornings at combray (because on those mornings i did not go out before mass), when i went to say good morning to her in her bedroom , my aunt léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of tea or tisane. the sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before i tasted it; perhaps because i had so often seen such things in the meantime, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the shapes of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness. but when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, taste and smell alone, more fragile but more enduring, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, remain poised a long time, like souls, remembering, waiting, hoping, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unflinchingly, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection.

and as soon as i had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-blossom which my aunt used to give me (although i did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like a stage set to attach itself to the little pavilion opening on to the garden which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated segment which until that moment had been all that i could see); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the square where i used to be sent before lunch, the streets along which i used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine. and as in the game wherein the japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little pieces of paper which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet, stretch and twist and take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, solid and recognizable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in m. swann's park, and the water-lilies on the vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of combray and its surroundings, taking shape and solidity, sprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea.

demeter to persephone by alicia suskin ostriker










i watched you walking up out of that hole

all day it had been raining
in that field in southern italy

rain beating down making puddles in the mud
hissing down on rocks from a sky enraged

i waited and was patient
finally you emerged and were immediately soaked

you stared at me without love in your large eyes
that were filled with black sex and white powder

but this is what i expected when i embraced you
your firm little breasts against my amplitude

get in the car i said
and then it was spring

reviews of paper covers rock 

“a dazzle and a delight, chella courington’s poetry will carry you through the brave discoveries of adolescent sex, then turn around and chill you with what she knows of being a grown woman, then turn again and fill you with compassion for human distress. travel with her on these journeys and you’ll be going with beauty all the way.”
alicia ostriker, author of the book of seventy



“crisp narrative lines filled with energy, indignation, and fierce beauty. the images can take your breath away, and the title poem is one i’ll never forget.”
dinty w. moore, author of between panic and desire & editor of brevity



“in paper covers rock, courington narrates familiar poetic scenarios— adolescent girls exploring their sexuality; a poet/teacher observing her students in a prison—but always with bright, surprising details: one girl doesn’t just kiss the other, she ‘uncloses my eyes with her tongue,’ and a confident, authoritative tone that brings readers back ‘to the point of mooring.’ in this collection, loss is described with ‘words / like sour tree roots’ and trouble becomes so appealing, one can’t help but wonder ‘if satan’s the hero’ in her story.”
sara tracey, author of flood year


“chella courington’s voice of quiet reflection leads us through sensual memories of youth, struggles for affirmation and the middle-aged acknowledgment of frailty. these poems together form a tight weave of body-knowledge, experienced through time and the pull of first relationships.”

tom waits on being called a poet







inebreational travelogue: tom waits on being called a poet
by harriet staff
nancy smith wrote a review at the rumpus that celebrates tom waits and the book tom waits on tom waits. in said book waits weighs in on the many things he’s been called over the years, namely “poet.”

see:


it’s almost impossible to write an apt description of waits, but every journalist in this collection makes a worthy attempt. some of my favorites: “a mumbling sot on stage.” “a collector and researcher of bawdy stories.” “a half-buzzed derelict with the voice of a bulldozer.” “a gruff-voiced romanticizer of the seamy side of urban life.” “a practitioner of the fine art of conversation” “a depression-era hobo ridin’ the rails toward some unforsaken land.” “the teacher we wished we had.” “the greatest entertainer on planet earth.”

however he is described, waits’s magnetic stage presence draws people to him. his live shows take on a theatrical quality, complete with spoken-word ramblings, chain-smoking, dramatic movements, and a lot of jokes. waits is often referred to as a poet, a term he was quick to toss off in the early days.

“poetry is a very dangerous word,” says waits, “it’s very misused. most people when they hear the word ‘poetry’ think of being chained to a desk, memorizing ‘ode on a grecian urn.’ when somebody says that they’re going to read me a poem, i can think of any number of things that i’d rather be doing. i don’t like the stigma that comes with being called a poet—so i call what i’m doing an improvisational adventure, or an inebriational travelogue, and all of a sudden it takes on a whole new form and meaning. if i’m tied down and have to call myself something, i prefer ‘storyteller.’”


then, a bit on his process:


for a long time, waits admits, he was in danger of being overtaken by the low life he wrote about. he drank too much. he made bad friends. “i wanted to experience what it was like to be on the road the way i imagined it would be for the old-timers that i loved, so i would stay in these down joints because i was absorbing all the atmosphere in those places; the ghosts in the room. you want to be where the stories grow, and you think if you live in those places they’ll come up through the sidewalks and out of the cracks in the wall—and they do. but you have to be very clear about who you are and who it is you’re projecting, and there was a time when i was very unclear about who i was and i became a caricature of myself.”

over time, waits’s persona becomes both clearer and even more difficult to define. it’s a strange contradiction. each of his albums are so profoundly different, it’s as if we learn about a new side of waits with every album. some of the most interesting interviews include insight into his creative process:

“the creative process is imagination, memories, nightmares, and dismantling certain aspects of this world and putting them back together in the dark. songs aren’t necessarily verbatim chronicles or necessarily journal entries, they’re like smoke, it’s like it’s made out of smoke.”
