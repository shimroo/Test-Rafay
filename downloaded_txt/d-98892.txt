this merchants and bankers listings website is now years old and is now dedicated to climate-change issues arising from anthropogenic global warming. meanwhile, some of its timeline material on economic history (for 1560-1930) is being moved to a newer website managed by ken cozens and dan byrnes, the merchant networks project. this website among other things has emphasised data on modern developments, mostly on modern/technical industry, computing, and for the future, but today's "climate change problems" - or rather, the apparently-dreaded spectre of anthropogenic global warming, will be confined to this website. the editor's view is that in the context of climate change, the views of merchants and bankers (and economists), the keepers of matters economic, are due for a considerable shake-up. if this website can encourage the shake-up, and help inform it reliably, well and good. this website was closed in may 2020 due to corona virus issues and was re-opened in october 2021 after a rethink. -ed 
you can find much greater detail
for the timeframes
1550-1700 at another website... the business of slavery... a website
book also designed to bring genealogical studies up-to-date from 1530
to the present-day... as well as questions of merchant lives and
activities ... click now to ... the
business of slavery (in english history). 

how this website arose... 
this website, produced by australian writer/historian dan
byrnes, is a no-frills, text-based website designed simply to
list historical and genealogical information on many notable
merchants and traders of what is termed, the western world. 
the information delivered here by website proposes a basis for
a
longitudinal study of related topics from the time of crusaders, to
the present. 
however, the merchants, bankers and traders treated here are
mostly from the english-speaking world, since i can read no other
language besides english. 
merchants are often seen by historians as humdrum, mundane
people,
but certainly, the more conspicuous entrepreneurs amongst them can
seem very entertaining. 
after years of reading on merchants, commercial histories, and
business styles as they change over the centuries, i would be moved
(personally, in 2001) to say that bill gates, co-founder of
microsoft, quite apart from questions surrounding his current wealth,
or his abilities as a computer programmer, is one of the most
remarkable merchants in human history - which is saying quite
something. 
bankers in whatever era are a different matter, and in fact,
the
earlier, western history of banking is much-annoyed by sets of views
(theological disapproval) on the taking of interest, regarded as
usury. bankers however have varied, and still vary,
in the
"creativity" of their outlook, which is a factor which will
be given attention in these webpages. 
but here, with merchants
and bankers,
questions of injustice, greed, or charity, or clarity of commercial
mind, will also be treated, as might be found entertaining.
(hyperlinks to relevant websites as given in the text will add to
this aspect of this website.) 
this website is not exactly a book
project; it is
more a set of
listings of names, connections, notes, citations, with some family history and
bibliographic material added where relevant. "can this website
help other researchers?" is perhaps, the question! this website for the netsarfer means, work-and-thinking.
 but it is especially hoped that this set of listings will be of
help
to family historians. 
information
in these files is organised in chronological order from early
crusader times to the present (and please use the table above for
navigation): 
much of the information presented in this website arose as
part of
research for the
blackheath connection, a formal treatment of the history of
convict transportation from england to north america and then to
australia, 1718-1810. 
this however is not the only reason for the treatment of
mariners.
sea captains often went on land to work and live as merchants. much
more is known about this sort of behaviour in the english and
american cases, than the spanish, portuguese, dutch or french cases. 
european exercises in colonisation used the services of
mariners,
of course. how often sea traders operated as "minor bankers"
for short-term deals remains unknown. associated with mariners of
course is the matter of marine insurance, a very important aspect of
finance-handling. 
some of the information presented on this website is, as it
were,
"offcut material" from other related projects, and may
sometimes seem unfocussed, but remaining of interest when seen in
terms of long timelines, long perspectives. by 2020 the editor has decided that anthropogenic global warming is actually happening, so the bias of this website will head this way.
