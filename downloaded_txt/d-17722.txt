our mission
rf safe—a movement that has been online at the forefront of protecting public health since the 1990s. for over two decades, we have been dedicated to safeguarding the well-being of future generations by addressing critical, nonpartisan issues that have been overlooked for too long.
our mission is backed by decades of advocacy and research into the health risks of electromagnetic radiation. today, the latest scientific studies confirm that the debate over cell phone radiation hazards is settled—it’s time for decisive action.
it’s not about gadgets—it’s about policy and public health
at rf safe, we’ve worked tirelessly to design products that help reduce personal exposure to emfs. but it’s critical to understand this: accessories are not the solution. they are a stopgap—a way to invoke the precautionary principle today while we fight for the systemic change that will protect everyone tomorrow.
when you purchase an rf safe accessory, you’re not just buying a product—you’re joining a movement. a movement that:

demands policy change: to repeal laws like section 704 and update fcc guidelines.
prioritizes research: to understand and address the true impacts of non-thermal rf radiation.
pushes for safer designs: to make safety the standard, not the exception.

we know firsthand how safer phone designs can be created—whether through innovations like the interferometric array antenna, which reshaped fcc isotropic rules, or through light based communications, which offer a vision of a safer 6g future. 
but here’s the reality: technology can be made safer, but it won’t happen without policy changes.

1. update fcc safety guidelines: embrace modern science
cell phone index   ||      compare sar levels
the federal communications commission (fcc) continues to rely on outdated safety guidelines that were established in the 1990s. these guidelines only consider the thermal effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (rf-emf)—the heating of tissue when exposed to radiation. however, recent peer-reviewed studies have conclusively demonstrated that non-thermal biological effects—such as dna damage, oxidative stress, and cellular dysfunction—pose significant health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations like children.
why this matters:

2021 court ruling: in a landmark lawsuit led by environmental health trust (eht) and robert f. kennedy jr., the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit ruled in august 2021 that the fcc failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its determination that its 1996 rf emission guidelines adequately protect against harmful effects of exposure to radiofrequency radiation unrelated to cancer. this court decision underscores that the current standards are outdated and do not reflect the current understanding of health risks from non-thermal exposure.
national toxicology program (ntp) findings: the ntp study, one of the largest and most comprehensive investigations into the health effects of rf-emf, found clear evidence linking rf radiation to cancer, including malignant brain tumors (gliomas) and heart tumors (schwannomas) in animal studies. this landmark research raised significant concerns about the long-term safety of wireless devices, especially for children and pregnant women.
vulnerable populations: children are more susceptible to rf-emf exposure because their skulls are thinner, allowing deeper penetration of radiation into the brain. furthermore, their developing tissues are more sensitive to environmental toxins, and their longer lifetime exposure to rf radiation compounds the risks. studies have shown that radiation penetrates deeper into children’s brains, and they absorb more radiation compared to adults.
non-thermal effects: numerous studies have shown that even low levels of rf radiation—below the thermal threshold—can lead to dna strand breaks, induce oxidative stress, and disrupt the body’s natural cellular repair mechanisms. these effects have been linked to conditions such as cancer, infertility, neurological disorders, and sleep disturbances. non-thermal effects are not currently accounted for in the fcc's safety guidelines, leaving the public unprotected from the real risks posed by long-term exposure.

we the people demand:
the fcc must immediately update its safety guidelines to reflect current scientific understanding. this means incorporating both thermal and non-thermal effects to adequately protect public health. by enforcing stricter safety standards, the fcc will compel manufacturers to develop safer technologies, which is critical for the health of future generations.


2. restart national toxicology program (ntp) cancer research
rats - there is a connection: ntp, ri, and human cancer morphology
the national toxicology program's (ntp) groundbreaking research on rf radiation was one of the most comprehensive efforts to date to understand the health impacts of long-term exposure to wireless technology. despite its importance, concerns have arisen about the continuation of this critical research.
why this matters:

national toxicology program and ramazzini institute findings: both found "clear evidence" of carcinogenic effects from radiofrequency radiation (rfr) in animal studies, with increased tumor incidence in the brain and heart. recent studies have linked these findings to human cancers through similar genetic mutations and tumor morphology.
the importance of ntp studies: the ntp studies represent some of the most thorough investigations into the potential health effects of rf-emf exposure, particularly its link to cancer. these studies included over 10 years of research and were designed to provide the kind of long-term data needed to inform global health and safety standards.
health policy impact: halting ntp research would mean losing the opportunity to further investigate and confirm the risks posed by rf radiation. this research is crucial for creating effective public health policies, updating safety regulations, and ensuring that future generations are not left unprotected from the potential harms of wireless technologies. ending such research after finding evidence of harm is akin to discovering smoking causes cancer and then stopping all further research, which would be irresponsible.
therapeutic potential: while rf-emf poses risks, there is also potential for therapeutic uses, such as cancer treatment. therabionic, a recent fda-approved treatment, uses specific rf frequencies to treat liver cancer without thermal effects, showcasing the dual nature of rf-emf. understanding how to minimize the risks while exploring these therapeutic applications is essential for future innovation in medicine.

we the people demand:
we call for the immediate continuation and support for the ntp’s research. without this critical work, we lack a full understanding of the health implications of rf-emf exposure, which is vital for crafting informed policy decisions. continued research will also pave the way for safer technological advancements that protect public health.


3. end fcc regulatory capture: prioritize public health over profits
advocating for comprehensive wireless radiation regulation 
for decades, regulatory capture has allowed industry interests to exercise undue influence over the fcc, resulting in policies that favor corporate profits over public safety. industry insiders within regulatory positions create conflicts of interest that prevent the fcc from acting in the best interest of public health. this has led to the unchecked proliferation of wireless technologies without adequate safety standards.
why this matters:

industry influence and conflicts of interest: tom wheeler, former head of the ctia, a major telecommunications lobbying group, was appointed as fcc chairman under the obama administration. wheeler’s history of advocating for the wireless industry’s interests raised serious concerns about the fcc’s ability to regulate the industry impartially. under his leadership, the fcc failed to update its radiofrequency exposure guidelines, which remain based on science from the 1990s.
public trust and safety: the fcc’s failure to act has eroded public trust in its ability to regulate the wireless industry effectively. allowing industry lobbyists to drive policy decisions results in weaker safety regulations that do not protect the public from rf-emf exposure. the 2021 court ruling highlighted the fcc's inadequacy in considering non-thermal biological effects of rf radiation.
unchecked technology proliferation: without stringent regulations, the rollout of new wireless technologies, including 5g and satellite-based internet networks, continues without sufficient safety testing. this leaves millions of americans, including children, exposed to higher levels of radiation from a growing number of devices, towers, and networks.

we the people demand:
the fcc must implement measures to eliminate industry influence and ensure that public health and safety are the primary considerations in all regulatory decisions. this includes enforcing transparent, science-based policymaking and ensuring that future fcc leadership has no ties to the industries they are tasked with regulating. only then can we rebuild public trust and protect future generations from unnecessary health risks.


4. amend the telecommunications act of 1996: restore local rights
the problem

the telecommunications act of 1996 restricts local governments from rejecting cell tower placements based on 
health concerns, effectively stripping communities of the power to protect their own environments. this 
federal overreach disregards mounting scientific evidence on non-thermal rf radiation effects and undermines 
local autonomy—leaving residents unable to voice legitimate safety and environmental objections.

key evidence

outdated standards: the fcc’s 1996 guidelines ignore decades of research pointing to non-thermal biological effects, especially those impacting vulnerable populations like children.
implied conflict preemption: under current federal law, local health-based regulations concerning tower placements can be overridden, limiting communities from enacting stricter safety measures.
tort immunity & regulatory capture: telecommunication industries benefit from legal shields and a history of undue influence over agencies like the fcc, impeding unbiased, science-based policy decisions.
suppression of science: halting critical research, such as the ntp studies, deprives policymakers and the public of the evidence needed to make informed decisions about rf-emf safety.

we the people demand

amend the telecommunications act of 1996 to restore local control over cell tower siting and empower communities 
to address health and environmental concerns. by granting local authorities the right to establish stricter, 
science-based guidelines and hold the telecommunications industry accountable, we can foster safer infrastructure 
that respects both public health and democratic principles.



5. force fda to follow public law 90-602 (1968)

the food and drug administration (fda) is legally mandated by public law 90-602 (passed in 1968) to
“plan, conduct, coordinate and/or support research, development, and operational activities to minimize the exposure of people to unnecessary electronic product radiation.”
this statute unmistakably includes modern wireless technologies—like cellphones, tablets, and other devices emitting radiofrequency (rf) radiation. despite the clear language of the law, the fda has not only failed to enforce safety standards updated with the latest scientific research, but has also effectively halted additional cancer-related research following the national toxicology program (ntp) findings of “clear evidence” of carcinogenic activity in rats. this dereliction of duty leaves americans exposed to rapidly expanding wireless technologies without the benefit of current, science-based oversight.

why this matters:

legal duty: unlike the fcc, whose authority stems from telecommunication policy, the fda has an explicit public health mandate to protect against “unnecessary electronic product radiation.” halting vital follow-up studies—after initial findings indicate possible cancer links—undermines that core mission.
1980s tobacco parallel: historically, once early data linked smoking to cancer, research and protective measures increased. the fda’s sudden cutoff of ntp’s rf studies is akin to discovering cigarettes cause lung cancer and then shutting down all further investigation—an irresponsible move that could leave long-term dangers unaddressed.
non-thermal research gap: mounting evidence from ntp, ramazzini institute, and other studies points to dna damage, oxidative stress, and other non-thermal effects at everyday exposure levels. if the fda won’t study these findings, no regulatory body will push for more stringent safety measures.
children & vulnerable populations: the fda’s silence especially threatens groups like pregnant women, infants, and individuals with chronic illnesses—populations more susceptible to even low-level rf radiation. failing to enforce or update federal guidelines means these groups remain at risk.

we the people demand:

the fda must fulfill its legal obligations under public law 90-602 without delay. we call for:


immediate resumption of ntp research: resume and expand the halted studies to confirm or refute the preliminary cancer links, ensuring policy decisions are based on the fullest possible scientific record.
transparent public updates: provide regular, easily accessible reports on ongoing findings regarding rf exposure, and communicate potential hazards and precautionary measures to the public—especially for children.
enforced accountability: collaborate with the fcc to align standards that encompass both thermal and non-thermal effects, reaffirming the fda’s leadership in health protection over corporate or industry pressures.


by compelling the fda to obey its own founding law and enforce updated, science-based rf radiation guidelines, we safeguard present and future generations. americans deserve regulatory action grounded in the best available data—not arbitrary defunding of crucial research after early warning signs.



take action now: your voice can make a difference
the urgency of these issues cannot be overstated. scientific evidence underscores the need for immediate action to protect our health and that of future generations. here's how you can help:

contact elected officials: reach out to your representatives at all levels of government. express your concerns and demand action on updating safety guidelines, continuing ntp research, and addressing regulatory capture.
spread awareness: share credible information about the risks of rf-emf exposure and the need for updated safety standards.
support legislation: advocate for laws that mandate lower radiation emissions, promote safer technology development, and enforce transparency and accountability within regulatory agencies.
practice safe technology use: reduce personal exposure by using wired connections, limiting cell phone use, and keeping devices away from your body. encourage others to do the same, especially for children's safety.



significant research indicates potential health risks
there is a significant body of research indicating potential health risks associated with cell phone-level electromagnetic radiation. this includes major studies like the interphone study, hardell group studies, cerenat study, u.s. national toxicology program (ntp), ramazzini institute study, reflex project, bioinitiative report, and the work of researchers like dr. henry lai. these studies collectively point towards an increased health risk from cell phone-level electromagnetic radiation and highlight the absurdity of dismissing potential risks.
it is becoming clear the misclassification of rfr risk is responsible for holding back life-saving medical interventions; a recent review stated:

“existing literature points toward a yet untapped therapeutic potential of rf-emf treatment which might aid in damaging cancer cells through bioelectrical and electromechanical molecular mechanisms while minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissue cells.”

this may be the most crucial issue of our modern era; advancements in rf radiation research show biological interactions beyond thermal effects. for example, the fda-approved therabionic treatment, which employs rf radiation at power levels up to 1,000 times lower than those emitted by cell phones, effectively treats inoperable liver cancer through non-thermal interactions at the cellular or molecular level. this includes resonance effects, disruption of cellular signaling, and potential modulation of the immune system. this proves the traditional view that non-ionizing cell phone radiation is biologically inert except for its heating properties is wrong.
therefore, the outdated fcc guidelines must be updated, and funding for the ntp cancer research must be continued to protect public health.
