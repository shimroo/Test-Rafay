i’m audrey woulard, and my portrait studio is called kids and the city (katc). thanks for stopping by! i’ve been a full-time professional photographer for over 20 years, and when i’m not behind the camera, i’m busy being a wife and mom to four incredible boys (who are my toughest critics!). based in chicago, i specialize in creating standout portraits for the high school senior who doesn’t want the cookie-cutter look, and families who want something a little more them and a little less posed.my images don’t look like anyone else’s, and that’s exactly why my clients hire me. whether you’re in chicago, naperville, plainfield, willowbrook, highland park, winnetka, northbrook—or somewhere in between—i’m all about delivering something different. and yes, i know photographers say that all the time, but let’s be real: if all your friends have the same portraits, do you really want yours to blend in?i tailor each session to you. from creatively showcasing your hobbies and sports to making sure your photos reflect your personality, i’ve got you covered. that’s why i get so many referrals—people love that their session isn’t a “copy-paste” version of someone else’s shoot. it’s your own look, your own vibe. oh, and did i mention? the light’s always working in your favor, too! because finding that special light is my speciality!
