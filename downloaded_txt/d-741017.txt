												major labels have used our 
												"demos" as radio singles. 



												as a nashville recording studio, our productions feature 
												exclusive major label players 
												you won't find available 
												anywhere else. our musicians 
												have played on grammy award 
												winning albums by artists such 
												as carrie underwood, garth 
												brooks, trisha yearwood, jason 
												aldean, and toured with 
												legendary artists such as hank 
												williams jr, loretta lynn, brad 
												paisley, and more!  our clients 
												range from today's hit-makers 
												(who've had their songs recorded 
												by morgan wallen, faith hill, 
												dixie chicks, eric church, and 
												countless others) to 
												first time writers who have used 
												our services to achieve major 
												cuts, placements, radio and tv 
												success including american idol 
												and the voice. 



												most of these writers live 
												nowhere near nashville and yet 
												have received more musical 
												success than 98% of nashville 
												songwriters. simply send our nashville recording studio a 
												rough worktape of your song (or 
												lyrics only) and get back a 
												radio-ready masterpiece!  you 
												will receive a free upgrade to 
												radio-ready mastering saving you 
												hundreds of dollars per song.




												let the music speak for itself.

														work?


it couldn't be more 
														easy! you simply 
														


email 
														the music producer, stacy 
														hogan, directly from 
														this website! let him 
														know what you're looking 
														to do. 





you can feel free 
														to send an mp3 or link 
														for him to hear your 
														song. he will directly 
														communicate with you his 
														thoughts and suggestions 
														to make it the most 
														pitch-ready production 
														possible.  he will also 
														give you the pricing and 
														payment link to get your 
														project started right

why choose 
														awritersparadise?


you only get one chance 
														to make that first 
														impression with your 
														song when 
														pitching....why not get 
														it right the first time. 
														

people can hear the difference.  
														last year, in broadjam's 
														"blind review" process 
														of over 300,000 songs, 
														their users picked their 
														top 10 "up and coming" 
														songs on earth.  8 
														of the top 10 were 
														produced by a writers 
														paradise. 
														
														a huge percentage of our recording studio 
														business is producing 
														songs that clients had 
														produced elsewhere 
														before they found us. 
														they had high hopes for 
														their song and got back 
														a production that 
														sounded ok, but not 
														great.  with 
														1,000's of songs out 
														there being submitted 
														every day to publishers, 
														contests, and artists.. 
														you want to stand out.  
														save money and get your 
														song done right the very 
														first time.  we've 
														taken countless songs 
														that writers said were 
														"sitting on the shelf" 
														and produced them for 
														today's radio market and 
														achevied amazing 
														success.
