who we are



we’re kevin and marcy vandyke, owners of anastasia fitness. it all started when tara vighetti asked kevin if he knew anyone that wanted to purchase the refinery athletic club(a temporary rebranding of the club). kevin took her up and purchased the club on september 1, 2014. that was the beginning of our stewardship of the club, but the origins date back to 1985 when tom wiley built anastasia athletic club, at the time a pre-eminent racquetball club. since 1985 anastasia athletic club until the name changed to anastasia fitness in 2014, has served st augustine and st augustine beach community with group fitness, personal training, cardio, strength, swimming, the amenities go on.
