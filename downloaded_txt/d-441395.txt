welcome to rob williams real estate
& harpswell property management

                    since 1979, our team at rob williams real estate has served the real estate needs of 
                    harpswell, maine and the surrounding coastal areas. we are the oldest established 
                    real estate office in harpswell. as recognized leaders in the local real estate market, 
                    our goal is to provide support to our clients throughout all aspects of the real

                    the coastal community of harpswell, maine is uniquely located adjacent to brunswick, 
                    maine (home of bowdoin college and the brunswick executive airport), 40 minutes from 
                    portland, and less than 3 hours from boston. harpswell consists of a mainland peninsula 
                    and three major islands connected by bridges, along with an additional 47 offshore 
                    islands. this results in harpswell having over 216 miles of water frontage, with more 
                    frontage than any other town in maine. harpswell properties are often available with 
                    water frontage, water views, and/or water rights. harpswell also enjoys some of the 
                    lowest taxes in the state. 
                

                    harpswell has a strong fishing heritage, coupled with its quiet, coastal village 
                    atmosphere. this provides the perfect retirement and vacation appeal for those who 
                    enjoy the rural maine coast. boating, kayaking and recreational fishing are attractive 
                    options for area visitors. there are also many fine anchorages still available here 
                    in harpswell.
