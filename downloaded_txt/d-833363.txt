   welcome to the denver r/c eagles flying clubthe denver r/c eagles was founded in 1960. since its inception, the club has grown from a small group of rc enthusiasts to a group of over 100 members. our club is chartered by the 
academy of model aeronautics, a national organization dedicated to r/c flight.the eagles flying site (suhaka field) is located at cherry creek state park, approximately 9 miles southeast downtown denver. there are two paved runways (450' & 275'), paved taxiways, and a pit area. we also have a separate flying field dedicated to rotorcraft. the elevation at suhaka field is 5,700 feet.our club activities cover nearly every phase of r/c aircraft building, flying, and fun-fly events. club members have diverse interests in scale war birds, aerobatics, helicopters, ducted fan jets, electrics, and turbine powered aircraft. beginners are always welcome. and instructor pilots are available for flight training.the runway facility was built, and has been maintained by the membership of the denver r/c eagles club, at a cost of over $90,000. your membership is encouraged to help support these facilities. 
a colorado state park pass 
is required for access to suhaka field. the state park annual pass is the most cost effective way to gain regular access.the denver r/c eagles is a 501 c (3) organization, all donations are tax deductible.
