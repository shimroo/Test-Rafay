how to check in





                  whether you check in on delta.com, the fly delta app or in-person at the airport, youâll be expected to present government-issued photo identification along with your boarding pass. international travelers also need additional documentation, which can be fulfilled with delta flyreadysm. if you need help while checking in, weâre here to assist.

airport curbside
if youâd prefer to check in as soon as you exit the car, find a delta curbside desk located at passenger drop-off at most u.s. airports. here, you can check your baggage directly after youâve exited your vehicle. if youâre bringing oversized baggage, you may have to bring it inside to an oversized baggage area. there is no fee for using curbside check-in at the airport, but gratuities are always appreciated for outstanding service.
