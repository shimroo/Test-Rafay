personal loan rate & terms disclosure
personal loan rate examples (for illustrative purposes only): a $10,000 loan at 8.49% apr with a term of 3 years would result in 36 monthly payments of $315.63 (total repayable : $11,362.68) and a $10,000 loan at 11.43% apr with a term of 5 years would result in 60 monthly payments of $219.57 (total repayable : $13,174.20).
each state has specific rules and regulations that govern lending partners. the amount you can borrow, the apr, and repayment term are based on your state’s laws, the lending partner, and your creditworthiness.
the operator of this website is not a lender and does not make loans or credit decisions. this website will submit the information you provide to lending partners, who will first use a soft credit check(s) to assess your eligibility for a loan. there is no guarantee you will be presented with any personalized loan offers, or that upon presentation of any personalized loan offers you will qualify for the rates, fees, or terms shown on this site. providing your information on this website does not guarantee that you will be approved for a loan.
if you receive a loan offer, it is imperative that you review the lending partners terms and conditions before proceeding with an application for a loan and please note, that at the point of application with the lending partner you may be subject to a full credit check.
†accept your loan offer and your funds will be sent to your bank or designated account within one (1) business day of clearing necessary verifications. availability of the funds is dependent on how quickly your bank processes the transaction. from the time of approval, funds sent directly to you should be available within one (1) business day. funds sent directly to pay off your creditors may take up to 2 weeks to clear, depending on the creditor.
†number of documented secured, unsecured, and prepaid credit card approvals on creditsoup.com from january 1, 2017 to september 24, 2024.
