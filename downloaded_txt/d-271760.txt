powering a culture of philanthropy







tbf's 2024 annual report is built around the remarkable and moving stories about our community of donors and the inventive and very personal ways in which they partner with the
nonprofit organizations and causes they support. to complement that work, we're also pleased to highlight a new video series that captures our partnerships with nonprofit leaders and organizations across our pathways to equity, and the collaborative work at the heart of creating a stronger, more equitable boston.

our approach to equity
we acknowledge and recognize that we do not all start from the same place. equity focuses on systemic, systems-level change that works to adjust imbalances and repair historical harms. together we can improve lives, strengthen communities and build a better—and more equal—boston.

our work
we believe that closing the gap on the region’s greatest disparities opens pathways to opportunity, prosperity and equitable outcomes. this complex, challenging and critical goal requires tackling the individual-, systems- and root-level causes of inequity. here's where we are digging in.
what we do



 



 


you by our side. equity at the center.
the systemic and structural inequities at the core of our region’s disparities cannot be dismantled without extraordinary perseverance and collaboration among visionary and courageous partners, donors and leaders. together we can improve lives and strengthen communities.
