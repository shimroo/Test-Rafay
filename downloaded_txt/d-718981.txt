aboutshelly fairchild, a singer-songwriter and a billboard hot country singles charting recording artist, is one of the pioneers and trailblazers for the lgbtqia+ community in the nashville music scene.



after music row made it clear that “queer” was not welcome during her time on a major label, fairchild dug her heels in and not only made a name for herself but has consistently created safe and inclusive spaces in music city for artists of the queer and the queer affirming community.born in mississippi, her musical upbringing brought her to nashville, tennessee, where she started writing and recording at 19 years old. she has toured with martina mcbride, keith urban, tim mcgraw, and many more. shelly has been featured as a background vocalist with jason aldean, eric church, tanya tucker, the randy rogers band, trace adkins, terri clark, lennon stella, martina mcbride and others. as a songwriter, shelly has had over 100 television placements as well as having her songs recorded by multiple artists including little big town, tanya tucker, ty herndon to name a few. shelly is a regular guest on the grand ole opry and in 2022, she joined the kill rock stars family and will be releasing her fifth studio album on her new label home.shelly fairchild saunters confidently and firmly across genres, with original music in station 19, selling sunset, riverdale, the hills, love island, american ninja warrior, grey’s anatomy and a long list of other media with varying tones and genres. with “faithful to freedom”, shelly steps back into the realm she feels most at home in – alt country infused with a little bit of the blues.
