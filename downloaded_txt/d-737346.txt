  happy thanksgiving from vfn! we're so grateful for vermont's vibrant local food system, and all the amazing farmers, producers, and chefs who raise the food we eat, and bring it to our table. we hope your day is full of delicious, local food! 🦃
#vfneats #vfndrinks #vfnmember #thanksgiving2024 #eatlocal #localfoodvermont #vermontagriculture #vtagriculture #vermonthanksgiving #gobblegobble





    

  looking to spice up this year’s thanksgiving dinner? check out @trenchersfarmhousevt’s recipe for focaccia stuffing at trenchersfarmhouse.com. and if you still need to stock up on some ingredients for your thanksgiving table, check out the diginvt blog at the link in our bio for a list of farmers markets around the state that are open this weekend! 🦃 

posted @withregram • @trenchersfarmhousevt while we originally wrote this recipe for thanksgiving, this stuffing is good all year round. snag a loaf of our limited edition italian herb focaccia and get the recipe at the link in our bio!
.
you can also eat this stuffing on its own for breakfast. add a fried egg or even cut a slice and sear it “savory french toast” style! 
.
in the spring we substitute the herbs for oregano & dill and the veggies for peas and add a little extra lemon zest and sometimes some feta too. in the summer we replace the herbs with zhug spice and veggies for carrots and add 2 tbsp of harissa paste to the broth! it is such a versatile stuffing recipe, have fun with it!

  today we want to give a spotlight to one of vfn’s newest member additions: @vontrappfarmstead! von trapp farmstead is a third generation family farm located in waitsfield, vermont. on their farm, they make award winning cheese, organic yogurt, and pasteurized meat from their regeneratively raised cows and pigs.

in 2020, they opened their farm store where they sell all of their own products (artisan cheese, yogurt, and meat) and veggies, beverages, prepared foods, beer & wine, and more from over 40 vermont based businesses. in addition, they have decided this summer to open up the farmstead to the public through guided tours of the farm.

on these tours, participants will learn about the history of the farm, the farming and grazing practices, and the cheesemaking process. participants will also get to visit the pasture, tour the barn, meet some herd, and take a peek at the creamery. these tours are suited for all ages and you can sign up in advance on their website at https://buff.ly/3wfypsx . join them this friday or saturday (august 9-10) for a tour during vermont open farm week!

von trapp farmstead joined vfn because they recognize the importance of local partnerships in vermont’s food systems. as von trapp farmstead team member rachel wylie put it, “as farmstead cheesemakers, we spend most of our time milking cows, haying, and making/tending to cheese! it’s easy to keep our heads down and work our craft… it’s the moments when we look up and get out to connect with our local partners that we feel most inspired and proud to be part of our local food system!”

welcome to the network, von trapp farmstead!

  we're saddened to hear that longtime vermont fresh network member bill mares has passed away. anyone who knew bill knows how dedicated he was to his community, and how generous he was with his time, expertise, and resources. we were fortunate to work with him for many years through his leadership at the vermont beekeepers association, and through his beekeeping ventures, mares apiaries and btv honey. bill and his bees have been a fixture at the annual forum dinner for years.

all are welcome to a celebration of bill's life at st. andrews episcopal church in colchester on saturday, august 10 at 10:00am. there will also be a gathering of friends and relatives to tell stories and have a good time in his memory in september.





    

  congratulations to all of the vermont fresh network members who won a seven daysies award!🥳 🥂





    

  have you heard? the team at @saltandbubbleswine have officially announced the opening of their new cafe @leoandcovt! leo & co will be located on essex way, taking the place of the former sweet clover cafe. kayla silver, owner of salt & bubbles and leo & co, explained her inspiration for leo & co, “without sweet clover market, there was nowhere to locally purchase local meats, veggies, breads, and other artisanal local products all in one place.” being a long time member of vfn, kayla understands the importance of providing communities with locally sourced food, and she plans to do exactly that with leo and co. as she put it, “local partnerships are everything! they are everything! they are relationships, they are community development, they are what tie us together and make us stronger…plus everything’s much tastier that way!”

kayla named the cafe after her great uncle leo who was a survivor of the holocaust and a fine foods merchant. she describes him, “leo was a lover of enjoying life, travel, treating yourself, good food, good music, good company, and he was always the first person to welcome you in, to start the party, and to create community within seconds.”

join leo & co. for their grand opening this weekend! and thank you to kayla and your team for your commitment to your local partners and strengthening vermont’s food system!

  the annual forum dinner offers the opportunity to sip and taste your way through the best of vermont’s local food - and vote for your favorite! each year, we celebrate the winners of the evening’s “best bite” and “best sip” with prizes generously donated from members of our community.

last year, chef bill and his culinary team at @wakerobincommunity took home the best bite award donated by @narin_m_knives, for their shishito pepper stuffed with smoked tamari mushrooms and garnished with pickled radishes and habanero lemongrass honey.

@simonpearce provided the best sip prize, which went to mimi at @madriverdistillers for her blueberry mojito.

@narin_m_knives is once again offering a beautiful handcrafted chef knife for the best bite winner, and the best sip winner will receive a wine crock and set of cocktail glasses from @farmhousepottery. we can’t wait to see who will take home these great gifts this year!

  as vermont faces historic flooding for the second year in a row, we’re thinking of our communities around the state who are facing challenges and dealing with the fallout of july 10-11’s flash floods.

we don’t know yet how many of our members have been affected by these floods, or how bad the damage will be as water levels continue to rise in some areas, but if you and/or your business have been affected, please know that the vfn’s thoughts are with you and we are here to offer any help we can. if you need volunteer assistance with physical clean-up efforts, repairs, or other tasks please let us know.

we’ve assembled a list of resources on the vfn blog that we’ll continue to update in the coming days. our thoughts are with our members and communities across the state today.

  now announcing vermont fresh network 2024 gold barn honorees!

to receive the gold barn distinction, members must spend at least 35% of their annual food purchasing budget on local food and products. they also must have at least 10 local producer partners, which could include vegetable farmers, beekeepers, maple sugarmakers, meat producers, dairy farmers, cheesemakers, brewers, cidermakers, tree fruit growers, or other specialty food and beverage producers.

by prioritizing strong partnerships within vermont’s vast network of independent growers, farmers, and producers, gold barn member restaurants are strengthening vermont’s food system, supporting rural communities and economies, and engaging in vermont’s agricultural industry and working landscape.

vfn currently has 57 gold barn members, and collectively they spent more than $13,000,000 on local food and beverage products in the past year! that’s $13 million directly supporting independent farms and locally-owned businesses.

join us in celebrating our gold barn members this month! 🙌

  vermont’s going to see lots of snow this weekend! and while that’s great news for sugar on snow lovers, it may impact your maple open house weekend plans. most @maplesyrupvermont participating sugarhouses are planning to offer their activities as planned, but some are postponing or rescheduling due to the anticipated storm. here are a few tips for navigating your travels this weekend:

❄️ please check local weather listings as you head out to see if snow or ice may be part of your travel.

🚗  visit newengland511.org for the most up to date road conditions.

📞  call ahead! some locations will be open all weekend, some may be open on sunday only.

☀️ travel on sunday! many locations are moving events to sunday and the weather looks great.

🍁 for the most up to date information, check with your local sugarmaker or visit the vermont maple sugarmakers association website at @maplesyrupvermont 

have a safe, warm, and sweet weekend out there!

#vfneats #vfndrinks #eatlocal #mapleopenhouseweekend #mohw2024 #vermontmaple #diginvt





    

  it’s the season of warmer days, cooler nights, muddy roads, and flowing maple! vermont goes mad for maple every march during sugaring season, and there are lots of opportunities to celebrate vermont’s liquid gold this year. sample vermont’s favorite sweet treats at sugarhouses around the state opening their doors for @maplesyrupvermont’s maple open house weekend, and continue celebrating maple at vermont restaurants who celebrate this favorite local ingredient in the food and drinks they serve.

this maple open house weekend (march 23-24, 2024), find the following maple items on the menu!

🍁 @flatbreadbtv | burlington - vermont sausage bread, made with house maple-fennel pork sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, mushrooms, mozzarella, grana padano, and fresh herbs. the maple in their sausage comes from happy hollow sugarworks in huntington!

🍁 @thebench_vt | stowe, vt - look for not one, but four maple cocktails to celebrate vermont’s liquid gold this spring. wind down after a day of exploring vermont’s sugarhouses with one (or two 😉) of the maple drinks on their menu!

🍁 @windjammervt | south burlington - celebrate maple and the spirit of collaboration in vermont’s food system with a maple manhattan from windjammer restaurant, crafted with saxton river distillery’s sapling maple liqueur.

these restaurants are members of vermont fresh network, and will be donating $1 from the sale of each maple menu item this weekend to support vfn’s work building partnerships and strengthening vermont’s local food system. we appreciate their dedication to working with vermont-grown ingredients, celebrating vermont maple, and supporting vfn’s mission.

  @foambrewers has become one of vermont's favorite breweries since they opened their doors on burlington's lake street in 2016. since then, they've expanded to offer a full-service restaurant called @deepcityvt, and they work with a variety of local farm partners to not only source food for the restaurant, but also source hops and grain for the beers brewed at foam. vfn's executive director tara pereira talks with bob grim of foam brewers, zach toensing of deep city, and kevin broderick of whitefield hop yard about the relationships their businesses have, and how they've built a sustainable cycle from the farm, to the glass, to the table. 

(note: shortly after this episode was recorded, deep city announced that they'll be closing indefinitely for normal service, due to a variety of challenges facing the restaurant and hospitality industry. foam brewers remains open and thriving, and they continue to have a strong relationship with whitefield hop yard. we look forward to deep city's reopening in the future!)
