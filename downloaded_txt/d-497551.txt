	 windy... windy... windy!
	 
    

today is starting out with quite a wind.driving to work i was barely able to maintain 10 mph over the speed limit! how can i get to work on time without being able to do my normal speed?! sheesh...yes we can tell the autumn winds are coming, the seasons are changing and dare i say... the "w" word... is coming sooner than we'd like. personally i'd like it if it never came. but for that to happen we'd have to move. face it, in the midwest we are stuck with... winter. today is sept 22nd... do you realize, i'll be the first to say it... only 3 months (93 days) until christmas! yikes!! how did that happen? but there is alot to look forward to during those 3 months too.. so let's not rush it. for now, i just need to figure out how much earlier i have to leave for work to be able to 'deal with' the wind. happy friday and have a great weekend!

	 it's all in perspective...
	 
    

i am thankful to say that i have a stomach virus this weekend. sounds hardly something you would expect someone to say... but let's put it in perspective.friday morning (very early) i woke up feeling very queasy. ok, i thought i was gonna heave. so i went back to bed in hopes i'd feel better later.. well, i woke at 7:30 and felt somewhat better, but slow and sluggish... by 10am i managed to get dressed and drive to my office to attempt transferring a few files. that lasted all of 2 hours.  i had severe cramps in the upper portion of my stomach. so i went off to rest.later i got a phone call from a friend, concerned about my stomach condition due to the news she heard on the tv. seems they were recalling all the spinach on the market... due to the  outbreak of the e.coli virus. this scared me because i had indeed eaten spinach on thursday for lunch. so, to make sure of what my particular ailment was... i called around and it was suggested i go to the e.r. and let them test me. i did.we spent2 hours in the e.r. friday nite, had blood taken and other body fluids and waited for the tests to come back, which they finally did, showing i had a stomach virus. (but thankfully not e.coli)so you see, it's all in your perspective.  we tend to forget from time to time... that no matter what is happening to us... it could be worse.  someone has it worse. somewhere.thank you lord, for keeping me well.

	 when you have one job... do it right
	 
    

i wore a 'safari necklace' to work today. it's made of wooden beads and wooden animals. (giraffe, tiger, elephant, lion, etc) it's very pretty and i get lots of compliments on it. there's one part i don't like about this necklace, and that is the back of it; the part that lays on the back of my neck. it's made of alternating wooden beads & discs all the way around. this results in the wooden discs either hurting my neck, or catching my hair in them, or both. usually both.i was showing it to a co-worker, and remarked about the disadvantage of it, and she had this to say,"you know, they have one job, it's to make a necklace. you'd think they could do it right and think about the person wearing it and design it for comfort as well as appearance. one job! that's all they had to do. why couldn't they do it right?"she said it all.... i rest my case.

	 death wish or just inconsiderate?
	 
    

i was on the all-too-familiar 4-lane interstate today,(2 lanes each way) and as i approached one particular hill where most drivers pulled into the left lane to allow trucks entering the highway room to get up to speed. it also allows for other trucks (already on the highway) to gather a little speed in order to make it up the hill. there was a small economy car a couple cars ahead of me in the left lane also, not going quite as fast as the rest of us and a semi in the right lane. now, granted the cars in the left lane were creeping up behind this small econo car, wishing it would move, but anyone with any common sense should know that you don't change lanes and get in front of a semi when it's trying to make it's way up a hill. yet that is exactly what this driver did, pulled 'directly' in front of the semi, causing him to apply the brakes. maybe that should be a question added to the driver's license test...it makes you ask the question:  do they have a death wish, are they just plain inconsiderate... or stupid?

	 toilet paper holders - must have been installed by men!
	 
    

women would notice this more than men.... but maybe there are some men out there that would even speak up. have you ever noticed how low on the wall the toilet paper holders are installed in public restrooms? i have noticed this over and over again. i find myself saying, outloud, "who installed this thing anyway...?  some man, no doubt." using no rational for the height they choose, i find my knees constantly banging into these things as i sit down. do they ever test the height at which they choose before installing? infact, i wouldnt be surprised if they installed them before installing the toilets.  i'd like to see a man sit on every toilet where he installs the paper holder, and attempt to get some paper out of it. maybe then he would learn where to install it! ...even a child would have trouble getting paper out of one, without falling off the stool!  come on.... builders, construction bosses, someone... can't we have some realistic guidelines????  sit on the stool and install the device so the paper will be dispensed above your knees!!!

	 weekly rejuvination
	 
    

ahhh the weekend... i love those weekends. they should call them rejuvination days, but we need more of them... 3 would be good.  friday was fun, the hubster & i went to a great little place in peoria called  red zin restaurant - they have good food, and a great piano bar you can request songs, sit and listen or sing along. quite a friendly bunch. afterward we headed for coldstone creamery ... mmmm, my friday nite treat!  saturday was a slow lazy day, i didn't even work for a change.  what a change! it was nice for once. flat top grill for lunch out at grand prairie mall, hadn't been there in a while, then walked it off strolling in and out of stores ending with a wonderful massage at my favorite chair... in sharper image.  i'll get that chair one day. dinner was enjoyable at jalepeno's - a fairly new mexican restaurant with great food, fun atmosphere, and a friendly staff. what a combination! sunday i went to see pirates of the carribean 2 - great film! go see it. i ended the weekend watching "mirror has two faces" with an allstar cast... what a wonderful end to the weekend... so, here we go ... another week, let's see what it holds.

	 don't use 1-800-flowers... ever!
	 
    

i don't normally speak poorly of a company on the first time they fail to come thru with what they advertise, but this is the 2nd time..."1-800-flowers" or online at  www.1800flowers.com ... for the 2nd time did not deliver the flowers i ordered.the first time was for a birthday, my daughter's birthday, and it was 3-4 years ago. i ordered those with plenty of notice... 3-4 days, and they never did show up! i swore then that i'd never use them again, and i waited a good long time before giving them a second chance.  this year... that 2nd chance came... and they flopped.on friday, may 12, i ordered flowers for my mom to be delivered to her at her office. she has room for them there and can enjoy them all week long... the website promised same day delivery if the order was placed before 2-pm in the time zone of the recipient. i made sure of making that deadline - i ordered at 9-am central, which was 7-am in her time zone...so they had 7 hours of advance notice!not only did the flowers not arrive on friday, but they called me later and asked for her home address so they could deliver them on saturday... i supplied them with not only her address but also her cell phone number to make arrangements in case they missed her again. did they arrive?... no did they call her?.... no.it's sunday now.... still no flowers.  i called them and asked what they intended on doing....yes, they did agree to issue a full refund, but that doesn't put flowers on my mother's table, now does it?
