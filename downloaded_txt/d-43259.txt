for 
		information on valuing your jewelry, click
		here.






please note: it is no longer 
		possible to respond to individual questions regarding jewelry history, 
		identification or value, or to offer written or verbal appraisals or 
		opinions. the demand for this kind of information is absolutely too 
		overwhelming for one dealer to fill. 
		i love jewelry, but appraising and selling are two 
		entirely different businesses, and i choose selling and research as my 
		business. 
		instead, i add articles on a regular basis to 
jewel chat on line magazine, a 
		wonderful reference for  information on many makers and styles of 
		vintage jewelry.
