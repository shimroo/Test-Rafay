basic poker strategyimproving the way you play poker is always important. this is why these strategies will help you improve the way you play. this poker strategy are mainly for the newcomer that hasnâ€™t had enough time to learn these through experience. this will help give your gameplay a boost, and get you on the fast track towards improving.
#1: avoid drinking too much
even if you are at home, playing online, it is always a golden rule to never drink too much alcohol when playing poker; even if it is free. alcohol has a certain tendency to make even the best poker player into a reckless amateur. it will un-inhibit the way you play, which may let you think that your hand is better than it really is, or will allow you to take unnecessary risks. most of the professional poker players make sure to not over drink, as they know keeping their mind free and focused is the way to win. you can always drink after taking everyoneâ€™s money.
#2: donâ€™t be stubborn, fold
if you have a good, or even ok hand at the start of the round, and decide to stay in even when your hand has clearly become useless, that is the quickest way to lose all your money. many players become stubborn after having placed a few bets, and decide to stay in regardless of how good or bad their hand is. it is never too late, simply fold your hand and you will undoubtedly have more chips than if you had stayed in.
#3: fold often to play better hands
some may think that if you fold often, and when you finally do play, the other players will know that you have a good hand. that is false, players that rely on what their opponents have will always lose, so you only need to focus on your hand; at least at the start of each round. playing a bad hand just because you think it will improve when you get the community cards is not a good strategy. it is much better for you to start strong from the start.
#4: keep bluffing to a minimum
bluffing is a great way to get some extra chips when you do it right, but there are times when it is best to not use such a risky strategy. bluffing should only be used when very confident, and very rarely. once a player has seen that you bluff often, you will never be able to bluff effectively again against that player. this is a secret weapon, emphasis on secret.
#5: money management and right choices
you always have to keep an eye out on your money, as it is your life line when playing poker; no more money, no more playing. this is why it is important to make the right choices before playing. pick the right table that has the right betting range that is appropriate for your bankroll. donâ€™t play at a $100/$200 table if all you have is $300. pick the right table, and watch as you climb your way up to that high roller table.
also, never play with money that you cannot afford to lose. donâ€™t play with money that is necessary for you or your familyâ€™s survival. it isnâ€™t good to play poker thinking you are going to lose, but donâ€™t make the mistake of thinking that you will always win.
#6: poker variants
donâ€™t get stuck playing just one type of poker. many believe that texas holdâ€™em is the only way to go when playing poker, but that is just because it is the most popular at the moment. there are many different poker variants that offer you the same level of competition, entertainment, and winnings. try playing omaha or 5-card stud. finding the type of poker game that you are good at will let you have fun while you win.
#7: control your emotions
there are two specific times when you should never play poker, when you are drunk and when you are emotional. by emotional i mean mad, sad, frustrated, or stressed out. your mind works very differently when it is affected by emotions, as it clouds your judgment, allowing you to take and make the wrong decisions. if you are unable to control your emotions, do not play. you are simply replacing rational thoughts with emotional responses.
#8: full attention
you must always be focused on the table and the players sitting at that table. you must be aware of the cards being played, as well as what your opponentâ€™s hands may be. this is important even when playing online, as it is easy to make mistakes when your attention is elsewhere. you may not be able to read your opponents as well while playing online, but you can always pick out small tells on the way they play after a couple rounds.
#9: donâ€™t constantly bully or call the last hand
if and when you have double as many chips as the other players, do not become that annoying player that bullies the rest into losing their ante at the start of each round by going all-in. that is the quickest way to become alienated and the game may even become boring to you after a while. i am not saying that you should never bully, just donâ€™t do it to often during regular games; using it during a tournament is actually a good strategy.
when a player has you beat, donâ€™t place the call bet in order to see their hand; it is not worth it. if you already know they will win, donâ€™t give them more of your chips, save them for revenge.
this general poker strategy will help you become a better player, or if you already have plenty of experience playing poker, this may refresh your memory on some of the basic things to do and not to do while you play poker.

for the terms that you do not know or understand, check out the poker glossary for the descriptions and explanations of the common terms used in poker.
before starting
before you even start getting cards handed to you, there are a few table rules that you need to look out for when sitting down. you will usually see a fraction, $4/$8 or $100/$200. these are so that you know what the small blind (sb) and big blind (bb) are. blinds are used instead of antes, a forced bet that the players have to place before receiving any cards, only two people will have to bet per round.
small blind only bets half of the ante, or minimum starting bet, and the big blind will place the full minimum bet.
first round betting
once the sb and bb have been placed, the dealer then hands out the cards. in texas holdâ€™em, you will only receive 2 cards to start off with, as the rest of the cards are community cards; they are cards that all players can use to make the 5-card combination. each player looks at the two cards that they were dealt, and from there the first round of betting starts.
players go around, starting from the person to the right of the bb and either check, fold, or raise. this goes around the table until it reaches the bb, where he can decide to raise, fold, or check. if someone raises, all players are then asked again if they want to call, raise, or fold. once everyone has placed the exact amount into the pot, the next round can start.
the flop
after the first round of betting, the dealer will then place three cards in the middle of the table. these three cards are called the flop. after the three cards have been placed, another round of betting occurs. depending on the two cards you have in front of you, you can decide to either raise, call, check, or fold. once the entire table has had their turn, the next round begins.
the turn
the dealer will now place one more card in the middle of the table, along with the three previously placed cards; this card is called the turn. now there are 4 community cards, and the two personal cards that each player has. another round of betting will start, along with the same choices as before.
the river
the last card is then dealt by the dealer, making a total of 5 community cards. the last card dealt is called the river. this will be the last round for betting. whichever players are still in the game at this point will take turns placing bets or checking. the last player to call on a bet will have to show their cards to the other players. if this player is the round winner, the other players can choose to show their cards or keep them hidden (it is a good strategy to keep them hidden regardless of whether you were bluffing or had a good hand).
obviously, the round winner will take what amount of chips that are in the pot. you are no longer able to play once you run out of chips.
poker can be said to be 50% luck and 50% skill, so donâ€™t forget to gain experience and skill as you play and learn.
