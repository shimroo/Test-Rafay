this tea and gift shop has been around for many years as a retail store, now he is only selling online. the quality of tea is fantastic, and there are so many great varieties at prices that are much lower than most any of his competitors.
he also has a lot of very nice accessories like teapots, cups, infusers and a whole bunch more.
he still has the shop location in mill valley, but it is no longer open to the public, it is just his warehouse and shipping location for the online sales. highly recommended if you like great teas, and if you call you can talk to the owner who is a wealth of information.

the quality of the teas he offers is unbelievable and the prices are much lower than any other place i have found with quality anywhere near to the same level!
he also has fabulous tisane selections!!
