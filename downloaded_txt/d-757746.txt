haunted attractions in pennsylvania 2025
with a history dating back to its founding in 1681, pennsylvania has its fair share of fascinating stories and legends that have long been shared around campfires. though many of these stories sound innocent enough, pennsylvanians know that there is a dark heart resting beneath its idyllic surface. instead of running as the halloween season nears and the ghouls descend on local towns and cities, the entire state celebrates with the most frightening haunted attractions imaginable. haunted houses, yard haunts, and zombie paintball bring some claustrophobic scares to the table with gruesome scenes and nightmarish situations that are straight out of iconic horror films. liberated from the confines of indoor locations, the state's haunted mazes, spook walks, and haunted hayrides give visitors the false hope that the light from the full moon will scare off any potential monsters. in actuality, these locations attract the evil and the macabre like moth to a flame. so whether you're looking to enjoy a mild jump scare or be dragged through a blood-chilling horror experience, hauntedpennsylvania.com is your one-stop resource for the state's best halloween entertainment.
