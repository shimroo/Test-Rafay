who we are



the laborers-employers cooperation and education trust (lecet) brings the
laborers’ international union of north america (liuna) and its signatory contractors
together to address issues of importance to both.








lecet works to identify new and emerging markets and position liuna and its signatory contractors to capitalize on those opportunities. it is one of the three funds that make up liuna’s tri-funds, organizations uniquely established to assist in expanding liuna’s market share. lecet, the liuna training and education fund (liuna training), and the laborers’ health and safety fund of north america (lhsfna) develop the marketing, training, and health and safety programs that give liuna a competitive edge.
lecet is governed by a board of labor and management trustees. lecet’s network consists of one national office and 38 affiliates throughout the united states and canada, all of which deliver services to liuna and signatory contractors at the national, regional, district council and local union levels.
