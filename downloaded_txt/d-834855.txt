keeping you always in our prayers!
mrs. r . shanthalakshmi, my mother and a retired teacher from chennai remembers you ever so gratefully, on the successful completion of 8 years post surgery. she is feeling very blessed to be living a pain free life. she wishes to thank you from the bottom of her heart for giving her a second chance in life. she is enjoying her every day and living a full life!





for a long time i have not been able to come to bombay & see you. everything here is fine & we are progressing well.
i hope you remember operating mr. madan gopal agarwal (age 70 years) for t.k.r. in both knees in the year 2000 in our hospital. that was the first operating of t.k.r. it is creditable that he has travelled thereafter at various places in india during last 12 years. he went to south india kanyakumari, andaman nicobar, darjeeling, badrinath, kedarnath, gomukh & also mansarovar. he also went on some tracking places. when he went to america he enjoyed all the adventures sports activities.
he just dies 3 days before at the age of 82 years. this is just for your information.
