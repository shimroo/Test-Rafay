we stopped by for a day in early may. probably one of the few cleanest and well maintained motels that we’ve stayed in on the west coast at the price offered so highly recommended. fully equipped amenities provided in the room and access to basic necessities within the facility such as coffee/ tea, ice, laundromat, etc provided also.

nice spacious room, well-maintained, nice walk-in shower with seat. great value for the money. ($79 for two queen beds the night we stayed.) clean and lovely grounds with beautiful plantings and public areas.

i will always stay here when i’m diving in ft bragg. they have an area to clean your wetsuits and your fish. very friendly owners and they do so much work to take care of the landscaping. very great price for a high quality hotel.
