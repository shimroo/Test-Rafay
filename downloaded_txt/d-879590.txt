9/11/2001 - remembering 22 years ago 











as we look back two decades ago, we can still remember where we were when we heard the news and when we saw those images across out tvs.  who could forget those who lost everything and all those first responders who gave at their own risk for the sake of others?  it is with this feeling we wish to encourage a month of giving.  two of our favorite charities are listed below.  we hope you’ll consider making a donation.  regardless of which charity you chose, let’s all consider being more giving and more acceptable of each other in such challenging times.   











tuesday’s children
helping survivors through grief and their struggles through mass violence and acts of terrorism. 







survivor’s network
the world trade center survivor’s network is staffed by volunteers, most of them survivors themselves.
