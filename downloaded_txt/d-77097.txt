which clean haircare products are right for you




thinking about switching your haircare routine to something a little cleaner, more earth-friendly, and full of naturally derived ingredients? joico’s inner joi line is set to become new best friend.




take this quiz and we’ll create an inner joi routine that’s custom-made for your hair:






when you’re frustrated with your hair, what are you most likely thinking? can’t believe my color is already fading! my hair never seems to grow long because it’s always breaking. no matter what i do, my hair is dry, dull, and…blah.which clean-beauty feature is most important to you? the ingredients are naturally derived. the products come in sustainable packaging. the line is animal test-free.how many times a week do you use a styling product? 1 x a week. 2 – 3 x a week. every single day.how often do you color your hair? every 4 – 6 weeks. every 7 – 10 weeks. never have.let’s talk hair texture. which is closest to yours? straight. wavy. curly or coily.how important is it that your hair products have an eco/social benefit – like giving back to communities in need, or cleaning up ocean plastic? super important. bringing positive change to the world is everything. it’s something i’m thinking about more often lately – like recycling. i don’t really look for that specifically, but it’s a nice feature.
