about us

about us
silver market publications was founded in 1993 by scott and june martin as a result of their evolving interest in and love of all things silver.  this progressed into multiple publications on silver, a series of silver/appraisal lectures, appraisal research assistance, silver sales and ultimately smpub.com.
the aim of smpub.com is to educate and cultivate a community of people truly interested in the beauty and history of silver. on this site, silver sales offers a variety of silver items for sale  and the silver library provides an index of silver references including the martinâs book of silver and guide to evaluating gold and silver objects.  also at the site are interviews with silver experts, collector presentations, helpful tools & tips.  the silver salon forums is the place  for interactive discussions about silver. the silver salon forums guidelines ensure a civil & respectful environment. we also donât discuss valuations because it is a distraction from our key mission.
please indulge, enjoy, engageâ¦the world of silver & explore our site.
