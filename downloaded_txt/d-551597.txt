learning through service to otherswhether it is through reading to kindergartners, creating artwork to save the rain forest, or helping our friends, every student experiences the inherent joy in giving.





honoring the path of each childevery child learns differently. as a montessori school, we create an optimal learning environment that respects each of our student's unique path and pace.





nature-based hands-on learningchildren thrive when left to explore in nature. as part of our curriculum, we regularly explore the 100 acre campus, our 1,500 sq. ft. tropical biodome, and more.
