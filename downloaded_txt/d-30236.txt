            you are at a site dedicated to the study and sharing of information about the stamps and postal history of hawaii in the years before it became a territory of the united states on june 14, 1900. stamps include postage stamps, revenue stamps, foreign office stamps, private issued stamps, postal cards and postal stationery. this category includes studies of counterfeit stamps. postal history is the study of stamps used on their original covers (envelopes or other mail pieces) to show the routes covers used to their destinations and the rates paid for the service. this category also includes the postmarks and service marks applied by post offices or by other people, such as forwarders or expresses, who handled mail.









              henry whitney, hawaii's first postmaster and the man who conceived and produced the famous missionary stamps 
              of hawaii, showed hawaii's place in the world on a map included in his 
              1890 guide to hawaii.  the hawaiian island chain stretches across the top of
              the north pacific along a nearly two thousand mile arc, but the eight inhabited islands depicted c.1890 in
              barnes' hawaiian geography are the hawaiian islands we connect with their
              stamps and postal history.
