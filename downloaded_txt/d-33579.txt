about us / bio 









 as a construct or entity, einstürzende neubauten is one of the few german bands that internationally sends out a genuine impulse via its unique trendsetting mix. it has affected numerous other bands and art genres – from dance theater to the visual arts; and has also inspired film up to the present-day – from schlingensief to tarantino.  







 
more











although the media mocked the band in the beginning as a bizarre “curiosity in the divided city,” it quickly established itself around the world as one of the renowned greats of the present and of pop culture. it has influenced an entire generation and even today it provides often copied blueprints for experimental sound art and performance.
