harold


order steven's book today! paperback available now


harold documents the meandering, surreal, often hilarious, and always thought-provoking stream-of-consciousness ruminations of the title character during a single day in class.
to quote one of its many memorable lines:
“everything doesn’t have to make sense. just look at the world and your life.”
