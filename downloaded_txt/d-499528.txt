about us

discript has been working with authors who are household names since 1989. we have been closely involved with other literary publishers, writers, translators and illustrators to produce books that are widely distributed and win prizes. it has been our pleasure to work with authors who have won the nobel prize for literature and the booker prize.

as a small independent publisher we started our own imprint with five titles in 2021, with more in the pipeline. we commission titles and originate our own material for publication. printed books are our products, with high production values, exciting covers and clear typographic design.

as independent publishers we take on books that corporate conglomerates would turn down: books by little-known authors or controversial subjects. we publish authors who have the talent to create books that otherwise might never be seen. we believe this will be more engaging for our readers.

david wurtzel, the chosen city







bobby steingrove is an outsider in his large, jewish family. his uncle stanley owns and runs a motion picture studio in hollywood during the golden era of the 1930s but bobby’s father alone amongst the steingrove brothers is dependent on stanley’s charity. when bobby gets into yale, though, a new world opens up to him. he falls in with a moneyed clique of amoral young east coast men. handsome and clever, bobby is able to keep up with them. he also falls in love and after an elegant party on fifth avenue he is willingly led into central park.

      ultimately his aspirations change, and he goes back to los angeles to work in his uncle’s studio whose biggest star, laura hampshire, insists that stanley films a new novel as a vehicle for her. what bobby knows is that the novel, which was written by one of his yale friends, includes a disguised version of himself as a protagonist. with mixed motives, bobby is propelled into writing the script and taking over as director, but when his past catches up with him, he discovers how far family loyalty goes. in a world where talent can be rewarded but acceptance and belonging are fluid, it is never clear who is being seduced or by whom.

author david wurtzel practised at the english bar and for several years was consultant editor of the bar’s magazine, counsel. his first novel, thomas lyster: a cambridge novel was published by brilliance books.

what does it really mean to be a carer? when your spouse, parent, sibling or friend is ill, disabled or vulnerable, they may need help all day, every day. will you give part of your time to be with them? how much will you sacrifice? your home, family, friends? your job, income, career? is your commitment open-ended? where do you draw the line? how much can you do for those you love?

in the uk an estimated 6.5 million adults are carers — 1 in 8 of the population. an estimated 13.6 million people are caring through the covid-19 pandemic. are carers 'volunteers', or do we rely on them? without 'informal' carers would social care and the nhs cope or collapse?

a paperback book by carers illustrated with their photos.
