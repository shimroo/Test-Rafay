editor's rating 


editorial reviewavis america was purchased by excel homes and was then sold under the excel homes brand which is now part of champion homes.  they were a good option offering custom designed modular homes that matched any site built home. their website was easy to navigate and has general information along with online floorplans of their standard homes which range up to 2500+ sq ft. we will miss avis america but are happy that excel homes is serving this area.  excel homes is a good option for modular home buyers looking for mid to upper scale homes.

personal reviews of avisamerica
rebekah evans from hardy county west virginiai am disappointed in my home i fell i have been ripped off.. i have had so many problems.. when my house came it was put together wrong and i complained and no one did a dam thing. .thinking about contactingbbb ...becky mayle from wvwe bought our home 2010. we fully customized our home and are super pleased with it.  for the most part everyone thinks that it was stick built. we are happy with it and would recommend a modular over a stick built due to the fact that you don't take the chance of your home being damaged by weather while you build.mark haffner from wantagh/n bellmorewe own one of the three homes built by avisand we love it. it is well made strong and just a beautifully designed home we are proud to own.5 starsrichard forrest from virginia beach, vai purchased my home in 2004.  my only trouble was that avis did not properly screen the "supposed" builder i contracted.  i later saw the resume they provided.  this "builder" had no previous experience and had no idea what he was doing.  it was a nightmare.  next time, i suggest you do a better job of screening.shirley miller from seaside park n.j.i purchased my home in 2004 i can tell you that after superstorm sandy living on an island with a lagoon in the back and the open bay in the front of my house taking a direct northeast hit my modular suffered not one bit of damage  as i look around and see the devastation i realize that we made the best decision of our lives i would never build a stick house on this or any high water area thank you thank you for a well built house i try to sell your avis modular to everyone that has to rebuild may even consider putting a model up on my empty lot by the ocean great companytom o'connor from chicopee,mass ( home was in hadley,mass.in 1986 we purchased a two story avis colonial @8'by 42' from mr.james dildyne and walter bilski of avis. they treated us right after we had a problem with purchasing a modular home from a supposeded dealer in chicopee,ma who later turned out to be only a hauler not a sales dealer for avis.we lived in our house for 20 years before we sold it. we were treated right by both mr.dildyne president of avis homes )  and mr.bilskichristian olsen from patterson nybought our cape cod though the home store. other than gc problems. the house is great. it really is energey effecient and built to last. avis really went out of there way to make sure i was happy.tom whoriskey from sagamore beach, mawe purchased our avis home from gbi builders in webster ma. in oct 2007, we occupied the home july 2008. no issues with gbi nor avis, only with the utility companies which delayed our occupation. the home is more than solid, no issues with home. we have been overwhelmed with praise from friends, family and neighbors and other guests about the look and style of the home.jeanne owens from deposit, ny 13754we bought our avis home through quality homes in afton ny in 2008.  we had a floor plan from a combination of 2 homes we had seen. this house is a cape still with and porch the full length of the house and a 12-12 pitch on the roof.  the house is 56' by 30'. we were so surprised to see that the upstairs was 56' by 15' so there is plenty of room for expansion.  we love our new home and we get complements on it about once a week.chris clifford from hagerstown, mdwe purchased an avisamerica home in 2005. it was quick, easy, and definitely affordable as compared to traditional built homes. we completely customized the floor plan, and were (and still are) exceptionally pleased with the home we purchased from avisamerica. people are always telling us how beautiful our home is, and they often find it hard to believe it's a modular!
