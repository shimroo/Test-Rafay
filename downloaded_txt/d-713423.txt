well, hey
 there!
welcome to my home
for those of you who do not
already know me, my name is allan purl. for those of you who do, well, sorry
about that.
about me
 
while you are here,
you my friend, are my honored guest
 
to view what you are about
to see,
is to embark on a journey
into into another dimension of time and space, a dimension known only as    
cyberspace.
to repeat a modern twist of
an old cliché, a journey of a thousand sites, begins with just a single click.
i have put together a
collection of various links and creations. some of which are my own, some of
which are not.
you will note that i have
not posted anything which is not mine within the content of my pages without the
author's permission, merely
links to the outside cyber world.
take a moment to look at my
motorcycling world. if you enjoy the outdoors, then you really should be on two wheels.
in my not so humble opinion, motorcycling is composed of most of the best things
in life.
check
it out.
 
on this next link, you will
find my personal photo gallery. some of the pictures will be better than others
my pix
 
due to the increases of
recent email messages being forwarded and passed around regarding various
warnings of all kinds, some of which are bogus, i have included a set of links that will allow you to
easily verify whether the message you have received is a hoax or real.
 
is it real or is it a
hoax?
take a look and see for
yourself.
 
and then there are other
items of interest.
it's definitely worth
taking a look at!
well, go on, it won't bite,
i promise.

questions,
comments, suggestions? let me know!
