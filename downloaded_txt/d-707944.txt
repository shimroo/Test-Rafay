	 large predatory cats in the eastern u.s.
	 
    


while reports of lions and other large cats in the eastern u.s. are often dismissed as escaped zoo or circus animals, some recent photographic evidence may prove otherwise. the above photo of a cougar was captured in columbia county, ny. the following picture shows a map of the recognized range of the cougar (mountain lion, panther, puma, etc.) as well as class 1(live sighting, photo or video) and class 2 (tracks, hair, etc.) evidence of cougars in other parts of the country.sightings of african lions have also been reported in the eastern u.s. more than one credible eyewitness has described large cats with manes and tufted tails, features associated with the male african lion. there once was a species of lion native to north america--panthera leo atrox--now said to be extinct. we may find that assumption to be in grave error . . .

wired had a cool slideshow of colossal  skyscrapers that have either never been built or may yet be built in the future.

	 water supply
	 
    


the sierras nevadas have been a primary feeding area for cattle in the past 100 years. consequently, much of the water supply--rivers, creeks, ponds--has been contaminated by bovine fecal matter. many of the animals that live in this area obtain their moisture from the plants they eat or from dew. recently, a bfro expedition to the sierras nevadas discovered what appeared to be another source of water--domes of snow covered by forest debris. all evidence points to deliberate construction by hand of these snow domes. now, of course, human construction is a possible explanation but what human would be making piles of snow in remote mountain forests in the middle of winter? the only other explanation is that these were made by sasquatch. it would be relevant to mention that howls and other sasquatch vocalizations were heard in the vicinity of the domes.

	 sasquatch--or something else?
	 
    


these photographs of an unidentifiable creature were captured on september 16 by a bushnell motion-activated camera. sasquatch, perhaps?

	 a victorian menace
	 
    


in october of 1837, a servant girl was walking home through london at night to visit her parents when she encountered a bizarre figure. he wore a long cloak, an egg-shaped helmet, and a tight fitting body suit of oilskin. the strange being grasped at her, ripping some of her clothes with his clawed hands. the girl's screams stopped the attacker, and drove him off into the night. and thus did springheel jack make his first appearance to the civilized city of london.the moniker 'springheel jack' came about because of this creature's ability to leap great distances in a single bound. he was also known to spray noxious gas at his victims from a glowing blue light on his chest. he terrorized london with his seemingly senseless attacks often bounding away while laughing maniacally. theories on springheel jack's origins vary from the mundane to the supernatural. whatever he was or is, he remains a mysterious entity who still imparts horror to the faint of heart.

	 thunderbirds, chicago 1977
	 
    


on july 25, 1977, in the field outside his family's home, ten-year-old marlon lowe was playing when two entities swooped down out of the sky towards the boy. marlon's mother, ruth, who had been inside the house, stepped onto the porch and saw a pair of enormous, coal-black birds flying over the field, one with her son in its talons. she screamed, and the bird dropped the boy, pecking at him as it flew off. six other people witnessed the event. ruth estimated the birds' winspans to be at least 18 feet. after doing a bit of research, she concluded that the birds reminded her most of condors.other citizens encountered either one or both birds in the lawndale, illinois area. after one sighting which caused a woman to collapse, a group of armed men went to the location of the sighting and reportedly killed a large bird. they burned the body, leaving no trace of evidence.the attempted abduction of marlon lowe by two gigantic birds is consistent with native american legends of thunderbirds.
