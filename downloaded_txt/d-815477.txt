“having had the privilege of working with all of australia’s elite musicians over such a long period of time i have no hesitation in saying that william barton is the only one who i consider to be a genuine musical genius.”

— martin buzacott, abc classical fm











william on composing

  


“my passion is to create a journey for people through music and present to them a diversity in musical styles with the didgeridoo and engage with audiences about the uniqueness of australia. it has been a specific passion of mine to work closely with classical music and composers to develop and sustain music for the didgeridoo in this environment.”
