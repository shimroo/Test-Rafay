there’s printing.and then there’s planet positive printing™, the most ambitious vision in the print industry.we’re net carbon neutral, we don’t use water, and we’ve sent nothing to landfill since 2009.


























we are incredibly proud to be the recipient of four queens awards for sustainable development, the most given to any company in the uk














our vision“business can and should be a force for good, it is our passion to create a business which is truly regenerative whilst producing our clients beautifully printed products.ours is a values-based business, versus a profit first one…we have been for over 25yrs and in that time we have achieved some fantastic milestones. from inventing a new printing process to proving zero waste to landfill was possible to creating our planet positive printing ambition…we have always challenged the accepted status quo and perceived limitations.  but despite all this, what excites me most is, where we are heading…we believe in doing what can be done today, not tomorrow…we believe that challenges and change are positive and most of all we believe we can create a business which is going beyond just carbon and climate change, to create truly planet positive printing. “- garethcall me! i would love to talk with you about your business and how our unique planet positive printing approach can support you – please do just give me a call 01865 770 140 or drop me a quick mail garethdinnage@seacourt.net

who we arewe’re a pioneering printing company that puts the planet first.oxford is our home. from there, we create net carbon negative prints of all shapes and sizes for our uk customers, including planet organic, wwf, and the national trust.we’re a b corp, which means we’ve been officially recognised for our environmental, social and governance credentials. not bad for a small-ish company in a traditionally wasteful and energy intensive and opaque industry.but we’re not stopping now. actually, for us, it’s full speed ahead. we’re working to go way beyond net-zero to become truly regenerative.
