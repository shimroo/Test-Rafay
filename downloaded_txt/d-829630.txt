i'm getting sick up & fed of this!!!

you won't see many posts from me here if i can't get this sorted out!the connection has timed out     the server at www.blogger.com is taking too long to respond.it normally takes me half a dozen tries to post something, so unless i can find a way to speed it up i'll be looking for another blogger site. maybe its popularity is slowing it down?

who'd a thunk it?

after the cyclone earlier this year that wiped out 95% of the banana plantations, bananas hit over $15 per kilo. they stopped offering banana smoothies in the mall and a few banana jokes made the rounds. but lo & behold here in the middle of winter we are eating bananas right off our little backyard banana tree. we've gotten two bunches off it, picked'em dark green and hung them up. only about 10cm (4inches) long but nice & sweet. i knew sydney was semi-tropical but i didn't expect this. ooops, the secrets out, now watch the visitors start rolling up!
