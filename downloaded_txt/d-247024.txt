official announcement about the situation in ukraine 





 




							official announcement						

as an interdisciplinary and inclusive organisation representing healthcare professionals from across europe, the european pressure ulcer advisory panel (epuap) stands with all of our ukrainian colleagues, friends and healthcare professionals who are working tirelessly in the face of immense adversity in ukraine. epuap remains in full solidarity with ukraine and stands united behind the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. we stand with ukraine and its people and will continue to support them. we must also be mindful of the impact on the russian people, many of whom oppose this conflict. we are a diverse and tolerant organization that embraces people from all over the globe to support education, research and improvements in patient care. this has served us well and will continue to do so in the difficult days, weeks and months ahead. epuap is supporting all clinicians who are caring for patients and supporting peace.
