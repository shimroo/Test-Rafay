				speed limit withdrawn
			

				the federal government has withdrawn its proposed 10-knot vessel speed rule for boats 35 feet and larger along the east coast. the announcement was published today in the federal register."this is great news for the marine industry," said viking yacht company president and ceo pat healey. "we will continue to push noaa to have the current 10-knot limit for boats 65 feet (loa) and larger amended so that technology-based solutions can replace these speed limits, which have been in place since 2008 but largely unknown to recreational boaters and minimally enforced until 2022.â



















				speed limit alert
			

				as viking seeks alternatives to the governmentâs proposed expansion of east coast speed limits to protect the north atlantic right whale, hereâs a reminder of the existing 10-knot slow zones for vessels 65â (loa) and larger that start in november.âthese noaa restrictions have been in place since 2008, and many boat owners have been unaware of them,â says john depersenaire, vikingâs director of government relations and sustainability. âthis is part of our effort to raise awareness to increase safety for both mariners and the endangered right whale.âa 10-knot limit is in effect from nov. 1 to april 30 in six seasonal management ...

				the mountaintop
			

				the viking yacht company has been building a better boat every day for 60 years. incredible! founded by brothers bill and bob healey on april 1, 1964, viking climbed the marine industry mountain and has been at its peak for decades now, unwilling to relinquish the throne as the industryâs best boatbuilder. 
			


















				we are family
			

				viking has been owned and operated by the healey family continuously for 60 years, which has been critical to the companyâs success. viking itself is more like a family than a business. every healey, bill, bob sr., pat, bob jr. and the third generation â sean, justin and kaitlyn â realizes that the lifeblood of viking is its people. 
			


















				evolution of excellence 
			

				building a better boat every day has resulted in dozens of milestone models. from 37-foot wooden cruising and fishing boats to the ground-breaking 55 convertible to the 38-knot resin-infused 90 sky bridge, viking has become the world leader in semi-custom fiberglass yacht production. 
			


















				people power
			

				the people of the viking yacht company are its heart and soul. weâve been blessed to have many great people as part of our family over 60 years. thank you to the best boatbuilders in the world. made in america and proud of it! 
			


















				manufacturing and technology
			

				our plants in new gretna and mullica represent the pinnacle of boat manufacturing achievement, with a combined 1 million square feet of space. always investing in the future, weâre dedicated to incorporating innovative technologies such as 3d printing into our boatbuilding processes and utilizing efficient manufacturing solutions such as solar power and tri-generation power production.  
			


















				demo program
			

				viking leads the industry yesterday, today and tomorrow. our demonstrator boat program plays a crucial role is a big reason for that. it affects how we design, engineer and build vikings, and allows us to refine and improve the boats by using them in their intended environment. started by pat healey, the programâs longevity and success are unrivaled in the marine industry, illustrating our passion for the boating and fishing lifestyle and strong connection to viking owners.
