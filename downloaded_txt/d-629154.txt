where larger firms may treat you like a number, we give your case apersonal touch!
for over two decades, jb thomas has served those who call virginia their home. in april of 2016,  however, he and j. aaron thomas (father and son) partnered together in an effort to distance themselves from the impersonal nature common in larger firms and to return the emphasis of legal counsel to where it belongs--on the client.
thomas & thomas law, pllc provides courtroom representation for individuals, military personnel, and small businesses, and delivers quality service at affordable rates, with low down payments and payment plans for legal services.
