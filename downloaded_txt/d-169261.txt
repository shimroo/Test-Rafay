easter riding in france | 17 aug 22



02:49:24 by mrs. dantesdame | views: 6940 | comments: 7
i hang my head in shame that it has taken me four months to get this trip down on my website. and to be honest, one of the key driving factors is that i have another (non-motorcycle) trip ready to be written. the delay meant that i forgot a lot of things, and for some reason i don't seem to have as many photos as i thought i did to choose from. but ignore my pathetic excuses. i present to you now, for your entertainment.... the loire valley at easterand as usual, here are some teaser texts and photos to help you decide if clicking the link is worth it  8)wednesdaybasel  langreswe were on our bikes shortly after noon on wednesday, having packed ligh...

will rogers fly in | 14 aug 22

saturday morning, i rode out to the annual will rogers fly in. it is held every august at the ranch in oologah, oklahoma, where rogers was born. about 100 planes show up to the grass field. it's cool because you can walk out into the field, look at the planes, and talk to the pilots. you can even stand right next to the runway as they take off and land. they also have craft sales, a car show, a classic camper show, food trucks, etc. i've been several times....

did someone ask for more dual-sport ride reports? | 10 mar 22



22:32:00 by jay547 | views: 13435 | comments: 70
sunday, feb. 20th, the weather was nice with a forecast high of 70°, so i went for a ride along the illinois river in northeastern oklahoma.i parked at my usual spot, edmundson public access.i headed north along the goat (green country oklahoma adventure trail). the road was in excellent condition. the gravel had been graded off to the side and there was just enough moisture in the dirt to make it tacky. it was like riding a twenty-mile long dirt track. zero tire slip. it was a blast.i found my new rive...

the goat ride | 21 apr 20



22:32:30 by jay547 | views: 30955 | comments: 37
the green country oklahoma adventure tour is a 438 mile, two day ride around the backroads of northeastern oklahoma. it was set to be run the weekend of april 18th but the chinese virus put an end to the official run. they had an unofficial partial tour on the 18th with about twenty riders. the tour is split into a north and a south section. i ran most of the north loop on april 10th, then on the 18th, i ran most of the south loop. north loop: i started in disney, oklahoma and ran the route the opposite direction of how its laid out. this direction worked out the best for me riding solo for just one day. here are some pictures i took along the way.an old wpa school....
