historythe history of bay area houston economic partnership dates back to 1976 when it was originally named the clear lake area economic development foundation (claedf). the effective date of claedf’s articles of incorporation was dec. 16, 1976, designated as the organization’s official anniversary date. in 2003, claedf rebranded itself under the name bay area houston economic partnership (bahep). bahep’s president and staff are responsible for the daily operations of the organization which is governed by a board of directors. membership investment almost exclusively funds the organization’s mission. bahep’s goal of attracting, retaining, and expanding industry within the region would not be possible without the financial support and valuable time given by its members. a number of member-driven committees engage in many of bahep’s initiatives. these committees are industry focused and address the needs of the aerospace, maritime, specialty chemical, healthcare, education, and small business sectors, among others.
