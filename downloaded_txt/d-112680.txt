a wonderful title my dear robin and fits the subject like a glove. there is still beauty left in these remains and the thoughts that it can't be long before we see it's decendants. well spotted and taken....best wishes to you as always.....ray  more...

photo project of the month 
project #78

railroads

this should be a fun project. there are railroads everywhere! from full size to table top and all sizes in between. steam engines, diesels, electric hand or pedal powered. tracks, signals, stations you name it railroad stuff is abundant and should make for some very interesting photos as railroads are all different depending on your location. so lets see some artistic photos related to railroads and railroading, including the crusty old engineers! have fun!
