expedition quest mobile app
our mobile app enables eq members to search for other local members by combining the expesearch index system with gps geo-location. want to meet or get advice from someone who has climbed, or is hoping to climb kilimanjaro? want to organize a local group of kayakers with class 3 experience to go down the snake river? perform a search within a 20 mile radius, check out their qualifications and experiences and send them a message. get together, share a cup of coffee or a couple of beers and make it happen.
