haiku, inc. financial report for 2024 is now available

news posted on sat, 2025-02-01 11:00

haiku-inc,
donations


the haiku, inc. financial report for 2024 is now available on the haiku, inc. documents page.
our donations for 2024 were higher than any other year, breaking all previous records by almost $10,000! even with some reasonably high expenses we still managed to have a net positive year.
in 2024 our contractor waddlesplash worked the whole year, and we had a new beta release.
we had some very generous large donations this year, which is part of what made this a record setting year.

[gsoc 2024]: implementing incremental search [final report]

blog post by calisto-mathias on sat, 2024-08-24 01:46

haiku,
software,
gsoc,
gsoc-24,
tracker,
user-interface


introduction the goal of this post is to document the changes i‚Äôve successfully made during the gsoc period, the current state of the project, future enhancement goals, and a few other topics. i also want to extend my thanks to the haiku developers and community for the opportunity to work on this fantastic operating system.
background haiku is a truly innovative operating system. one of its most interesting approaches to a filesystem lies in the fact that it makes metadata a primary characteristic of the filesystem.

[gsoc 2024] virtio sound: final report

blog post by diegoroux on thu, 2024-08-22 18:39

gsoc,

virtio,
sound,
video


gerrit submission. check out my final pull request here: 8141
overview during this gsoc period, i focused on developing the virtio sound driver for haiku, aiming to enhance its performance as a guest os in virtualized environments. this journey began with some challenges, for example, initially, i missed a small detail in the driver module path, which prevented the driver from loading.
one of the significant setbacks, i had, was understanding hmulti_audio.
