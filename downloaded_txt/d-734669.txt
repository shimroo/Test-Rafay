adjustable dumbells are part of any balanced fitness plan





while many focus upon the biological or medicinal side of acne, there are many researchers who are trying to see if there might be a natural cure to this disease; a disease which effects so many people.one commonality that these researchers are finding is that acne, although genetically passed on, can be controlled with diet. some scientists may disagree, but we've all heard the old adage, "what you put in is what you get out". this may be true with acne; even in it's most severe forms.first and foremost, obesity has been thought as a major factor contributing to acne. with an obese person, there is an increased activity in the glands of the body, and this includes the glands below hair follicles, which produce oil. losing weight and exercising each and every day may help immensely. this requires no drugs, just self-control and willpower.diet is another major concern for naturalists striving for a cure. they are finding that a diet rich in vegetable and fruit helps significantly balance hormones that effect glands. vegetables and fruit help keep the body in homeostasis, or in balance.the intake of fatty foods, such as trans fats, or those made from animal products (milk based products, i.e. margarine and even vegetable oils), also increases gland activity in the body. there is a type of oil; however, that may be good at fighting against acne.omega-3 oils, commonly found in fish and sea animals, is natural oil that is good for the body, especially for the skin. other foods that contain oils, sugars, caffeine, carbonization and heavy amounts of salts, should be avoided at all costs for sufferers of acne.tip! now it's time to re-write those goals. so move to a new page on your note pad and give it the same name again -- muscle and fitness goals refined.zinc, a mineral gaining much popularity in the natural world for its medicinal qualities, helps fight the clogging of pores that leads to acne. in the form of gluconate or sulfate, it helps the skin heal blemishes and helps to balance hormonal activity.zinc has recently been found to be as effective as prescription strength tetracycline. other vitamins, including vitamin a and b6 may help substantially in hormonal balance, resulting in clearer, healthier skin.in any case, the positive effects seen from the uses of natural medications and a proper diet cannot be ignored. even when compared to synthetic treatment options, natural healing with vitamins and minerals may help even the most severe cases.discover useful advice and information about the causes and prevention of acne. website contains useful articles and updated information on this nasty skin condition. http://www.acne-treatment-zap.com/acne-care.htmlsteve williams is a freelance writer, who suffered acne for many years. his research into prevention and acne cures have helped him, and other fellow sufferers.

dance for fitness - why the ballroom beats the treadmill





dancing can get your heart pumping as well as a treadmill but it will do even more, especially if you get out on a dance floor rather than going to a hip-hop, salsa or other dance-style aerobics class in a gym. in addition to toning muscles and staying in shape aerobically, ballroom dancers of all skill levels report feeling less stressed, having a more positive outlook on life, sleeping better, being more flexible, having more energy, being more alert mentally, and getting along better with other people. and you don't have to dance with the stars, become competitive or go through a dance boot camp to benefit."people forget how much fun it is to go out and move to music with other people," says judy gantz, founder and director of the center for movement education and research in los angeles and a faculty member at the university of california los angeles; "and dance requires somewhat complex coordination so it enhances your brain."researchers identify surprising benefitsat the albert einstein college of medicine in bronx, ny, researchers examined how exercise influences the risk of dementia by tracking 469 people over the age of 75 for a period of 5 years. they found that dancing was associated with a lower risk of dementia, while swimming, bicycling, participating in group exercises, playing team games such as bowling, walking for exercise, climbing stairs or doing housework did not offer the same benefit.other studies have shown some unexpected ways in which dance benefits people of different ages:* at the university of california irvine, medical students who took art and dance classes were better able to observe and empathize with their patients. * in sweden, elite cross-country skiers who did pre-season dance training experienced less back pain from skiing. * in a korean study, depressed teens experienced relief from dance therapy, and had measurably higher levels of serotonin. * in connecticut, breast cancer survivors who took part in a 12-week therapeutic dance program at a medical center in meriden improved their quality of life.calories burn fastaerobically speaking, dance matches many grunt-and-groan activities. researchers at the mayo clinic, based in rochester, mn, have estimated that dancing can burn 200 to 400 calories in 30 minutes and an evening of square dancing can equate to walking five miles. in addition, side-to-side dance movements help to prevent osteoporosis by strengthening weight-bearing bones.who's dancing?during the past few years, as dance-oriented television shows and movies have gained fans, people have been discovering ballroom dancing at a younger age. the national chain of arthur murray dance studios, going strong since 1912, is seeing more people in their twenties who want to prepare for a wedding or master latin moves. their students, more than 10,000 people per week, also include couples of all ages who dance for fun, and high-powered professionals who find that a dance floor relieves stress better than a gym.tip! body composition: considered as one of the components of fitness, composition refers to the body in terms of lean mass (muscle, bone, vital tissue, and organs) and fat mass. actually, the optimal ratio of fat to lean mass is an indication of fitness.competitive dance, known as dancesport, is recognized as a sport by the international olympic committee and popularity of both the sport and social dancing is growing dramatically. more than 300 colleges in the united states, including ivy league schools, offer ballroom dance programs.tip! find a physical fitness program that seems right for you.where to learncommercial dance schools aren't the only places where you can hone your moves -- universities, community colleges and community groups offer low-cost classes and events around the country. information about social and competitive dancing is also available from the united states amateur ballroom dancers association (www.usabda.org), which has grown from 12 local chapters in 1986 to more than 150 today."motivation plays a huge part in staying active," says gantz, "and there's a joy, when you work with music and other people, that is highly involving and motivating."about the authorvera tweed is a veteran health journalist and the editor of http://www.healthytricks.com, an online newsletter that makes a healthy lifestyle more convenient, enjoyable and attainable.
