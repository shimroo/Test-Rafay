st. anselm's abbey school

st. anselm's abbey school is an independent catholic, benedictine school for boys in grades 6 through 12, located in northeast washington, dc. students benefit from a challenging academic program, fine and performing arts, and a wide selection of extracurricular activities.









middle school
in the critical middle school years, st. anselm’s offers students a challenging, engaging academic program in the context of a supportive environment where each boy is known as an individual. 





upper school
by carefully increasing the sophistication and complexity of the course material to coincide with the continuing development of the students’ ability to think critically and abstractly, we provide the challenges and opportunities of a broad, liberal arts education that our students need to reach their potential and discover their unique talents and interests. 





student life
a great school isn't defined solely by what goes on in the classroom. every day, we seek to help our students find the "balance of mind, body, and spirit." through fine arts, clubs, athletics, and service opportunities we strive to develop the whole person of each boy.

testimonials





an abbey parent
benedictine values and the monks. the traditional approach works for the right boy and the small class size means that my boys are very well known at school. i have also been thrilled with the level of diversity in the student body. kudos to you all on that front in particular.




an abbey past and present parent
st. anselm's is a special place—on our first visit, we felt an immediate embrace of our son and of our entire family. over the years, our bond with the school and monastery has grown. we have been most impressed with the psychological and spiritual formation our boys received. this formation, in the benedictine tradition, is a bulwark in a rapidly changing and challenging world.




st. anselm's awarded ap platinum status 
st. anselm's abbey school has been awarded "platinum" status, the highest rank offered, by the college board for 2024. criteria for this status includes that at least 80% of students experience an ap course while enrolled in upper school, at least 50% earning a 3 (out of 5) on an ap exam, and at least 15% of students take at least five ap exams prior to graduating, with at least one exam taken either freshmen or sophomore year.  the abbey school has also notably been awarded the ap access award. criteria for this status entails that the percentage of underrepresented and/or low-income students who access the school's ap program is the same or greater than the percentage of the school's graduating class








visit

		the abbey is a special place, one where bright and motivated boys are both nurtured and challenged as they grow to become exceptional men. campus tours can be scheduled monday through friday. while in-person tours following cdc guidelines for social distancing are available, we can also arrange a digital zoom campus tour at your convenience.
