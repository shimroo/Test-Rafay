 winter art & antiques fair, olympia london 






the winter art & antiques fair 2024 is now closed. 
thank you to everyone who exhibited and to all who visited us this year! we are looking forward to welcoming you all back for winter art & antiques fair 2025.
the winter art and antiques fair provides a unique opportunity to not only appreciate entire collections in person but also to engage face-to-face with knowledgeable dealers, whose expertise will guide you through their century-spanning stock.  
catering to every taste and preference, the fair has something for everyone. whether you have a passion for traditional fine art, an affinity for 20th-century and contemporary pieces, or a love for timeless decoration, you’ll find it all here this november.  
the fair is the last major art and antiques fair before christmas and runs alongside the luxury travel fair and the spirit of christmas fair in the gallery level, grand hall at olympia london.
