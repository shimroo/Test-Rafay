					who we are
				





					we are joyce and scott brasted. we started brasted house creative ideas in 2002 when guests at our then b&b asked us to watch their chautauqua home that was being built that year. soon after that several other guests asked us for the same service. this business soon replaced the b&b.over the years we have expanded and added services. what started as a simple house watch service in the winter, now assures that homes are closed in the fall and opened in the spring, that landscaping is renewed and houses are clean. that winter curtains are up in the fall and down in the spring. that furnaces and air conditioners are checked. we oversee pest control and gutter and window cleaning and almost anything else you can think of that might need done. the list goes on and on.we want you to come to your home for the chautauqua season or for a visit in the off-season and find your home as if you had just come back from the store.we carry liability insurance in case of damage to your home caused by us.
