moving the world by our advanced technology
our solutions












































baggage software solutions

                                 airports face several challenges in optimizing the performance of their baggage handling systems (bhs). scarabee systems & technology delivers cutting edge software solutions and services that help airports to get the most out of their bhs.











self service bagdrop

                                 the most important challenges of airports today are the increasing passenger numbers, the limited terminal space and capacity, the focus on reducing costs and of course optimizing income. 











smart security lanes

                                 as passenger volumes continue to increase globally, airports are faced with mounting pressure to implement more efficient and accurate solutions across all passenger touchpoints, while prioritizing the passenger experience.
