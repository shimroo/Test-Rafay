another year, another successful mining indaba
a huge thank you to everyone who visited our stand at the german pavilion!
starting the year on a high note, mining indaba was the perfect opportunity to strengthen our connections with great conversations, new opportunities, and valuable insights. we had excellent meetings with senior representatives from our customers in africa, reinforcing the strong interest in mining solutions.
a special thanks to our clients and partners - it was fantastic catching up and exploring new opportunities together. we were also proud to be part of the @german pavilion, where cyplus and other german companies showcased a highly professional appearance and outstanding collaboration, offering a wide range of cutting-edge solutions for the mining industry.
