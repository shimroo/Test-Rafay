workforce strategies initiative
research and evaluation conducted by the economic opportunities program’s workforce strategies initiative explore strategies that help workers attain stability and mobility, including through training, education, and broader systems change. in the years since the end of the great recession, the unemployment rate has declined much faster than the poverty rate, and more and more americans are struggling to find work that allows them to support themselves and their families. wsi’s current research explores “raise the floor and build ladders” strategies, which improve the quality of low-wage jobs and promote mobility for low-wage workers.
