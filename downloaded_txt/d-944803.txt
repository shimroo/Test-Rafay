the korea hapkido federation is a world organization founded and located in south korea. hapkido is a globally respected martial art that was developed in the early 20th century and has been growing in popularity over the decades. the federation is lead by president oh se lim who has been instrumental in the art’s growth and respect around the world. his message has been one of inclusiveness, unity and humanity. he continues to encourage all hapkido practitioners to work together as one united mind. the value of hapkido is not only in its effective system of self-defense but also in the personal growth of the practitioner. the improved balance of mind, body and spirit leads to a better member of society and a more valued community member. we are blessed to have grandmasters around the world who teach and promote the art and it’s ideals.
