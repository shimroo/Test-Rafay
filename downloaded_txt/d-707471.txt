maine lobstering tours 
come join us for an unforgettable excursion on the waters of casco bay while we guide you through the daily routines of a maine lobsterman. participate in the excitement of hauling up the traps or sit back and relax as we cruise near picturesque lighthouses, historic civil war forts, and the “seal rocks”.
each of our lobster tours lasts for 80-90 minutes and passenger numbers are limited to ensure that everyone gets an up-close and personal maine lobstering experience.

you’ll see how these tasty treats get from the bottom of the ocean to your dinner plate and learn about lobster habits, conservation efforts and the difference between hard shells, shedders, shorts, culls, and keepers. any lobsters we catch can be purchased after the cruise for wholesale “boat” price, and if you don’t have a pot at home, take them across the pier to the portland lobster company restaurant for the freshest lobster dinner anywhere.

a diverse variety of marine life will enter a lobster trap, and some common visitors include rock crabs, snails, starfish, and hermit crabs. our see-thru “live tank” offers a chance to watch these little creatures until the end of the day when all are thrown back into the sea.

in addition to lobstering, the lucky catch can provide a wide selection of private charters including birthdays, corporate outings, cocktail cruises, bird watching and island dining transportation. if you have an idea for a custom charter, let us know and we’ll try to make it work for you!
