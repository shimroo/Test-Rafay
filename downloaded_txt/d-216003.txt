fear no feraltrap–neuter–return
do you have a colony of feral cats on your property? they are fabulous for keeping down vermin populations, but
				without spay/neuter, you could be trading one problem for another. we can help! our fear no feral
				trap-neuter-return program will provide traps, instructions, and pay all costs for spay/neuter, rabies
				vaccination, and "ear-tipping" of the cats in your colony. email us at  or leave a
				message for our feral coordinator at (509) 775-2308; let's keep your
				ferals working for you without overwhelming you!
