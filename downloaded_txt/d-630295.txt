about yasara - watching nature@work






yasara is a molecular-graphics, -modeling and -simulation program for windows, linux, macos and android developed since 1993, that finally makes it really easy to answer your questions. with an intuitive user interface, photorealistic graphics and support for virtual reality headsets, shutter glasses, stereoscopic displays and input devices, yasara creates a new level of interaction with the 'artificial reality', that allows you to focus on your goal and forget about the details of the program.
yasara is powered by pvl (portable vector language), a new development framework that provides performance way above traditional software. pvl allows you to visualize even the largest proteins and enables true interactive real-time simulations with highly accurate force fields on standard pcs, making use of gpus if available (see benchmarks). you can push and pull molecules around and work with dynamic models instead of static pictures.
being rooted in the academic world, all methods introduced by yasara are described in peer-reviewed journals. you can obtain the initial stage yasara view for free, while higher stages (yasara model, yasara dynamics, yasara structure) require a license fee that allows us to guarantee new developments, updates and support also in the future, independent of temporary grants. as a yasara user, you are not limited to the role of a consumer. you can extend yasara with macros, movies and plugins, or create gigastructures to share with the community.

what if yasara knows the answer?!






with over 5000 citations, what if is a widely used modeling program, well known e.g. for its structure validation and prediction tools. the what if / yasara twinset is a unified all-in-one distribution of the two programs with extended functionality. if you run the twinset what if, an additional yasara menu provides quick access to molecular simulations. and vice versa, users of the twinset yasara can simply run what if commands, so that what if inherits yasara's user interface, graphics engine, macro language and convenience functions like unlimited undo/redo. this approach makes what if quickly accessible, also to users outside the bioinformatics expert community.
