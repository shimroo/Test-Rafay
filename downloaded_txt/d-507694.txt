						mike and scott did a great job helping me with all my concerns when purchasing my vehicle and really making me feel valued and appreciated. i love the custom work they did on my vehicle by adding these new racing stripes as well!!! 5/5 customer service and would recommend repeat business.					





sebastian franklincustomer 






						tommie vaughn ford is the best! imagine an auto service department where you actually have an assigned service advisor that is knowledgeable, accessible & helpful - i always found having my car serviced a nightmare until i found tommie vaughn.  now i can take my car in easily, get it fixed the first time and actually have helpful communication with a real person so i can understand what's being done and why - and when it will really be ready. it's refreshing to be able to return to the days when good customer service was the norm rather than the exception. and their complementary lyft service is awesome...					





margot morriscustomer 






						cannot recommend the dealership enough! every interaction i had was great and i got a very fair price without having to haggle over random fees. lauren was a great salesperson--responsive over text while we found a vehicle and waited for it to come into the dealership and so helpful in learning about all the features i wanted/needed. the finance manager, andrea, was also great and very patient and helpful with my somewhat complex financing needs. if you are in the market for a ford,  you can't go wrong by visiting tommie vaughn!					





bethany rolancustomer 






						i ordered a raptor with david bagby on the fleet team and cannot say enough positive things about the smooth, drama-free process. david kept his word on our pricing and is an honest straightforward guy. we will without a doubt order our future fords with him.
