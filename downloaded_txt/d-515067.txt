    kt is taking action—on the trails and in the statehouse!

kt is taking action—on the trails and in the statehouse!
this 2025 legislative session, kt is teaming up with other amazing trail organizations through the vermont trails & greenway council, to advocate for h.147 a bill to establish the recreational trails compensation study.
why does this matter?
vermont’s outdoor recreation economy generates $2.1b annually, nearly 5% of the state’s gdp, that's 2nd in the nation after hawaii (go vt!) kt alone drives $10m in economic impact annually. therefore, the state must recognize and incentivize these generous private landowners, including the 106 who make kt possible and allow public access to trails.
