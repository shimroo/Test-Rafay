 carrie's last post it is with heavy hearts that my father, aunt carol and i write this.  over the last several days, carrie's health had been declining.  yesterday (sunday), carrie's family surrounded her; she was aware of their presence and they were able to say goodbye and to her tell her it was ok to let go.  today (monday), carrie was resting peacefully and at about 2:20 pm, god called her home.  she took her last breaths in the presence of my father and aunt carol.the expressions of sincere and heartfelt encouragment and prayers from everyone, including those she had strenous differences of opinion with, have provided great comfort and strength to carrie and her family.   her blog gave her a great sense of purpose and fulfillment; she enjoyed corresponding with the people she encountered here.  thank you for your readership and she appreciated your support over the years.  we are sure carrie is looking down on all of us now and smiling.  she might even be asking the all knowing about some of "the non-sense" in the church.  please remember her in your prayers on easter sunday.  tennatively, the funeral is planned for tues, april 14.  the next week will most likely be hectic for all of us.  if there is a desire to communicate, you can do it through my father at paul1204@sbcglobal.net.

carrie continues to rest at home with the help of hospice, a home health aid, her sister-inlaw (carol) and her husband (me). she continues to slide toward a final resting and will be deeply missed. she has received the sacraments of holy communion and anointing of the sick on multiple occasions over the last few weeks.we wish to thank you for your prayers and support and request that these continue. she gets an uplift when i read her your comments from my email (paul1204@sbcglobal.net). thank you,paullabels: carrie's  condition

 cancer journal update carrie is coming home from the hospital late tomorrow morning.  my dad has been reading your posts to her in the hospital and says she really perks up when he does so.  someone asked about how to send well wishes/cards.  if possible, i think electronic cards are best.  several sites will do it for free such as smilebox (but that requires a download).  you can send cards/well wishes/emails to paul1204@sbcglobal.net and dad will make sure she gets them.

 cancer journal update this is carrie's daughter.  she is no longer able to put up posts herself but wanted to update everyone on her situation.since my mom's last post everyday tasks have become more and more challenging.  on the 9th, she was walking while hanging onto her bed when she blacked out and fell.  thankfully she didn't break anything!  shortly afterwards, she decided to enroll in a palliative care program and hospice.  it seems there are no more drugs to use to fight her type of cancer.  now the goal is to make her quality of life as good as possible.  unfortunately, since the fall she has become bed ridden and her prognosis has changed.  before she was given 2-7 months to live; however, in the last 2 weeks that changed, the new prognosis is weeks to months. i am sorry to say that in the last several weeks there is a very visible decline in her physical abilities.  she also says she's dizzy and sees 2 of things.  thankfully she doesn't feel any pain, hospice is doing an excellent job of making sure she is comfortable.she is currently in the hospital for a minor complication from a cathedar.  hopefully she will be back home soon.thank you for your loyalty and concern in checking this message board.  i am sorry it has been so long since you have gotten an update, i check the board often and let her know what you say.  unfortunately she can't remember how to log in to things anymore so it's taken me a while to figure this out.  i will put updates on this board as they come and will read your posts to her.god bless you all, you've done more for her than you'll ever know!

cancer journal - updatei was in the hospital four days and am now at home and going for radiation treatments on my brain every day...a brain that does not function normally yet, making blogging nearly impossible.  my feet still will not go where i try to put them, so i can't do much.  hopefully by the end of the treatments that will change.  i'm halfway through them.hubby's aunt was supposed to be getting better and returning to the nursing home yesterday.  we haven't tried to call her yet today.  it's not clear whether her problem was pneumonia or heart problems.    at 96 it could certainly have been either, and we are reluctant to put her through too many tests, as she is herself.thank you for all the prayers.  i'm grateful and i pray god's blessings on all who pray for me.
