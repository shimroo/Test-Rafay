i'm making yet another attempt to climb back on to the social bandwagon, and this time it's by rejuvenating my technology oriented blog. so if you are interested in geeky stuff, you might want to head to geek whorled. i intend to write there about programming (java, opengl, gtk, python, etc), gadgets that interest me or that i own (including doing product reviews), linux, and anything that i feel is too geeky for this blog.if i can keep the tempo up, i also hope to post more on this blog as a side-effect.

the power of the pink chaddi

the pink chaddi campaign is probably the most amazing use of humour (and love, supposedly) that i have ever seen. the alternative law forum, under the guise of the "consortium of pubgoing, loose and forward women", have come up with the unique idea of sending thousands of 'pink chaddis' (though they later clarified that they no longer 'colour-discriminate') to pramod muthalik, the infamous perpetrator of supposedly indian culture-prescribed violence against women in a pub in mangalore. the one statement from the man that really stood out for me wasif they had to oppose something, they could have talked it out with us.apparently, he thinks indulging in violence is acceptable, but in a non-violent campaign is not.in any case, the support for the campaign has been so great that they collected more than 19,000 'chaddis' within a week, and started requesting people to send their packages directly.i think with a little more organization and some sponsorship (like maybe from kohinoor, archies/hallmark and vip/jockey), this could become the standard response to any party or group that indulges in activities that "don't reflect indian culture".what say?

my  city is under attack

on
thursday, november 27, 2008
posted by
rajesh j advani


labels:
mumbai terror attack


as i write this, it's been more than 18 hours since the first of the terror strikes was reported in south mumbai. the news channels won't report anything else, some of the presenters have been awake all night reporting on events as they emerge, and it seems to me like the whole city must be glued to their television sets waiting for all this to end.i slept at around 2:00am last night, refusing to continue watching the news, expecting that things would be more or less resolved by the time i woke up. even the news of top cops losing their lives, only made me believe that everything that needed to be done was being done. i resolved to not let the terror get to me, as that seemed like conceding defeat to the terrorists. and yet, i woke at 7:30am (an event in itself), and without bothering to brush my teeth, walked into the living room and turned the tv on.if i were to track my mood since then, i'd say that i started the day simply assimilating all the information that all the different news channels beamed at me, still hopeful that things would end 'soon'. seeing the taj mahal hotel burning, was the first shock. the second shock was when i heard that the college classmate of an acquaintance died in the firing at cafe leopold. it always makes more of an impact when you feel you are connected to someone who was affected. it could so easily have been you. then there were the photographs of the terrorists themselves. they could easily pass off as visitors of the hotels and restaurants they have terrorized, if not for the weapons they carried.a doctor from inside the taj call up a news channel and said she was in a group of around 35 people, and that there was one person whom she was trying to take care of, who had been shot in the abdomen, and had been bleeding all night. she was speaking very calmly and tried to highlight the fact that the man urgently needed medical attention. in a second call from her a while later, she seemed extremely distraught. this while some people seemed to be leaving the taj and were carried away in ambulances and best buses. the news  presenters are tired and desperate for good news. every assault by the army is termed the "final leg of the assault on the terrorists". my father then told me that his cousin apparently visited cafe leopold almost every wednesday, last night being an exception. she and her mother who lives in a building close to nariman house are both safe.hours went by, and very little seemed to change. the hope i initially had, was replaced with fear, fear turned to sorrow, and sorrow turned to despair. stop attacking my city, a part of me screams. end this insanity now.and i'm dozens of kilometers away from where the main action is still on. even 3-4 kilometers away from the marriot in juhu - the closest place to here where firing took place. this is the first time that i'm actually in mumbai when terror has stuck here. all the other times, i was either in chennai or in the us. and yet, a terror attack that has lasted for so long, can hardly compare with bomb blasts that are over in a short span of time. there is going to be a difference in the psychological impact of events that last an hour, versus events that last a whole day.i thank all the soldiers, firemen and police personnel that have been involved in trying to end this stand-off, and hope that it all gets over soon.

ubuntu on my desktop

on
monday, october 27, 2008
posted by
rajesh j advani




i've been using ubuntu hardy heron desktop linux (8.04) since april, when i got myself a new desktop pc. there was no way i was going to inflict vista on my new hardware, and i'd really liked the ease of using ubuntu server edition the one year before that, at work. the configuration of my custom-built pc is -intel core 2 duo e8200 (2.66 ghz)intel dg33fb atx motherboardcorsair 2gb ramtwo seagate sata 7200rpm 160gb disk drivesantec atx cabinetasus 20x dvd-rw drive with lightscribesapphire radeon hd 2600xt 512 mbmy choice of an ati-based graphics card was based on the fact that ati seems to be a lot more dedicated to developing open-source drivers than nvidia. they've released their gpu specs, which means anyone can write their own drivers without hacking or reverse-engineering the proprietary binaries, and without worrying that their driver will stop working with the next batch of the chip because some behaviour changed. this means that while currently nvidia has the best support, the future will favour ati. it was definitely a gamble, but picking a manufacturer that supports open source, felt right.installing ubuntu is a breeze. i had downloaded the iso for the 64-bit version, from the ubuntu site and burnt it a cd. i booted off this cd, and except for selecting the language, timezone, and partition sizes (which i like to customize), just sat back and watched ubuntu install itself - in under 20 minutes. and at the end of the installation, i had everything - display, sound, internet, music and video players, cd-burning tools, internet tools, a bittorrent client, office software, and even games (including sudoku). when i tried to install windows xp on the same machine in dual-boot mode, just getting the os installed took more than 40 minutes. then i had to install the motherboard drivers, the display drivers, and the monitor drivers. i only wanted xp to play my copy of need for speed underground 2, but if i had wanted to use xp for normal purposes, i would have spent the next few hours installing norton 360, ms office, and some internet tools. talk about a waste of time!the only things i changed after installing ubuntu, were used 'restricted' (meaning closed-source) drivers from ati, which work a lot better than the open-source ones at this timeinstalled the msttcorefonts package, which contains some microsoft developed true-type fonts, including the ubiquitous verdanaturned on desktop effects (compiz fusion)installed the compizconfig-settings-manager package to customize the compiz settings to my likingthe fonts and drivers are not installed by default, for legal reasons. closed-source drivers and fonts must be selected by the user specifically. compiz fusion - a compositing window manager that makes vista's aero obsolete - is still not as stable on large number of machines, and won't work on many embedded graphics card so for simplicity, it's turned off until you specifically turn it on. see this compiz fusion demo and find out why linux users are so thrilled. and before you ask - no, you can't get this working on windows.i'm a complete geek, but one thing i noticed about ubuntu is the fact that - as advertised - it just works. it'll be a lot easier for you to teach your grandparents to use ubuntu, than to use vista. desktop linux is definitely here to stay.the latest version of ubuntu - intrepid ibex (8.10) - will be out in 3 days. so head to the ubuntu site and try it for yourself.note: here are some good articles if you've never setup a dual-boot system before -how to dual-boot vista with linux (vista installed first) -- the step-by-step guide with screenshotshow to dual boot windows xp and linux (xp installed first) -- the step-by-step guide with screenshots
