old temecula valley



"-

                    as dawn touches off the peak of mount palomar, the

                glorious expanse of heaven may be glimpsed. yet in the shadow of the geological giant is

                hidden an eden, a little piece of heaven on earth nestled in a valley of harmonious

                existence.-"

below is a musical
                  instrument called a theremin that i designed over a twenty year period,
                  the accomplishment was like
          finishing a marathon in the dark and everyone
           already went home. i sent it to russia for the original inventor
                  leon theremin's 100 year invention anniversary.












also here is a sample of the
spirit of my angel
captured by my instrument as she talks to me,
           she seems sad
          about the world today.
