what people are saying about 



zagers pool & spa 










we bought a house 5 years ago, with an above ground pool. neither of us had ever owned a pool. zagers' classes on how to open and close a pool were so needed and helpful. they make caring for your pool simple by testing your water sample and telling you exactly what you need to do and how to do it. they are always very friendly and eager to help with whatever questions i have. 


jodi t. 






just got our jacuzzi üôÇ after visiting the holland store and working with mike we decided to make our purchase. mike answered our lengthy list of questions happily and was very helpful! we had a seamless delivery from the crew and are ready to use this! 


rachel b. 






thanks again for all your help with my pool.  you were great in answering all my questions and working with my numbers. i appreciate your kindness. 





d. jordan 






thank you so much for arranging delivery for a new -- non-puckered -- skin for our hot tub. your customer service is outstanding! 


nancy o. 






we just wanted to say thank you for all your help throughout the entire pool process. everyone was so kind and helpful.  we truly appreciate that!  we are loving the warmer weather and enjoying every moment in the pool.  thanks again for everything you've done and continue to do! 


vanderwoude family 






after purchasing our doughboy pool from you about 30 years ago, we just wanted to thank you for being an exceptional business and let you and your staff know you were appreciated through the years.
