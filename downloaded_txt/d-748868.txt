because many of the articles contained in this site have been overtaken by time, i have decided to remove all of them until further notice. in the meantime, i would like invite everyone to visit the blot http://www.batasayti.blogspot.com. in this age of information and technology, we really need to know more about the law as well as our rights on "cyberspace".
