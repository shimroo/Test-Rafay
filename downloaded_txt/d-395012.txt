the newest technique page shows how to imitate the look of stone.

my foray into clay and what came of it
the polymer clay faq
polymer clay techniques





the jewelry gallery
original jewelry and tchotchkas created in polymer clay, wirework, and beads. (come see the roses!)




my shoebox
whatever didn't fit anywhere else: various essays, jeremiads, and rants, links, and documents that are here only because they don't seem to be anywhere else on the web.

why cauce's "smith bill" isn't a good idea
the zumabot's tale
my rotating .signature file
the search warrant for the branch davidian residence outside waco
	...and more...





bad web designer, no cookie
an irregularly-published (i.e. whenever i can't take it any more) column dedicated to mercilessly whomping bad web design. our newest entry: socially-responsible use of pics ratings found!




technical services
nrrd for rent to do technical documentation, prototyping, and web design. my résumé is available, with more information to come.




apple guide

apple guide faqs
elko: a tool for indexing apple guides

house o' hypercard
the script of the month page (the
latest is hypertalk's
bnf grammar), plus my hypercard books (hypertalk 2.2: the book and tricks of the hypertalk masters), and a few useful hypercard resources.




shameless vanity
personal stuff, pictures, my geek code, you get the idea.
