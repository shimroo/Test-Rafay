“an outstanding dog agility facility! well-run, climate-controlled, amazing artificial turf, top-notch equipment, great lighting.  it takes me six hours to drive to countryside agility and (despite having competition opportunities closer to home) my dogs and i opt to visit here several times a year. the owner, denise, is a true lover of dogs, awesome agility competitor and instructor, and runs an excellent program. five stars!”

“clean, user-friendly building, loads of parking and crating, in-filled turf running surface, efficient and accurate trial secretary, solid and safe equipment, plenty of space to warm up, great viewing area... and that’s just about agility trials. lessons are also wonderful- thoughtful progressions from foundations through master’s level!”

— barbara t.
