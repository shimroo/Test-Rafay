when re-designing this existing bath, it was all about making the space feel bigger. here are some design tricks we used. no matter the size of your bathroom, wall-hung units are the best for visually making it appear you have more square footage by revealing the open floor area beneath. clever tile ideas can be used to create the illusion of height. in this small bath the decorative tiles run across the floor and up the back wall of the shower to the ceiling. the addition of a companion tile for the side walls creates an elegant scheme while still maintaining a contemporary vibe. some of the best small bathroom ideas are about creating space for storage, including your tub/shower area. installing a niche is beneficial. and for the jewelry of the room consider upgrading your fixtures. here we used champagne bronze. #bathroomdesign #bathroomremodel #countryclubplaza #delta #showplacecabinetry #ckf #tiles










turning this country club plaza penthouse condo into an open concept floor plan took some maneuvering but the end result is stunning. this kitchen features striking graphite cabinetry, solid walnut waterfall countertops and copper accents. the graphite cabinets contrast well with the rich coloration of the walnut countertops. gleaming copper hardware and bar shelf supports finish off this dramatic kitchen. #kitchendesign #kitchenremodel #kitchenrenovation #showplacecabinetry #southsidewoodshop #countryclubplaza










this penthouse unit on the country club plaza provides beautiful views but when the client wanted to add a second bath to this concrete constructed condominium we needed to get creative with routing the plumbing. the step up shower was the solution.
the wall-mounted toilet saves space, makes for easier cleaning, and has a modern look. we went with a patterned tile on the floor to add visual interest and paired it with a marbled porcelain wall tile to complete the bath. #bathroomdesign #bathroomremodel










after and before removing the wall between kitchen and dining.










some after/before comparison.










this small kitchen has a place for everything and everything in its place. #showplacecabinetry #kitchendesign #kitchenremodel #storagesolutions #storageideas

cabinets are getting installed. i love to locate tray storage in a cabinet above the refrigerator but in this kitchen we needed to find another location. swipe to see the handy pull-out for trays ü§ì #showplacecabinetry #kitchenremodel #kitchendesign #kitchenrenovation #cabinetry
