explore new york’s jewish history, yesterday and today ... on the lower east side.



preserve and educatethe lower east side jewish conservancy is a non-profit educational organization, created in 1998, with a mission to celebrate, preserve, and share the jewish heritage of new york city's neighborhoods, starting with the iconic lower east side. the conservancy's deeply knowledgeable guides will lead you on a fascinating exploration of the lower east side's jewish sites. you can attend one of our public tours on a particular subject, or your group can sign up for a special private tour which we craft for your interests at no extra charge. all proceeds go to support the conservancy's work preserving the neighborhood's exceptional patrimony.









































































































a sacred mission



the conservancy’s primary goal is to preserve the synagogues and heritage of the lower east side, america’s most famous immigrant neighborhood, and present them to the public. through our efforts, many have been designated as historic landmarks, and have been listed on new york state and national registers. in 2000, the conservancy assisted in designating a 32 – block area as a historic district. we accomplish our goal by designing touring programs, both private and public, which showcase the lower east side’s landmarks, history and people.















preserving our legacy



the lower east side jewish conservancy is the only non-profit organization dedicated solely to the historic preservation of the lower east side’s sacred sites. the conservancy has formed relationships with the leaders of all of these sacred sites. it is these professional relationships that open doors for our visitors. a portion of the proceeds of each tour is returned to the sacred sites visited on that tour, contributing to their restoration and conservation.
