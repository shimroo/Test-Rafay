first, the juice is fresh; therefore, it's full of live enzymes which helps the body.second, when juice is fresh, it hasn't been pasteurized. unfortunately, although pasteurization has saved many lives, it has also brought on its own problems such as nutritionally dead foods. vegetables juices in cans or boxes have been pasteurized. the high heat required for pasteurization destroys vital nutrients within the juice. many vegetable juices you buy will have a nutritional analysis on the can, but unfortunately, the nutritional analysis is done before pasteurization and thus can be misleading and even potentially false. by making your own fresh juice, you avoid the pasteurization process thus saving all of the nutrients and enzymes.third, it's easier to drink more vegetables than you can eat! we all know how important vegetables are to the human body, but unfortunately, it's not always possible to eat as many vegetables as we should. drinking fresh vegetable juice helps take care of this problem. but, you must remember to juice responsibly. fourth, you make the digestion and assimilation of the nutrition easier for your body. believe it or not, but your body is essentially a juice machine. when you eat a carrot, your body will digest the carrot and extract the juice to get the nutrition. by juicing, you extract the juice for your body. in turn this makes it easier for your body to assimilate the nutrition as your body doesn't need to work at breaking down the fruit or vegetable. while juicing saves your body the energy required to extract the juice (nutrition) from the food, it's still important to eat whole vegetables and fruits because your body still requires the fiber.fifth, fresh juice tastes absolutely delicious.you know, the funny thing is that when you juice because you enjoy drinking fresh juice, the whole experience becomes enjoyable! why? because you are no longer focused on obtaining health, worrying about disease — all of which distracts you from enjoying the moment. as bobby mcferrin once said, "don't worry, be happy!"nothing newjuicing is not a new idea. it's been around for a long time. thanks to individuals like the jay kordich, aka "the juiceman", juicing has been given a lot of publicity.since juicing is nothing new, neither is the information contained within juicingbook.com.the "juicing book" at juicingbook.com is simply information that has been collected from various sources and then organized for your benefit. however, while the information is nothing new, the approach i take to juicing comes from a slightly different angle or perspective.many glamorize juicing just to sell their juicers or books. me, i am not interested in that. i have no juice machine sales quota nor am i under any pressures to sell copies of my book (especially since i let everyone read my book online for free).my approach is to actually remove both the glamor and hype and make juicing more practical — admittedly, this might make the concept of juicing boring, but the benefit is that then you will be more likely to incorporate juicing into your life for the long term.at juicingbook.com i am a strong advocate of what i refer to as "responsible juicing", a concept you won't find anywhere else. i've also added the nutritional analysis for as many fruits and vegetables as possible so you can more easily discover what nutrients you are getting from your juice. the main reason why i added the nutritional analysis is so people, like you, will especially become more aware of the sugar content of the juice you are drinking. this approach to juicing is definitely different to others and while the approach may be different, the underlying theme is the same or similar to others.ultimately, i've added my own style of juicing to juicingbook.com and as you begin to juice, you will create your own style too. at this point, we'll both be groovin' to our own beat!consult your doctorwhen you juice, you are drinking a concentrated form of the vegetable and/or fruit. at the same time, the nutrients are released into the bloodstream a lot faster. this is especially true for sugar.therefore, if you have any health problems especially sugar related health problems, then you will want to consult your medical doctor, naturopathic doctor, nutritionist, etc. before juicing.also consult your health care professional if you are on medication as some fruits and/or vegetables may conflict with your medication.
