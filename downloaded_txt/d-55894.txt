welcome to the osu leadership center 

the osu leadership center is led by a group of professionals dedicated to providing leadership-centered education and research to individuals, organizations and communities. we provide high-quality, practical programs to build and strengthen leadership capacities. 
created in 1990, the center is located on the columbus campus of the ohio state university and is a part of the departments of agricultural communication, education, and leadership and osu extension. our mission is to provide research-based resources and high-quality practical programs to build and strengthen leadership capacities that make a positive difference in the lives of ohio's citizens.

     this year, we are celebrating 32 years of hands-on workshops and strength-based training activities to both organizations and individuals.
     “our workshops are accessible, affordable and applicable. our participants leave with new ideas and tools that they can apply immediately,” said beth flynn. 
    instructor tom stewart said, “i think these workshops are important because it helps people transform their lives. nothing is more important than being able to really improve someone’s life and in many cases the leadership center does just that!”
     communication and conflict management, strength-based training, leadership development, and team building are just some of the courses offered by the center. 
     stewart added, “i think the future is unlimited for the ohio state leadership center. i actually think we are just scratching the surface right now. there is great potential for this program to expand.”

in a world that is constantly moving, where productivity and results are often front and center, emotional intelligence (ei) can feel like a quiet, invisible force. however, ei is a pillar of personal and professional success, shaping how we interact with others, make decisions and navigate life's challenges.

when i was applying to the fourth cohort of the agone program the main thought in my mind was using this opportunity to grow in my role as a leader. from looking at my true self, to building my own personal legacy and learning to be a stronger leader, i found the topics inspiring and thought provoking.
