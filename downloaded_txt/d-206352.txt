what makes wciu so different?we use a systems approach to understanding development workmany development workers feel ill-equipped to handle problems they encounter in their communities. this is because the solutions to these problems are not simple or surface-level. these problems are historically, culturally, and theologically intertwined and complex. a systems approach takes all the factors into account to solve the root causes of an issue. this results in lasting solutions that truly help people and communities develop.become a leader who sees the bigger picture and deals with issues down to the root.
