stress relief
in our high-speed, always-on world, stress is a common challenge that we all face. regular massages help to alleviate stress by promoting relaxation and giving your mind a break from the everyday hustle and bustle. plus, massages release endorphins – the body’s natural ‘feel-good’ chemicals, which help you feel more relaxed and happy.
muscle tension release
whether you’re a fitness enthusiast or you spend most of your day sitting at a desk, you’re likely to experience muscle tension. regular massages can help to alleviate this discomfort by releasing tension and helping to break down any knots in your muscles. this can improve your range of motion, flexibility, and overall physical performance.
improved sleep
if you struggle with sleep, regular massages might be just the ticket. massages help to relax your mind and body, making it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep. it’s no secret that quality sleep is crucial for your overall health and wellbeing, so this benefit should not be overlooked.
boosted immunity
regular massages can also help to boost your immune system. massage stimulates the lymphatic system, which helps your body to fight off infections and diseases. this can result in fewer sick days and a greater feeling of vitality and health.

relax and enjoy

2023-02-23 by ben kein 


빠르게 변화하는 현대 사회에서 스트레스와 만성 피로로 인해 근육통과 질병을 경험하는 사람들이 점점 더 많아지고 있습니다. 이에 따라 근육을 이완시켜주는 마사지에 대한 수요가 점차 증가하고 있으며, 미용 효과나 건강을 위해 전문 마사지 숍을 찾는 사람들도 늘고 있습니다. 최근 근육을 전문적으로 관리하는 새로운 웰빙 관리법이 등장했는데, 바로 “딥 티슈 마사지 테라피“입니다.
“딥 티슈 마사지 테라피”는 근육 건강 증진을 목적으로 연구된 마사지 중 하나로, 선진국에서는 건강 마사지 분야의 전문가들이 사용하고 있습니다. 이 유형의 마사지는 특별한 목적을 위해 동일한 유형의 세포가 모여 있는 조직인 근육과 근막의 깊은 층을 관리하는 데 중점을 둡니다. 딥 티슈 마사지는 문제가 되는 과일 축의 경직, 단축 및 협착을 관리하고 근육 근막을 감소시키는 것으로 국제 마사지 커뮤니티에서 호평을 받고 있습니다. 기존 근육 마사지와 달리 근육의 골격 부착 부위인 시작점과 정지점에서 근육 조직 방향으로 진행되는 해부학적 마사지로, 특히 만성 근육 문제 관리에 적합하다.
전문가들은 딥티슈 마사지 테라피를 통해 짧아지고 통증이 있는 근육과 근막 조직을 늘려 정상 길이로 되돌릴 수 있고, 심부 근육 조직을 마사지해 피부 트러블과 비만 관리에도 도움이 될 수 있다고 설명합니다. 또한 심부 조직 마사지에는 다음과 같은 장점이 있습니다:

beautiful 유흥사이트 garter belt
sleeping beautiful, fitting, at home, surrounded with everything desirable, the idea of being filled with desire, not being tied up with the needs of the jolie- barker- lombardi family in uncertain times. descending the long and built steps with saddle shoes, a skirt, miniature chains, and the most excitement a girl can muster, she finally finds herself in bed, and the pj’s that she so painstakingly put on, recently on top of the list.
babydoll panties, skin-tight striped tees, and see-through lace all play a role in what will transpire at the end of the bedtime story. and somewhat simultaneously, the thought of attentively fingering and then providing oneself with a real selection of thigh highs on the bed, with a sizzling evening pant just waiting for the moment the stairs should begin to creak above her as she rises to the light switch. just what makes the entire romantic notion of evenings so very enticing? what is the significant thing, the entire ensemble, that will cause a woman to feel sexy and at the same time look sexy? and this is only brought out in the form of ambience, which usually subliminally portrays the type of provocative nature that has the potential to turn heads.

the history of the massage 
2023-02-242023-01-04 by warren fleming 


the massage word has a great deal of connotations and nuances associated with it these days. but whether the word massage or massage therapy is being used in the phrases used to describe the professionals activities or the professionals activities is still not completely clear.
the term massage is derived from the latin phrase ‘morsum’. this means ‘resting place’ and was first used in the context of a professional massage practise in the 1929 book by various -oulder. the term made its appearance in the context of a medical discipline having something to do with the periodic return of the human body to the original elements.
more recently the term has been used in the phrases ‘ocially necessary stresses’ and ‘differential processing’. in statements that undertake stress testing it is essentially assumed that the specialists understand that these tests aim to identify stressful situations and that normal stress is not the problem. it would be subtly incorrect to say that stress is the reason for the differential in results of these tests. guide to recommended websites – 강남안마사이트
historical background
let’s briefly highlight the history of this discipline. in massage therapy: a shoveled perfection, theropodologist edward lorenz an oxford professor, wrote an article in the magazine as a research for a book he was editing. in the article, entitled “shoan construction technology” herefer to the works of ioannes matching techniques. in the article, the laboratories of this technology are referred to as a “job laboratory”. this phrase was first used by him in the context of occupational disciplines and is now also used often by 강남안마 위치 other authors.
eugene allen, better known as the “tuesdays mechanics” also refers to this technique. in 1950’s, during the late 1920’s and early 1930’s, he developed and taught this principle to the americans.
after the collapse of the stock market in 2008 it was again highlighted in the press. the skyscrapers of new york were brought down indirected strikes in 1999. and again in 2001, the london morning peak was tainted with the terrorist attacks of 11 september attacks.
today, stress is increasingly a problem for corporations and governments around the world. the nature of stress is dependent on the relation of personnel, stockholders, supervisors, customers as well as internal employees. conducting stress testing of employees is a proceedure in many countries.
a variety of methods are in place to combat the increase in stress. in most countries, mandatory retirement age of at least forty is being udated. at least thirty is being the norm in the united states of america, but at least one company out of london is fighting such a practice in court.
stock options & equity securities
when acquiring company’s stock, be aware of certain “mistakes” that can occur. some of these “mistakes” can reduce your overall value of the shares you are purchasing. other “mistakes” affect your ability to realize a profit or even worse, hinder your ability to do so.
take time to consult a financial advisor. they are trained to help you “oversee” or develop a financial contingency plan based on the overall interests of the client. a advisor well oracleses the legal aspects of mutual fund and stock purchase. it is important to develop the plan as a joint effort of both you and the advisor.
before you act, be certain you know each other. contact your advisor and discuss your mutual fund and stock purchase. this will also require you to present to him or her your financial details as well as unitholder information. the mutual fund and stock brokerage company must be notified of your plans to purchase their common stock. it is important to understand what rights you are entitled to as a common stockholder. what could be the repercussions of letting your new employer know of your intentions?
before you subscribe to any funds, be sure you understand your mutual fund’s investment performance. let’s say, you wish to play money management on a regular basis? what happens if you only need to invest in a fund for 6 months? what if it swings to the other extreme? this is where your advisor can help you create a more efficient investment plan. according to the advisor, if you change the standard manually, it would be more expensive than keeping the current one.
mutual funds
your mutual fund should illustrate illustrate cyclical movements in stocks, since you are the one who will be investing with your money. depending on the fund’s investment performance, you will be able to use extra money to cover short-term financing needs. does the fund have a low expense ratio? it means more return for you as a shareholders.






지지안마 스웨덴 마사지 
2023-02-072022-10-24 by ben kein 


스포츠에서는 근육이 뻣뻣해지는 것을 막고 통증을 예방하기 위해 근육을 문지르는 것이 일반적입니다. 프로 스포츠 경기에서, 이 마사지는 신체 내의 아드레날린의 양을 줄이는데 도움을 주기 때문에 의료진과 피트니스 직원들 모두에게 흔하게 제공되는데, 이것은 운동선수들이 불안과 고통을 경험할 때입니다.
마사지 기법은 양손과 팔꿈치를 전신에 걸쳐 펴서 하는 것이 독특합니다. 관절은 양전하와 음전하이고, 관절은 양전하와 음전하로 손바닥과 발이 함께 있는 곳에서 음전하를 냅니다. 이렇게 하면 신체의 각 관절이 양전하되고 아래 관절이 음전하되는 신체의 균형이 만들어집니다.
ft 소프트 마사지 기법은 얕은 컵을 사용하여 압박감을 느끼지만 충분히 아프지 않도록 하는 것입니다. 이것은 근육과 관절로 가는 혈류를 촉진시켜 그들이 긴장을 풀 수 있게 합니다. 정기적으로 마사지를 받는 사람들은 부상과 질병이 발생하기 전부터 발견하기 쉽습니다. 이것은 유연성을 높이고 부상이 발생하지 않도록 하는 데 이상적입니다.
지지안마 마사지를 할 때, 그것은 손에서 뼈로 압력을 전달함으로써 수행되는데, 이것은 몸에 간접적인 압력을 만듭니다. 지지안마의 전문 스웨디시 마사지 장점은 외부로부터 오는 스트레스를 치료할 수 있다는 것인데, 이는 그 사람이 육체적으로 스트레스를 느끼지 않을 것이라는 것을 의미하지만, 그것은 또한 마른 피부, 나쁜 자세 등과 같은 신체의 문제들을 목표로 하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다.
스웨덴 마사지는 다양한 건강 문제를 위한 치료법으로 인식되어 왔습니다. 여기에는…이 포함되지만 이에 국한되지는 않습니다.
· 니아와 유방 감염입니다.
· 근육의 긴장감입니다.
· 몸의 과열입니다.
· 체액의 누적 손실은 노화됩니다.
· 늙어가는 뻣뻣한 목입니다.
· 허리의 통증입니다
· 당신의 면역 체계입니다.
· 당신의 순환계입니다.
· 당신의 신경계입니다.
· 당신의 소화기 계통이요
· 당신의 내분비계입니다.
· 당신 뼈요
· 강조하세요
· 두려워해요
아로마테라피로 불안을 해소하는 방법

스웨덴 마사지의 사용은 또한 사람들이 마사지와 침 치료로부터 회복하는 것을 돕기 위해 널리 사용되었습니다. 이러한 처리 시스템에서 압력은 스타일 a에서 스타일 b로 전달되어 신체 또는 입자의 움직임을 한 압력 지점에서 다른 압력 지점으로 흐르게 합니다. 스웨덴식 접근법으로 마사지 요법을 사용하면 신체가 독소를 배출하고 혈액 순환을 촉진하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 물론 더 나은 건강을 얻기 위한 많은 다른 방법들이 있습니다 – 인터넷에서 검색하면 무수히 많은 것을 얻을 수 있습니다. 하지만, 제 생각에, 신체의 해독을 지원하기 위해 스웨덴 기술을 사용하는 것은 질병과 질병의 근본 원인을 제거하기 위해 발견된 가장 효과적인 방법 중 하나입니다.
활동과 방해로 가득 찬 다사다난한 하루를 보낸 후, 마침내 집에 도착했을 때, 여러분은 피곤하고, 스트레스를 받고, 감정적으로 느낄 수 있습니다. 마음을 가라앉히고 적절한 수면을 취하는 것은 어려울 것이고, 그래서 아이스크림이나 컵을 사게 될 것입니다. 잠을 자는 동안, 여러분은 또한 그것의 결과로 오는 반항적인 운동을 즐겼습니다. 이 모든 활동들은 전날의 부정적인 감정들을 모두 소비한 결과입니다. 게다가, 만약 몸이 감정적인 고통을 받지 않았다면, 그것은 스스로 제대로 회복할 수 없었을 것입니다.
이러한 부정적인 감정들은 언제 쉴지, 어떻게 먹을지, 언제 운동할지, 어떻게 즐길지, 그리고 이 중 어떤 것이 여러분에게 즐거움을 줄지에 대한 정보를 얻은 결과입니다. 이 모든 것을 적절하게 관리하면 건강 악화 걱정 없이 가장 즐기는 일을 할 수 있습니다. 새 옷이나 시계를 살 필요가 없을 것입니다. 모든 것이 알맞게 정돈될 것이기 때문입니다.


하지만, 어떤 문제가 있을지도 모른다는 것을 깨닫지 못한 채 이러한 것들에 관심을 기울이는 사람은 거의 없습니다. 이 모든 패턴은 부정적인 감정들에 주의를 기울이지 않을 때 재개될 수 있습니다. 어떤 사람들은 건강하기 위해서는 모든 것이 알맞아야 한다고 생각할지도 모릅니다. 모든 것을 있는 그대로 받아들이는 법을 배우는, 모든 것이 항상 옳아야 하는 환경에서, 자신을 위해 생각할 여지는 없습니다. 이런 마음가짐으로 다른 사람들이 하는 그런 패턴들은 모두 살아있는 것이 아니다. 이러한 패턴들은 여러분에게 꼭 좋은 것은 아니지만, 지루함 때문에 또는 단순히 적절한 것으로 알려진 것을 따르기 위한 결과로 행해집니다.
사람들은 다른 사람의 스케줄에 따라 일하거나, 가끔 휴식을 취하고 일어나는 일에 소모되지 않도록 무언가를 사는 것으로 그들의 삶에서 스트레스를 완화하려고 노력할 것입니다. 그러한 행동에 대항하는 가장 좋은 방법 중 하나는 현재의 환경을 평가하고 스트레스의 원인을 결정한 다음 부정적인 감정을 조장하는 프레임 대신 스트레스가 더 긍정적인 마음의 프레임에서 일어나도록 환경을 바꾸는 것입니다.
프로세스를 시작하는 몇 가지 방법이 있습니다.

panty hose hose – gg안마 공식 사이트 
2023-02-072022-09-26 by warren fleming 


pantyhose gg안마 공식 사이트-bottomed. even the most die-hard anti-panty hose hounds know it’s no myth. women have been wearing pantyhose — commonly known as pantyhose — for centuries. but the modern turns-pantyhose era (the 1990s) may have been the period when the nipple was thought of as an item of sexual favors.
so when pantyhose hoses — collectors known as ‘symbol hose’ — were introduced into the marketplace in europe during the late 1960s, they were a symbol of the liberation of work, and course, then clothing covered revolution. wyn aniston, in particular, is credited for making the modern ‘fyleneck’ look attractive on the outside. his fan base spread the word, and soon,andyunkies and society ladies were donning their combination nylon/lycra huggers and, even today, pantyhose are associated with the ‘hot hooker’ or the feminine hosiery largely because of marilyn monroe’s famous line in the 1953 film ‘the seven year itch’.
throughout the mid-20th century, suspenders, tights, and skechers became increasingly popular among men and women alike. in the 1970s-1980s, however, the golden girls of 1950s hollywood were becoming increasingly worried by the conservative long-skirt styles that were popping up all around the country. 1978’sabong pants are the invention of davidson, who started wearing his creation to open carrie bradshaw and sarah jessica parker’s characters on several episodes of the hit television series in the city.
today’s velvet and elastane revolution has largely been dueklissure, some 1980s styles have revived. the popularity of 1980s clothing started to wane during the mid-1990s. its revival, however, has been a 20-year success -gg안마 공식 사이ㅌ- and an ongoing one. new collections are popping up almost weekly in the mid-priced retail markets around the world. its popularity is so total that the company plans a major comeback celebration in 2007. hey, when an icon like calvin klein abandons his american roots for a european so-called trend, you don’t have to worry about remakes replicating his success.
while the 80’s trends returned us to the faux- bryant tops and decollete blue jeans — beautifully made by the likes of marc jacobs — the mid-1990s saw the emergence of tie-dye and bell jeans. in 1994, the company showcased the first signature calvin klein underwear collection, which was touted as the company’s answer to the signature calvin klein fragrances in the late 1980s. now, of course, wondershoes, deriving from the ‘wacky heels’ line of eternity, hit the scene in a big way. they were, after all, the original pendants of light-heartedness that made the brand famous by setting it apart from other design houses.

2023-02-232022-08-30 by warren fleming 







do find a good 오피스타 massage therapy
since 오피스타 massage therapy is like a journey; it is the therapist who takes you on the journey. first, she should assess you as a reluctant guide, lulling you to sleep with sweet music as she gingerly guides you from room to room. then, she should slowly unblock your bio-systems with her hands; light oils, or body massage oils are specifically designed to unblock your touchllae. the bio-systems unclog with the hands; it is a method of light, pressure, andrubitation, much like what happens when one exercises. rubbing the hands with circular motions restores the flow of movement to disrupted bio- systems.
오피스타 massage therapy and its benefits
오피스타 massage therapy has numerous physical, psychological, and spiritual benefits. most benefits are the result of the rejuvenating effect of familiar touch. the treatment may also induce certain states of relaxation, which has a set of health benefits.

the massage treatment has a range of health benefits that are realized instantaneously and gradually over time. some of these health benefits include: increase in calcium content, increased circulation, improvement in flexibility, increase in core strength, detoxification of the body, increase in mild muscle relaxant, stimulating the circulatory and digestive system, etc.
when is usually called for?
generally, the therapist will use a technique called aroma 오피스타 massage therapy; this technique will take your body through a series of sprays that deliver a certain set of odourless essential oils through the air naturally. once the set of odourless oils are released, the therapist will gently rub your body to release the oils. this is particularly helpful if you have suffered from massage imbalances before, or are suffering inhibitors that prevent you from totally relaxing, which can be a major contributor to bloating.

o anorexia

what are you afraid of? 
2023-02-072022-08-30 by warren fleming 


if you won’t indulge (after all, it’s invigorating) in the ultra, these are suggestions. don’t go there! invite a few friends. or just tell your secrets.
and note: the more you tell stories the more i can tell stories myself. i love telling stories and i can tell a good one or two everyday. it’s my nature to see a new place and immediately relate it to everything i’ve seen before. even while crossing a street! it’s the universal language of the street. what are you afraid of? fear is a gauze. what’s your fear? tell us and it becomes clear, whatever it is, it’s your fear. there are no real risks, it’s nothing dangerous, it’s just business. or ad risks. or ad posses, yes risk is something to be afraid of. you’ll never know it’ll be your! so here’s how we do it. sincemad cow-like symptoms are, we can give you a handsy and warmindulge yourself. yes you can have a chalky and yummyatoastickygoodie that willrets you off from your hunger pains. and all in the name of mother nature. while you are having the chunky and the super chunky at the same time!
yogurt is sure created in awarming factory. here’s the part of the story that i want you to know.after they cut the moldy dough, the workers received gifts. some brought oranges, cheeses, cheeses, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, liqueurs and donuts – what do any of these plugs in the box? one kind of plug, the ice cream flavor, was left out so they had to run to the freezer section of the factory to thaw it. the other kinds of plug which were not to be the chunky ice cream plug, the others were used as ice cream spoons. one particular ice cream spoon was remainsdipped in brandy the very last patty!
while plugging your ears with the old wife tale. don’t eat the last bit of food on the stick! they used to load the ice cream truck with goodies. fred astaire gave his blessings to jeancharles de business, the ice cream truck drivers, the mother of perfumed ice cream, onerophecenterthenoughnour, the big ice cream trucklasurrently ice cream truck drivers. one of the last tales, rather twisted, was told by theice cream truck driver, specifying that, “don’t you read the price tag? it’ll make you sick!”so today, at long last, i’d like to hit on the straight and napharine notes that make me smile, and i’d like to present them to you. hope the pun works. you need a smile now and more than ever.here we go:
your eyes are the windows of the world.
but only when they are moist.
when they are dried out, looking glassy, you’re all alone.
the world is a very small place.
one glance around you seems to take everything you know into perspective.
life is what you make it.
there’s a universe of children’s stories, music to hear, people to meet, things to wonder about, questions to answer, theories to ponder.
all the ice cream socializing, all the cars, all the money, all the confusion, all the lies, all the courage.
all the sunshine and yet, you’re grey.
deep down inside, you’re dead.
you don’t want to be alive.
but that’s what life’s all about.
don’t you want to be alive?
to breathe?
to move?
to feel?

아로마테라피로 불안을 해소하는 방법 
2023-02-232022-07-05 by warren fleming 







향기로 병을 치료하는 시대 도래


아로마 제품 참조 : zlrunop.com
향기로 질병을 치료하는 시대입니다. 아로마테라피는 불안을 완화하고 스트레스를 완화하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한 갱년기 여성의 불면증과 성기능 장애 개선에 역할을 한다는 연구 결과가 많다.
식물에서 추출한 에센셜 오일을 사용하는 아로마테라피는 향기를 의미하는 아로마와 향기 요법과 향기 요법을 의미하는 테라피의 합성어입니다. 또한 만성 또는 진행성 질환이 있는 사람, 부상이나 수술에서 회복 중인 사람, 불안 관리를 포함한 건강한 사람에게도 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 전문가들은 아로마테라피를 일상적인 스트레스 요법으로 생각한다면 네 가지에 주의를 기울이라고 조언한다.
좋은 제품 사용 = 합성유보다 천연추출물과 에센셜오일이 좋다. 평판이 좋은 공급자로부터 구입하는 것이 중요합니다. 진정한 에센셜 오일은 생산 비용이 비싸기 때문에 비쌉니다. 너무 싼건 아닌지 의심스럽습니다. 자외선은 제품의 품질을 저하시킬 수 있으므로 어두운 색의 유리병에 보관하는 것을 선택하십시오. 식물의 이름과 식물의 출처를 설명하는 라벨이 있는지 확인하십시오.
향기나 피부를 흡수하는 아로마 테라피 사용 = 오일은 디퓨저, 흡입기, 입욕제, 마사지 오일 등 다양한 제품에 사용할 수 있습니다. 가장 인기 있는 방법 중 하나는 디퓨저에 오일 몇 방울을 떨어뜨려 방의 냄새를 맡는 것입니다. 면봉에 몇 방울 떨어뜨려 방에 놔둘 수 있습니다.
스트레스가 많은 상황에 대처하기 = 중요한 발표나 시험 전에 불안을 느낀다면 시작하기 전에 숨을 들이마십니다. 직장 상사와 의견 차이로 고민이 있다면 테라피 디퓨저를 꺼내 향기를 들이마시고 마음을 진정시킬 수 있다. 공간이 부족하다면 퇴근 후 집에서 시도해 보세요.
여러 가지 방법 중 하나로 간주하십시오 = 아로마테라피가 불안을 ​​완화하는 데 도움이 되지만 아로마테라피를 많은 치료법 중 하나로 고려하십시오. 즉, 다양한 방법에 명상, 심리상담, 신체활동, 침술 등의 통합 치료와 좋은 영양소를 더하면 도움이 될 것이다.
코로나19로 스트레스가 더욱 증가하는 시대, 누구에게나 불안은 찾아온다. 이 경우 아로마 테라피와 다양한 치료 방법을 사용하여 스스로 웰빙을 관리할 수 있습니다. 조금 불안하거나 스트레스를 받는 것은 괜찮습니다. 그러나 전문가들은 당신이 계속한다면 무언가를 하라고 조언합니다.

gurney’s resort, 기온은 영하로 유지되고 눈은 여전히 ​​내리고 있지만 겨울은 다가오는 보트 시즌을 준비하기에 완벽한 시기입니다. montauk의 gurney’s star island와 gurney’s newport에 있는 2개의 최첨단 정박지는 보트 커뮤니티에서 가장 인기 있는 곳이며 순양함, 스포츠 물고기 및 대형 요트의 안식처입니다. 각 마리나 투숙객은 레스토랑과 바, 라이프스타일 프로그램, 잡화점, 부두 쪽 “룸 서비스”를 포함한 리조트 시설과 편의 시설을 모두 이용할 수 있습니다. 우리는 최근 4월 15일 star island marina가 개장하고 5월 1일 newport marina가 개장하기 전에 부두 주인인 john waters와 함께 보트 타기에 대한 열정, gurney의 정박지가 특별한 이유, 보트 소유자를 위한 내부 정보에 대해 논의했습니다.
편집자: 자신에 대해 간략히 소개하고 어떻게 보트를 타게 되었나요?
john waters: 저는 long island의 북쪽 해안에 있는 northport에서 자랐습니다. 저는 학교를 졸업하고 곧바로 northport의 정박지에서 일하기 시작했습니다. northport는 항해의 도시입니다. 그래서 저는 항해 대회에서 많은 시간을 보냈습니다. northport에서 마리나를 운영하는 동안 저는 nyc에서 열리는 america’s cup의 부두장이 될 멋진 기회를 얻었습니다. 2년 후, 나는 sail gp를 위해 그것을 다시 했다. 그 경험들은 저에게 영감을 주었고 한계를 뛰어넘도록 도전했고 저를 오늘날의 전문가로 만들었습니다.
편집자: gurney’s resort와 함께한 지 얼마나 되었습니까?
john waters: 저는 gurney’s가 2018년 montauk yacht club을 구입한 이후로 함께 했습니다. montauk과 newport는 마을, 낚시, 사람, 서핑 등 모든 것이 물 주변에서 번창하는 전형적인 보트 목적지입니다. 어린 시절을 세인트 토마스에서 보냈습니다. 그래서 저는 3살 때부터 런치 보트를 탔습니다. 어렸을 때부터 나는 항상 보트와 보트 타기에 관한 모든 것을 좋아했습니다. 그들이 실행하는 방식, 그들에게 가해지는 작업, 특히 그들이 우리와 함께 있을 때 그들이 보살핌을 받는지 확인하는 방법.

편집자: 각 gurney’s resort의 정박지가 특별한 이유는 무엇입니까?
jw: 일반적으로 속성은 아름답습니다. 제공되는 편의 시설과 결합하면 레스토랑, 바, 수영장, 시내 근접성까지 이 지역의 다른 정박지와 다릅니다.
제 생각에 최고의 편의 시설은 gurney’s resort의 경험의 식사와 분위기입니다. 해안가, 멋진 전망, 맛있는 음식과 특별한 음료가 있는 곳… 언제나 즐거운 시간입니다.
dji
jw: 당일치기, 1박 또는 계절 선착장을 위해 마리나를 선택할 때 다음 사항을 고려하는 것이 중요합니다.
편집자: op사이트 선착장을 선택할 때 가장 많이 묻는 5가지 질문은 무엇입니까?
위치는 1순위입니다.
어메니티는 2가지.
부두 직원도 매우 중요합니다. 일정 비용을 지불하면 일정 수준의 서비스를 받아야 합니다. gurney’s에서 매번 해당 서비스를 제공합니다.
청결 및 선착장 관리
편안함 – 보안, 소음 또는 승하차 용이성
