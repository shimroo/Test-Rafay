welcome 



the national center for pyramid model innovations (ncpmi) works to improve state and local capacity to implement, scale-up, and sustain effective practices and policies to equitably support the social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes of young children with, and at risk for, developmental delays or disabilities. ncpmi assists states and programs in developing sustainable systems for the equitable implementation of the pyramid model for promoting social-emotional competence in infants and young children (pyramid model) within early intervention and early education programs. we do this with a focus on: improving the social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes of young children birth to five; eliminating the use of inappropriate and disproportionate exclusionary discipline practices; promoting family engagement; using data for decision-making; increasing the use of trauma-informed and culturally and linguistically responsive practices; and fostering inclusion.
