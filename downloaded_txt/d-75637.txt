join the missionbuild with usas st. francis heard the lord’s speaking to him from the san damiano crucifix, “st. francis, rebuild my house,” francis had two immediate convictions: he knew that god had a mission for him and that he would need help to accomplish it. so, he began to beg for donations from his neighbors and companions.the friars share this two-fold conviction.  we know that we have received a mission from the lord to participate in his work of renewal and rebuilding. like st. francis, we know we can’t do it alone. we’re dependent on the support and generosity of god’s people.
