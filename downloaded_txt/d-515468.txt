 frequently asked questions
answers to some of the most common personal injury questions we’re asked.

 do i always need a personal injury lawyer?
if you have sustained a personal injury through an unlawful act, you should contact a personal injury lawyer. an experienced personal injury attorney can examine the facts of your case, go over your rights and alternatives, and represent you at hearings and in court. personal injury cases can become quite complex. there are countless factors that a plaintiff will need to establish, which will require collecting specific evidence from a combination of different sources like professionals and law enforcement. therefore, the best way to prepare for a solid personal injury case is to hire a personal injury attorney.
how long do i have to file a personal injury lawsuit in illinois?
the illinois personal injury statute of limitations places a rigid time restriction on your privilege to ask a court for payment for your losses arising from an accident.
suppose you have a claim stemming from an auto accident, a slip and fall, or another accident where another person’s negligent (or intentional) behavior caused you harm. in that case, you may consider filing a personal injury lawsuit in illinois civil court. if so, it’s essential to comprehend and comply with the statute of limitations for these types of claims.
two years is the legal time limit for personal injury claims in illinois. after another individual’s negligence causes you harm, and you want to ask the court for a remedy, you have two years to file a complaint and any other necessary paperwork with the court. the time limit begins on the day of the accident or incident that caused the injuries.
the two-year time limit applies to almost all possible personal injury claims.
how can i afford to hire an injury attorney?
after being hurt by the negligence of someone else, the goal most individuals have is to recover physically. nevertheless, it may be impossible to completely recover without paying costly medical bills or losing cash through missed time at work.
it doesn’t seem reasonable that the injured person should be accountable for using their money to be made whole again. many personal injury lawyers help injured individuals recover their losses from the party at fault without spending any money themselves.
this model is called a contingency fee. this kind of fee structure is where an attorney agrees to take a case and front the client their fees and expenses. making this deal more attractive, the client will not owe the attorney any money unless the client’s case is victorious under many of these agreements.

 will my injury case go to trial?
personal injury claims go through several significant steps during the lawsuit process. these may differ with each case, but most lawsuits involve actions such as:

filing: after the injury incident, the victim may start legal action by filing with the court
discovery: this is where the parties exchange essential documents that will be used in the upcoming trial
arguments: this is where the parties present their legal arguments using evidence to support their claims. they may also examine witnesses to make their points.
judgment: upon consideration of the evidence and arguments, the court will issue the judgment, which may include monetary damages and other remedies
appeals: if needed, the parties may appeal the legal issues in dispute. factual disputes are typically not appealed.

several other elements can change the course and direction of a personal injury lawsuit. one example is when one party decides to offer a settlement early in the trial. this can have the effect of shortening the overall trial. in some cases, settlement can happen even before the trial occurs, eliminating the parties’ need to undergo litigation.
other factors can prolong the lawsuit process. for example, if there is a dispute over a legal matter, a re-trial or an appeal may sometimes result. this can cause the process to be extended longer than usual.
