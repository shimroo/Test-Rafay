										- blogging 

in modern building construction, as two common concrete production equipment, self feeding mixer truck and concrete tank mixing truck play an importance role.
although they are designed to meet the needs of concrete construction, there are significant differences in structure, function, working principle and application scenarios. this article will introduce the difference between the self-feeding mixer and the concrete mixing tank in detail to help readers better understand and choose the construction equipment suitable for their own.

structural differences




self-feeding mixer truck

self-feeding mixer is a kind of multi-functional concrete production equipment which integrates the functions of mixing, transporting and feeding.its structural design is unique and usually includes a rotating mixing cylinder, an automatic feeding system, a power system and key components such as the cab. the mixing drum is used for mixing and storage of concrete, the automatic feeding system is responsible for automatically feeding raw materials such as aggregate and cement into the mixing drum, and the power system provides the power required for mixing and feeding.

concrete mixing tank truck

concrete mixing tank truck, also known as concrete mixing transport truck, is mainly used for concrete mixing and transportation. it is usually composed of chassis, mixing cylinder, inlet and outlet device, transmission system, hydraulic system and other parts. the mixing drum is the core component of the equipment, which is used for mixing and transporting concrete. the loading and unloading device is responsible for the concrete and the transmission system and hydraulic system work together to drive the rotation of the mixing cylinder.
functional differences




self feeding mixer truck

the biggest feature of the self loading mixer is that it integrates mixing, transportation and feeding functions, which can realize the integration of on-site mixing, automatic feeding and transportation. it is suitable for various construction sites, especially those requiring frequent movement and on-site mixing of concrete. self-feeding mixer can greatly save manpower and time, improve construction efficiency and quality.

concrete mixing tank truck

concrete mixing tankers focus on mixing and transporting concrete. it is usually used in conjunction with the concrete mixing station, the concrete produced by the mixing station is loaded into the mixing tank, and then transported to the construction site for unloading. the mixing tank can maintain the uniformity of the concrete during transportation and prevent the layering and segregation of the concrete.
differences in working principles




self-feeding mixer truck

the working principle of the self-feeding mixer is relatively complex. it first through the automatic feeding system to aggregate, cement and other raw materials into the mixing cylinder, and then use the rotation of the mixing cylinder for concrete mixing. after mixing is completed, the vehicle can be transported to the construction site for unloading. in the whole process, the automatic feeding system and the rotation of the mixing cylinder are dependent on the drive of the power system.

concrete mixing tank truck

the working principle of the concrete mixing tank truck is relatively simple. it uses the rotation of the mixing drum to maintain the uniformity of the concrete and prevent the concrete from being stratified and separated during transportation. when the mixing tank truck arrives at the construction site, the concrete is unloaded to the designated position through the inlet and outlet device. throughout the process, the rotation of the mixing drum depends on the collaborative work of the transmission system and the hydraulic system.
differences in application scenarios

in concrete mixing plants, the hopper lifting system plays a crucial role as a key component. the system is mainly responsible for lifting raw materials from the ground or low position to the mixing machine, ensuring the continuity and efficiency of the production process. this article will focus on introducing the main functions, components, and maintenance methods of the hopper elevator in the hopper type concrete mixing plant.

1main functionsthe hopper elevator is responsible for the important task of vertical transportation of raw materials in the concrete mixing plant. it can lift raw materials such as sand, stone, cement, etc. from the storage bin or ground to the top of the mixing machine, and then feed the raw materials into the mixing machine through the dumping action of the hopper. the implementation of this process not only improves production efficiency, but also reduces the labor intensity of workers, making the production of concrete mixing plants more automated and intelligent.
2componentsthe hopper elevator mainly consists of the following parts:

motor and reducer

provide the power required for the hoist and adjust the motor speed to the appropriate range through the reducer to meet the operational requirements of the hoist.

drum

driven by an electric motor, the steel wire rope or chain on the drum rotates to drive the lifting of the hopper.

wire rope or chain

as a transmission medium, it connects the drum and hopper to ensure smooth lifting of the hopper.

hopper

used to load raw materials and maintain their stability during the lifting process.

guide rail and pulley

provide a lifting track for the hopper to ensure its stability and safety during the lifting process.
3maintenance methodsin order to ensure the normal operation of the hopper elevator and extend its service life, regular maintenance and upkeep are required. the specific methods are as follows:

regularly check the operation status of motors, reducers, and other equipment to ensure their normal operation without any abnormal sounds or overheating.
check the wear of the steel wire rope or chain. if there is any breakage, deformation, or excessive wear, it should be replaced in a timely manner.
clean the residue inside the hopper to avoid affecting the normal operation of the hoist.
regularly lubricate the lubrication parts of the hoist to ensure smooth operation.
check the wear of the guide rail and pulley. if there is severe wear or deformation, it should be repaired or replaced in a timely manner.

also other types of concrete batching plant machinery are all available on ltconcreteplant.com.
in summary, the lifting system of the concrete mixing plant hopper is an important link in the production process, and its normal operation has a significant impact on the production efficiency and quality of the entire mixing plant. therefore, we need to fully understand its main functions, components, and maintenance methods to ensure its optimal performance in the production process.








application of warm mix asphalt in municipal road construction

warm mix asphalt technology is a truly low-carbon paving technology with high energy saving and low emissions. it can reduce the construction temperature by 40 to 60 degrees celsius while maintaining good performance of the asphalt mixture, effectively alleviating the environmental problems caused by the hot mix asphalt mixture process.


1. control of mixing temperature of warm mix asphalt
during municipal road construction, compared with traditional hot mix asphalt mixture, the construction temperature of warm mix asphalt mixture has been effectively reduced. for the mixing of warm mix asphalt mixture, when adding mineral powder and warm mix additives, part of the hot material will be lost to a certain extent. therefore, the aggregate heating temperature should be set slightly higher than the discharging temperature. in addition, according to the actual construction conditions, the temperature of the warm mix asphalt  discharging should be adjusted, and the construction personnel should strictly control the mixing temperature to meet the construction requirements.
2. transportation of warm mix asphalt
when transporting the warm mix asphalt by trucks, insulation measures should be taken, especially in winter. due to the low temperature, the temperature of the asphalt mixture decreases quickly, which requires relevant personnel should insulate the transport vehicles. foam partitions can be installed on the sides of the transport vehicles, which can effectively reduce the temperature drop of the asphalt mixture during transportation. in addition, a digital display plug-in thermocouple thermometer can be used to detect the temperature of the asphalt mixture when it leaves the factory and when it is transported to the construction site.
3. paving of warm mix asphalt mixture
when paving warm mix asphalt, the penetrating layer oil and sticky layer oil should be spread on the asphalt surface layer, and it should be ensured that the spread sticky layer oil has enough time to evaporate. when construction is carried out in low-temperature seasons, paving should not be carried out when the temperature is below zero and the road surface is wet. if the road surface freezes, it will have a greater impact on the bonding between layers, thus reducing the service life of the road surface.


4. rolling of warm mix asphalt mixture
when carrying out rolling construction of warm mix asphalt mixture, the appropriate rolling method should be selected in accordance with the requirements of construction-related specifications. in order to improve the smoothness and compaction of the road, if the asphalt does not move or crack during initial compaction, the rolling operation should be carried out at a high temperature after paving. when a steel wheel roller is used for water sprinkling, its humidity should meet the standard requirements of construction and no more flowing water is allowed to be produced. when using rubber tire rollers for painting, a broom equipped with vegetable oil should be used to improve the quality of the rolling construction. find more asphalt plant to visit ltasphaltplant.com.

types and choice of stationary concrete pump


					on january 29, 2023					by oscar james					with					0 comments
										- blogging 

efficient stationary concrete pump machines have been concerned by most of construction parties. in order to shorten the project period and get more profit, many construction units want to buy an ideal concrete pumping machine. but there are so many types of stationary concrete pumps. what’s the difference between them? how should we choose the most suitable one?


first of all, we should know the types of stationary concrete pump and the different characteristics.
1.concrete ground pump
concrete ground pump is also called concrete trailer pump. this kind of pump without chassis can not walk alone so it is a kind of stationary concrete pump. but usually it is equipped with tires to facilitate traction by trailers. concrete ground pump is the most common pumping equipment on construction sites, which is specially used for concrete conveying and pouring tasks.
concrete ground pump is divided into large concrete pump for construction projects (60m3/h pump, 80m3/h pump, 90 m3/h pump, etc.), small concrete pump for conveying big aggregate in small rural house building construction (40~60 m3/h pump), as well as fine stone concrete pump and mortar pump.
2.concrete mixer pump
compared with concrete ground pump, concrete mixer pump combines concrete loading, conveying, mixing and pumping functions together. this kind of stationary concrete pump is a type of multiple concrete pump machine. like concrete trailer pump, concrete mixer pump is installed on a frame with tires, but it cannot walk alone. 
but some of concrete mixer pumps are installed on a truck chassis, called truck-mounted concrete pump, which can walk alone, also known as mobile concrete pumps. if you want to mixer concrete on site and improve your project speed, concrete mixer pump is a good choice.
although stationary concrete pump is not good as mobile concrete pump at mobility, it is more economical and practical, the product performance is stable and reliable, the maintenance operation is simpler. due to the tire setting, it can also be freely moved on construction sites by trailer. 
in the concrete pumping machinery with their own characteristics and advantages, stationary concrete pumps have been widely recognized by many project construction parties and investors.
after understanding the types of stationary concrete pump, the next step is how to choose the ideal model.
to choose a suitable stationary concrete pump model is not an easy thine. choose a right pump can twice the result with half effort. but if the choice is wrong, there may be some unexpected conditions. so the following aspects should be considered when selecting the delivery concrete pump:
1.concrete pouring requirements
the selection of stationary concrete pumps should be considered according to the concrete engineering object, characteristics, the required maximum conveying distance, concrete construction plan, concrete pump form and specific conditions, etc.
2.type and structure of the building
the performance of stationary concrete pump varies from machine models. apart from the amount of concrete pouring, the type of building and structure, construction technical requirements, site conditions and surrounding environment should also be considered. the main performance parameters of concrete ground pump should be consistent with the construction needs or slightly large. if the capacity is too large, the utilization rate is low; if it is too small, the machine not only can not meet the construction requirements, the loss of concrete pump will also be accelerated.
3.construction business volume
the number of concrete ground pump can be calculated according to the concrete pouring amount, the actual conveying quantity of the single machine and the construction operation time. for those large amount of one-time concrete pouring in concrete pumping projects, besides the calculation, there should be a certain amount of reserve.
4.product configuration
the product performance of static concrete pump should adhere to a high starting point when selection. if the high value stationary pump is selected, the standard requirements for its products must also be improved. the quality of the main components of the products, from the internal quality to the appearance quality should adapt to the high value of the fixed pump.
now, you know the key points of choosing your ideal pump machine. hope you get your it soon!
