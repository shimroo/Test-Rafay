ul greenguard certification

ul greenguard certification helps demonstrate compliance with chemical emission standards and your commitment to healthier indoor environments.

ul greenguard certification















the majority of everyday chemical exposure in people occurs through the air we breathe in our homes, offices, schools and other indoor environments. these airborne chemicals are commonly referred to as volatile organic compounds (vocs) and are used to manufacture and maintain building materials, interior furnishing, cleaning products and personal care products. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and various researchers have conducted studies that reveal two key findings:

vocs are common in indoor environments.
their levels indoors may be between two and 1,000 times higher than outdoors.

there may be anywhere from 50 to hundreds of individual vocs circulating through indoor air at any time. some may produce objectionable odors if the concentration of vocs is at low levels, but many have no noticeable smell. many vocs are irritants and can cause headaches; eye, nose and throat irritation; and dizziness. long-term exposure to certain vocs may lead to chronic diseases including cancer. the products used to build and furnish our indoor environments can have a significant impact on indoor air pollution levels.
our ul greenguard certification program has established test methods and emission limits for a variety of product groups, including: 


vehicles


furniture


flooring


building materials


 




electronic equipment


interiors


cleaning products


 


 


you can choose from two tiers of certification: ul greenguard certification and ul greenguard gold certification.
standard ul greenguard certification
the epa and the state of washington initially used ul greenguard certification emissions limits as purchasing specifications for furniture and commercial building products. ul greenguard certification criteria have served as the basis for the leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) credit for low-emitting furniture since 2002. office furniture products that are ul greenguard certified also comply with the business and institutional furniture manufacturer’s association (bifma) x7.1 standard.
ul greenguard gold certification
the ul greenguard gold certification standard includes health-based criteria for additional chemicals and requires lower total voc emissions levels to ensure that products are acceptable for use in environments such as schools and healthcare facilities. in addition to limiting emissions of more than 360 vocs and total chemical emissions, ul greenguard gold certified products must also comply with the requirements of the california department of public health (cdph) standard method for the testing and evaluation of volatile organic chemical emissions from indoor sources using environmental chambers, also known as california section 01350.
all certified products are subject to a review of the manufacturing process and routine testing to demonstrate minimal impact on the indoor environment in the long period.












voc testing creates peace of mind for customers and consumers


more than ever, consumers want products that contribute to healthy environments and don’t have hidden impacts on health. as people reflect on their indoor environments, indoor air quality (iaq) represents a growing concern.
retailers and brands are seeking ul greenguard certified products to appeal to health- and environment-conscious consumers and gain market share in the u.s. and globally.
the ul greenguard certification mark communicates that representative samples of a product have undergone rigorous scientific testing to meet stringent chemical emissions requirements. this certification gives retailers and manufacturers a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace, demonstrating their commitment to people and the environment.










show commitment to more sustainable buildings and materials


ul greenguard certification helps manufacturers make and market products with low chemical emissions that contribute to healthier indoor air. more than 450 federal purchasers, retailers, green building rating tools and building codes around the world recognize, refer to and prefer ul greenguard certified products.
numerous building programs, standards and specifications worldwide recognize and refer to the ul greenguard certification program. products with ul greenguard certification or ul greenguard gold certification can contribute to achieving points in established green building rating systems such as leed, building research establishment environmental assessment method (breeam), fitwel and others; satisfy code or ordinance criteria; and meet iaq-specific request for proposal (rfp) requirements.














the benefits of ul greenguard certification
as a global safety science leader, ul solutions applies our recognized expertise in iaq by empowering retailers and product manufacturers to demonstrate that their products are healthier because they emit low chemical emissions. that helps them show their commitment to health and sustainability and gain a competitive advantage.

ul solutions is a globally recognized leader in iaq.
we certify products for low chemical emissions based on rigorous scientific standards.
greenguard gold certified means products are built to contribute to safer, healthier air.
greenguard gold certified products are low-emitting and contribute to cleaner indoor air for you and your family.
certified products are screened for more than 15,000 vocs known to pollute indoor air.
