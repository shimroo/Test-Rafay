interested in 
    advertising?
our advertisers are shooterspages 
    sponsors and are appreciated by the shooting community.
    contact shooterspages@gmail.com 
    regarding banners.
enjoy traveling around the country?

    include a trip to one of the many wonderful venues on this website
    which offer the shooting sports.

    pick a state, any state, and click on any of the club names to be brought to 
    their websites. there you'll find contact information and info to determine 
    if a trip to the club will enhance your vacation.

    shotgun sports include the friendliest people
    who are willing to help the beginner no matter how new your are to the 
    sport.
    you'll find, safety first is always the priority.
looking for some 
    friendly competition?
check out your 
    state's calendar.
find the clubs near you and 
    join in on any of the nsca or unregistered shoots
    available throughout the year. all welcome beginners.
    since safety first is always the priority, let the club know your 
    limitations and they will set you up with an instruction or a group who will 
    mentor you.
    we love bringing new people into the sport, so don't be shy about being a 
    beginner. we all started that way!
have 
    questions for the community?
click:
forums home page
    
; go to the general forum. 
    you'll need to have an account to create a new 
    topic or to reply to a topic. you don't need a 
    login to read the postings, but if you want to ask 
    questions and participate, go to the top of the forums page and you'll find 
    a link to click to get a user name and password. only takes a few minutes.
    
    once done, you are logged in.
are you a club/range 
    holding shooting events?
are you a club/range and want a log in? 
    email

shooterspages@gmail.com
all nsca events are automatically 
    listed on the calendars.
    unregistered (non nsca) events are very much welcomed on the calendars.
    these unregistered events are often a welcomed, more relaxing event for the 
    nsca participants. add your unregistered shoots here and you will probably 
    get an increase in participation.
    we find that many people who start out, attend unregistered shoots first.
    
    after one or two events, they are 'hooked' and 
    want to join in on the fun of nsca shoots. 
it's all fun!
 
do you want to add a shoot to the calendar
    or add links to an existing event?
(note: if 
    event is a clinic, lesson, etc. the fee is $12.50 to list. contact:
    shooterspages@gmail.com with 
    details if you want to add these types of events)

sporting clays events listed 
    for free!
i'll be happy to add the event 
    listing to the calendar or edit the event.
    please email 
    shooterspages@gmail.com
and include the following info.

    (sporting clays, fitasc, 5-stand)  
    state:
    date:
    club/range name where held:
    city:
    shoot name:
    nsca event (yes) or (no):
    info link:  http://???? ;  


    the above is listed for free! if you have a file/attachment, and if i 
    publish the file, there is a $35 fee. there are many ways to avoid the 
    fee by publishing it yourself so you can use link(s).
    here are a few possibilities:
    - you can have the club publish it
    - you can use dropbox or google docs (both free services) to publish a flyer 
    if it is a word document or a pdf file. once published and choosing to make 
    it available to the public, you may send me the link and i'll be happy to 
    link to it from the calendar listing.   
    - you can make a forum post by adding a new topic on the  shooterspages.com 
    general forum. type in all the info you'd like about the shoot. you'll have 
    the capability to add a graphic (flyer or map, etc.) in the posting if you 
    so choose. you may even come back to the posting and edit it at a later 
    time. once i see the posting, i will link to it for free. the navigation 
    link to get to all  http://shooterspages.com forums is near the top of all 
    pages. as with any forum, to make a post or reply to a post or edit your own 
    post, you'll need to have an account (login and password) and be logged in. 
    if you don't already have one, go to the forums and at the very top you'll 
    see a way to log in and a way to get an account (login and password).

our 
      intention, with the 
      shooterspages.com website, is to promote the 
      shooting sports.



shooterspages has partnered with iclays to produce 
      accurate and detailed information for all.
      we do not require a club to use iclays, all registration/scores reporting 
      methods can be linked at the event. 
      you can even copy/paste your shoot info or scores into a forum post!
      as long as there is a published web address (url) we can link to it!copyright ©
