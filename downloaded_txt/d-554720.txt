difference shouldn’t be tolerated—it should be celebrated.
















the new normal.



orchard friends is a small, private special education school in riverton, new jersey. we teach k-12 students who struggle to learn in other educational environments. we also offer college prep, vocational programming, and other transitional resources for 18–21-year-old students. when others close their doors, we open ours. here, students and their families are not simply accepted—they are welcomed and wanted, integral parts of our school family. we believe that true success is always individual — defined from the inside, out. our role is to support and prepare our students to take the next right step for them—not to conform to external expectations. we offer an entirely different model for education that works for students across a wide range of strengths, challenges, ages, and goals. to learn more about our flexible, individualized approach, visit our approach page. 



take your next right step.

defying definition.



at orchard friends, difference is our common ground. we believe that success isn’t standardized; that a diagnosis isn’t a definition; and that that there is no one right way to learn, to live, and to be. we recognize neurodivergence as naturally occurring variations to be celebrated and supported—not deficits to be cured. we understand that each of us learns differently because each of us is different. in our strengths, and our struggles. in our challenges and capabilities. in our past experiences, and our dreams for the future. orchard friends exists to enable learning and empower learners. we believe that all students have the ability, capacity, and fundamental right to learn. we ensure they have the resources, support, and safety they need to make learning possible. we’re not a place where students come to stop. we’re where they come to begin.

“our goal is to get them back—to help our students until they can help themselves. to believe in them until they believe in themselves. we wrap ourselves around them until they can do it on their own. ultimately, we teach them how to manage challenges; develop capabilities; to see that, with the right tools, support, and learning environment, learning is possible—for everyone.”— beth diperna, head of school

sophia’s story



i’d almost given up hope. we’d researched so many possible schools, and all of them were too far, too expensive, or just wrong for my daughter, sophia. after one prospective school visit, i burst into tears. all i could think was, “that’s not my child.”then we discovered orchard friends, and everything changed. after meeting with beth, i knew this was the right school for sophia. the faculty and staff were amazing! they worked intensively with sophia using a hands-on, multisensory approach.  her progress is a tribute to their expertise, personalized support, and dedication. four years after orchard, sophia is thriving, excelling in sports, art and interior design. she has her whole future planned out! she’s gone from believing that something was wrong with her to believing in who she is and all that she can achieve. she’s gained confidence and skills, and grown tremendously in her relationships with others. she has dreams, focus, and direction. to know where sophia came from, and then to see where she is and who she’s become today—it’s just amazing.”



graduation is only the beginning. visit our students page to learn more.
