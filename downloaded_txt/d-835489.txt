introduction
in this global pandemic that warrants the participation of all members of society for containment, and where inequalities become starkly evident and pose greater risks to the vulnerable, engaging families and children is imperative. early childhood development services can be a cost-effective and sustainable way to empower families and communities to interrupt cycles of poverty and violence, as well as build resilience and social cohesion.

"in a real sense, all life is inter-related. all persons are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be, and you can never be what you ought to be until i am what i ought to be. this is the inter-related structure of reality. " 
 - martin luther king, jr. (1929–1968)
