what 
                            we're working on
here's 
                            what we have planned so far for 2026. since these 
                            trips are not yet finalized, including the price, 
                            if you decide to put down a deposit to lock in your 
                            spot we will refund it in full once it's finalized 
                            if you don't like the final offering.

                            sure, we have our current greece trip coming up september 
                            29th however we couldn't accommodate everyone who 
                            wanted to go and the wait list was very long. this 
                            will be a repeat of the same trip. read

                            of portual
april 
                            29th - may 10th, 2026
                            we've been to portual several times now and have visited 
                            a good deal of it. this trip will feature just 2-nights 
                            in lisbon, 4-nights on the island of madeira and then 
                            4-nights in porto. we have not yet run a group to 
                            madeira, part of the azores, however i have been there 
                            and can say confidently that you will love it. the 
                            jeep tour we took was phenomenal especially and covered 
                            so much beauty. porto is also amazing. we had one 
                            group trip there and everyone was blown away with 
                            the setting and great tours. you can see what we've 
                            done on our past trips to portugal keeping in mind 
                            that this trip is not yet finalized. read

ireland 
                            and scotland
may 
                            13th - 24th, 2026
                            in the past we've also had iceland as part of this 
                            itinerary and it was a 2-week trip. this time around 
                            we're skipping iceland in favor of a more relaxed 
                            trip with 5-nights in ireland and 5-nights in scotland. 
                            you can see what we've done on our past trips on this 
                            itinerary keeping in mind that the trip is not yet 
                            finalized. read
