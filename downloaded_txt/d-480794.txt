first aid academy is a specialist organisation approved to run first aid courses that fullfil health and safety at work regulations. first aid academy works with an ofqual-approved awarding body and the first aid industry body (faib) to deliver nationally recognised health and safety executive courses, outdoor/mountain first aid, sports first aid, and advanced first aid courses.

with the withdrawal of the health and safety executive from the approval of first aid training, we feel it is in our client’s best interest to have an accredited award. therefore, we shall deliver all first aid at work, emergency first aid at work, paediatric first aid and outdoor first aid qualifications through our ofqual approved awarding body qnuk ltd. or the first aid industry body


using an ofqual awarding organisation we will offer quality training at an affordable price. the awarding organisation and the faib have completed all due diligence checks, ensuring course content and assessment are of a high standard.


in england, wales, and northern ireland, these courses are accredited by ofqual and listed on the rqf (registered qualifications framework). all our courses include training on the safe use of an automated external defibrillator (aed) in treating a sudden cardiac arrest. our courses follow the standard mnemonic drabcde or drcabcde.
