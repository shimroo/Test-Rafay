    tons of information.

we will still offer 
    all of our ever expanding index/glossary pages

about the publishers 
    of japanese woodblock prints... and so much more.

this picture of frank is frank being frank. 

his 
    picture was used from january 1 to april 30, 2018.  

normally i would take frank's 
    picture down by now,

but i just love it too much to do a 
    thing like that.


 


    
 
 



 


the wallpaper on this page is 
    from a

photo taken at the nitobe 
    memorial garden

at the university of british 
    columbia, vancouver, 

b.c. it was shot by my good 
    friend, evan black,  

in late april, 2012. he says it 
    was the 

camera, but i say it is the 
    user.
