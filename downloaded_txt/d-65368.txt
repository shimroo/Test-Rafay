anybody reading this page who doesn't already have more than enough photon led lights may be very, very 
									slightly interested to learn that, this week only, everything in 
									the photon store is 15% off, if you use the coupon code "spring15off".
(as usual, i get a cut if you follow my link and then buy something.)

i have avoided pestering readers of this page with announcements of the last couple of
									photon-light sales. this one's quite 
									nice, though.
for the duration of the us fourth of july weekend, they've taken 15% off everything in 
									the store, including a bunch of oddments that you might not expect people famous for 
									high-quality key-ring flashlights. they sell excellent-quality maha nimh batteries and 
									chargers, some leatherman tools and, as they say, more.
use the coupon code "fireworks" at checkout to get your discount. and, as usual, i get a 
									cut if you click my link to the site and 
									then buy something.

herewith, a product of considerable interest to australians 
									and virtually none to everyone else:


the noontec v9-t, a neat little networked dual-tuner pvr and 
									media player of exactly the sort that big media companies want to sue you for owning.
(note that this device is pointless for non-australians because its tv tuners only work 
									with our, unique, free-to-air
									digital tv 
									system.)

another photon-light sale!
the us dollar's in
									
									pretty

									lousy

									shape at the moment, so this could be a good time for people outside the usa to buy some stuff 
									from the photon factory outlet.
the current "october pre-holiday sale" takes 15% off all photon lights, maha batteries and 
									chargers, and leatherman multi-tools, which they now also sell for some reason.
the 15% discount also applies to their expensive
									but
good variable-brightness 
									"photon pro" one-aa-cell light, which has been upgraded with a significantly brighter high-power 
									white led, in addition to its little red led for when you don't want to lose your night vision.
and, as usual, i get a cut of the action if you
									click here and buy something!15 september

in the unlikely case that you have not yet bought quite enough
									photon lights, they've got another sale 
									running now. the list prices for various of their products have been reduced a bit now, 
									and there's a "march madness" sale running on top of that, until the end of the month
as usual, i get a cut of the action if you
									click here and buy something.
