scam alert: do not buy gift cards for rev anne!many people have received e-mails looking like they were from rev anne asking people to buy gift cards. this is an elaborate hoax.do not respond and report the sender's e-mail address to your e-mail provider. the perpetrator of the hoax copied information from publicly available sources and created an email that looks like it is from anne thatcher. it is not. rev. anne will ask for pledges to st. peter's, but not gift cards. this ploy has been used on clergy throughout the country by pulling information from church websites.if you have questions about the authenticity of an email from rev. anne, call wendy in the parish office at 973-538-0555 ext 114 or forward the email to her. be aware that scammers can almost perfectly mimic email addresses; no matter how convincing it looks, no email from rev. anne asking for gift cards is going to be legitimate.
