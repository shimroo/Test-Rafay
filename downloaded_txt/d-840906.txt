â¦ itâs hard to believe neuman has lived to tell it, ... and even 
	remained saneâ¦
	~ writerâs digest, life stories judge
my dear mother pushed me into this world at the worst time, and the worst 
	place, in the history of mankind: ground zero of world war ii in germany.
not long thereafter, this baby was slowly rotting to death.
	
	quite literally! by order of a
	
	socialist government!
for a long time i regretted that dr. heinemann saved my life during my final hours. not too long 
	thereafter, other doctors and nurses saved my 
	life again for a second time and a third time!
my horrors continued for many more years without a hiatus. in the 
	meantime, god was 
	protecting and guiding me through those nightmarish years and has always 
	done so. it was not until into my late sixties that i slowly realized that i was 
	on a path to blossom into an overcomer of everything.  and without, 
	and even in spite of, other people.
i was unknowingly gaining some of the most useful wisdom and 
	certainties that can only come 
	from near-death (nde) and tortured-life experiences. i wanted to discover if and how such might have affected me 
	personally. i received a shock of happiness and 
	self-satisfaction soon after i began reading
	
	the 
	web page of the
	international association of near-death studies, inc. i quickly joined 
	as a paying member.
	the research results and testimonies of that global organization vindicates 
	many of my premonitions, foresights, insights, prophecies, empathetic 
	nature, etc., in other words, i am now vindicated of what most others 
	thought to be  "weird" at best. however, the real best of all for all 
	human beings is that
	
	"the self does not die."

after my wife and i bailed out of the rats' 
		race, we donated the land, the plants, and 
	our labor, for this quarter-acre public park (partial view). 
		during warm days it was buzzing and humming with hundreds of honey bees. 
		but their numbers have, and will continue, to diminish very rapidly 
		because of what
		
		you will learn here and
		
		here.
~ ~ ~

metaphorically speaking, bees were among the 
first gasping coal mine-like "canaries" to warn about the 
	self-destruction of mankind. about forty-thousand of dr. rea's "canary" patients and his
	environmental health center 
	in dallas, tx, have also been gasping and shrieking about our collective demise.
 
	although i never was one of his patients, his superior wisdom, together with 
	some of his canaries, 
	saved me from the slow, stealthy, painful death of 
environmental poisoning.  
	toxins and electromagnetic radiation are two of the biggest root causes of 
	the global crashing of 
	
	birds and
	
	bees numbers. my human collapse/diseases/disorder (hcdd) pains have also  forced me to also 
	become a shrieking canary.
i try 
	to pay especially pay close attention 
	to other canaries. there is no substitute foe experience. that may one of 
	many reasons reason i 
	slowly and eventually regained excellent health which i am still enjoying 
	today. after having abandoned all medications about two dozen years ago i 
	have now reached eighty years of age.
what is most remarkable is that whiie i 
	was recovering my overall well-being 
	growing numbers of people were, and are, slowly dying from ever more kinds 
	of chronic illnesses. furthermore, unlike most other people, my life 
	foundation being years in a dark deep dungeon out of which 
	i had to claw myself. i was able to do so single-handedly, 
	before i could begin living a somewhat normal life.
that is i why i have absolute faith in the protection and guidance 
	of the divine. with only a handful of exceptions that has also been the 
	conclusion of almost all the feedback of those who have learned about my 
	life.
~ ~ ~

	from the beginning of my life i struggled from minute after minute, day by day, 
	for more than two decades with seemingly impossible emotional and physical traumas. however, 
	i eventually even prospered in spite of frequent resistance from many other 
	people.

	as strange as it may seem, i never held grudges or  anger and now feel very grateful for 
	what good, ignorant and mean people have taught me all of 
	my life.
 for with much wisdom comes much sorrow; 
	the more knowledge, the more grief.
 ~ ecclesiastes 1:18
i dedicate the only poem that i have ever 
	written to those who are innocently caught up in self-destructive 
	generations. may my true-life story give 
	them inspiration, self-discipline and courage to keep striving towards true 
	knowledge and spiritual guidance for achieving health and happiness:
baby boy resurrected
 its parents committed the most 
	deadly of all possible sins1 that ensured it to fail.
	popular presumptions affirmed that it would spend years in counseling and 
	jail.
	did deathly experiences energize it to overcome years of exploitation, 
	injustice, fiery fights,
	and protect him while sleeping with a colony of mice and highly unstable 
	dynamite?
 did w. h. auden include the fate of this 
	child without mirth
	in his poem, september 1, 1939, the year of this babyâs birth:
i and the public know what all school children learn, 
	those to whom evil is done do evil in return?
 war, near-deaths, school failure, 
	floggings, homelessness, hunger, hard labor slavery2
	earned this most innocent boy misunderstanding about his tenacious bravery.
he found healing in hundreds of books and nature while he quietly 
	suffered.
	who was protecting him from brutal reality to keep him from feeling too 
	battered?
 the shell of to whom so much evil was done cracked 
	from distrust and pains;
	pushing him to higher intuitive hyper-vigilance to propel miraculous gains.
	empathy, discernment and
	spiritual connections were seeding his blessedness.
	would that give him strength to deal with the worst 
	learned helplessness?
 innate curiosity helped him to 
	transition from shyness to becoming ever bolder,
	while retaining firm discipline to re-gain the best of health while growing 
	older.
	so, why did dozens of just aging symptoms accumulate until he was 
	ready to die, 
	while doctors were puzzling his serious illness and did not know 
	the what or why?
 an unknown, angelic, voice phoned him to 
	say: chemicals are making you sick!
he quickly grasped the seriousness of the global distorted-science 
	epidemics.
	did spiritual connections with the earth guide him to grow divinely-created 
	nutrition,
	restoring him to the best of health; long postponing his undertaking with a 
	mortician?

  his compassionate nature desires to share his 
	experiences with a forgiving spirit.
	once with an ailing "reverend" who became so nervous that he did not dare to 
	hear it; 
	the secret about avoiding a global human collapse disease-disorder death.
	why did sharing such experiences evoke: you scare me!, and not 
	under his breath?
 how much do apathy, denial and belief 
	entrapments cause people to forever suffer?
	why do rigid mindsets reject much of what
	conquerors of man-made 
	hell can offer?
what caused this child to thrive beyond nightmares, instead of going 
	insane or die?
	a world traveler, spiritual care volunteer, public speaker and what else 
	became i? 

what a beautiful, poignant poem of death and 
	resurrection of the soul. thank you for sharing. ~ j. gilmore

your "baby boy resurrected" poem really 
	touched me.... i feel i have so much to learn from you.~

	the many-faceted paradox of my persona, seesaw death-life journey and  
	years of related research proved to me the existence of human collapse 
	diseases/disorders (hcdd). the worst aspect of that is 
	that many individuals so affected, as well as most healthcare staff, still do 
	not seem to know or acknowledge that our downfall began already many decades 
	ago.
	hcdd is manifested in two main areas: tens of thousands environmental 
	toxins, and  the very serious dangerous omnipresence of many different 
	kinds of radiation. oddly, there is still very little recognition 
	or acknowledgment by the public and medical establishments of the real and 
	frequently common causes of dozens of chronic illnesses.
because many chronic illnesses are misdiagnosed, 
	some victims so affected often spend themselves into poverty 
	in their search for cures. even worse, they receive little to no support or are 
	completely rejected by their families and friends. they run out of hope. 

	some 
are killing themselves, because 
	they suffer almost incessant miseries of all sorts. no matter where to where 
	they try to escape. i know this all to well because i used to suffer that kind of hell 
	as well and just wanted to die.
we are living during an era when everyone must pay attention and question 
	everything. there are uncountable 
	indications that most of mother nature is gasping its final breaths.

unbelievable? think about what  

dr. rea, r.i.p., 
	and  

many other 
	scientists have to say about the near-future 
	secretive implementation of the 
	worst yet to come: millions of 5g 
	cell antennas within cities and tens of thousands satellites beaming pulsing 
	microwaves into every cell in your body.
for years i suffered from stealthy slow progressing hcdd. 
	that became so painful that i just wanted to die. what few people know is 
	that many of the hcdd conditions can be prevented, and even reversed. my 
	healing again from dozens of such "conditions" prove that it is possible. 
	this page 
	tells you that most important life 
	knowledge about self-preservation is being ignored far too much. and that is 
	one of the reasons why i created this web site.
	because my suffering was too painful and long-lasting, i keep researching 
	"scientific progress, to learn which can harm or help with total wellness.

i looked, but there was no helper, i was appalled that there was no one to give support; so my own arm brought me victory, and as for my wrath, it supported me.~ isaiah 63:5indeed, my own arm and 
	spiritual guidance brought me victory! far beyond anyone's imagination! 
	because such was, is, and will be forever real for me, it may be, or become, 
	so for you, if you...even tough i have always been 
	very curious about a lot of things, i never felt the desire to read about psychiatry or psychology.  i never felt the need to 
	acquire that kind of knowledge and even shunned such information because it 
	caused a vague uneasiness.however, because so many 
	of my readers and audiences could not believe that i was still sane and alive, 
	i began to wonder about that myself. my search for an appropriate book 
	began and ended quickly by finding:
	 invisible heroes: survivors of trauma and how they heal. 
	its researcher, psychotherapist, author, belleruth naparstek, has worked 
	with many trauma survivors. in her concluding chapter, surprise blessings: gifts in 
	the rubble, she describes several major blessings that some 
	trauma survivors receive from suffering. those are:joy, compassion, heightened creativity, survivor power and spiritual connectionâ¦
	...many survivors express gratitude for the renewed connection with the divine that their journey has brought them.
	 they describe a more intimate relation with god. often they talk about a new found ability to source nourishment and renewal from every corner of the universe, every part of the natural world...
...there is a profound and palpable peacefulness that comes from deep inside of them. this inner light, capacity for joy, peaceful centeredness, acceptance of their own strength, and intuitive understanding of others acts subliminally to attract others to them. these are the heroes who lead the way with equal measures of gentleness and personal power. and they remind the one who are still struggling that they can reclaim their lives too..

to be thrown upon one's own resources, is to be cast into the very lap of

	printer (1706 - 1790)
~ ~ ~my parents and the justice 
	system abandoned my little brother and me. completely! they threw us upon 
	our own resources. would we become failures or be cast into the very lap of good fortune? 
	this web site is an overview of my blunt and brutally true life story. it 
	may shock, awe and teach you.
do you sometimes feel like: "i cannot take it anymore?" if so, let me demonstrate that you 
	too "can take a lot more of anything."

how do i know? because "i've been there, done that!" therefore, 
	i am confident that if i, who entered this world during the nazi tyranny, 
	and then "could take" the worst 
	that mankind 
	has to offer, and for so long, you most likely may also be able to lessen your 
	own problems.

altogether my "done that" resulted into very unexpected world-class 
	wisdom-gaining results. best of all, that knowledge also helped me to 
	permanently recover from an unknown number of "incurable chronic illnesses."
here is a tiny nutshell glimpse of my "done 
	that." by the time i was only twenty years old, i had to 
	suffer the following episodes with unending, silent and lonesome patience:
near-deaths from sun over-exposure,  
	diphtheria,  
	whooping cough, bone-rotting ear infection...

	... night-time fire-bombing plus
	years of:  
	near-starvation  homelessness 
	judicial injustice 
	breath-robbing bare-buttocks floggings 
	chronic ear infection  school 
	failure   extreme culture shock  
	total social isolation  
	hard labor  
	slavery.
all of that by the time i was twenty years old, 
	and thereafter, much more.
however, the worst aspect of my early years of 
	world-class terror and torture was that there was no one single person to guide, mentor 
	or support me.

	therefore i had no other choice than to "turn the other cheek" thousands of times. 
	however, do not be saddened by my beginnings because in spite of, or because of, my long sufferings, i received 
	even more blessings than those quoted above from invisible heroes. 
	those blessings have helped to lift me to much higher level of knowledge, wisdom and 
	consciousness. for some people that definitely means being a smart ass.
you learned by now that i am great paradox. instead of suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) i am now enjoying post-traumatic blessings order (ptbo). i did not became bitter or revengeful but received many blessings from my unbelievably impossible long-term traumas. i did not become what is commonly accepted as the most likely result of growing up in an exploded family.
i became the exact opposite. benjamin franklin's wisdom proved to be very true for me and that made me " an unusual man."for example, after my new wife and i graduated from college together, we saved enough to travel around the world for six months. my satirical, blunt-truth memoir, heroes from the attic: a gripping true story of triumph, reads like bizarre fiction and includes a chapter about our low-budget travel adventures. we have now been married 
	more than fifty years. amazingly, a hard life is often quite preventable, because such is mostly man-made and often self-inflicted. episodes in your life that seem to be impossible to overcome can be dealt with through 
	a positive mind-set, self-love, self-discipline, reading and patient endurance.
	after my near-terminal ear infection as a toddler, people thought that i had become an idiot. i also had to learn to walk again. 
	that ear infection was so neglected that it also caused proud flesh, wild meat, to grow in my head. 
	for more than a dozen years thereafter. an internet search for "proud flesh" indicates that i may be the only human being during recent western history that has ever done so, 
	especially over a such a long period of time.and as if all of those problems from birth through teenage years had not been 
	horrendous enough, one of my slave masters made me live in an 
	inhabitable dynamite shack. unbeknownst to anyone, that powerful explosive became highly unstable and dangerous. 
	a bomb disposal expert explained to me later that i should have exploded.
	however, i still do not go into denial about nasty problems. on the contrary, i 
	obsessively seek them out. doing so, has had great benefits because that 
	has helped me to work towards the best of health and happiness much later in 
	life.people frequently ask me questions like, "how were you able to deal with your stresses? how did you manage to survive?" after having thought about this for a long time 
	during my later years, i had to conclude that it could only have been through divine intervention. it could not have been any other way. the odds of my survival, or remaining sane, had been so low that i now challenge anyone to demonstrate how it could have been otherwise. my conclusion seems to be affirmed by many people who have learned his story: "the human potential seems to be infinite!" and "god's plan for you is to inspire."i earned a five-year engineering degree from washington state university. i was a spiritual care volunteer at regional medical center and a psychiatric-behavioral-addiction 
	treatment center. i received nominations for the jefferson award for public service. i am a former member of the american academy of experts in traumatic stress, a past chapter president of toastmasters international, a former member of a chamber of commerce, a planning and zoning commission and a long-time board member of a water users association. i was a 
	co-founder and president of a corporation and a homeowners association.

~ ~ ~quotes of wisdom that highlight the brutal reality and blessings reflected in 
	my poem above:nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.
persistence and determination are omnipotent. the slogan press on has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race. no person was ever honored for what he received. honor has been the reward for what he gave.~ calvin coolidgethe most deadly of all possible sins is the mutilation of a childâs spirit.~ psychoanalyst erik eriksonwhen i feel the heat, i see the	light.~ us senator everett dirkseni have but one lamp ..., and that is the lamp of experience.~ patrick henry...to acquire wisdom one must observe.~ marilyn vos savantthe only source of knowledge is experience.~ albert einsteinyour pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.~ khalil gibranyou can avoid reality, but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality.~ ayn rand...the nearest each of us can come to god is by loving the truth.~ r. buckminster fuller

	...the most deadly of all possible sins is 
	the mutilation of a childâs spirit; for such mutilation undercuts the life 
	principle of trust, without which every human act, may it feel ever so good 
	and seem ever so right is prone to perversion by destructive forms of 
	conscientiousness.~ 
eric erickson
2 one of the two of my masters forced me to work in mud 
	and manure and would not allow me to bathe or shower under the threat of 
	physical punishment. my brother testified before a district court that our 
	relatives "had enslaved us."
