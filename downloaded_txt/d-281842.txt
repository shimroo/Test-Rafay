good education: permission to work.
						
							good memory: power to achieve.










                    it's with big feelings that i shut this down. 
                    visibone products are no longer for sale. 
                    
                    there are multiple reasons, and i do some 'splainin in a 
                    
                        blog post
                    . 
                    

                    short version:  qiki is what's next.
                


 




i made stuff to help you remember and use what you've learned about making web sites.
or if you were just a little adventurous, clues to what to try just beyond what you've learned.
							memory joggers.  facts you keep looking up.  the most common word for them is cheatsheets. 
except i'm not trying to help you pass a test, or ace an interview, or impress the hotties, or 
							any other disposable work. i'm trying to empower you to use more than you can memorize. 
							a lot more.   i made what i need to feel thoroughly competent.  i sell them in case you do too.
hope you find useful things here, and get a lot done a little faster because of them. 
subjects: color, fonts, html, css, javascript, mysql, and php.
i believe complexity is best mastered by seeing the whole picture in rich detail; that 
							expertise consists mainly of vivid mental pictures; that working knowledge is best aided 
							by precise reminders within view or reach.  i've tried to give you both extremes, the 
							totality at a glance, with as much useful detail as can fit.  i've tried to quench your left-brain's 
							thirst for facts and seed your right-brain's power for intuitive, subconscious wonder.  
							it'd sure be my honor if you find this stuff helps.
