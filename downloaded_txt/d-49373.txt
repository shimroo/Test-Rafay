welcome to forestland associates

i worked in the corporate world for 15 years, and while i was there, i always hoped that one day i’d be able to take my knowledge and passion for “all things land” and use it to help people. that prayer was answered, and today i’m able to do just that!  when helping someone with any of our services, i realize the weight of my responsibility to them and their land. selling timber or land, for example, is an extremely important event that only happens a few times, maybe even once, in a lifetime.  i consider it an honor and so much more than just a transaction. when i’m helping a landowner formulate a plan to improve the wildlife habitat and timber production on their property, i know how important it is to them because i know how important my land and these valuable resources are to me.  at forestland associates, we’re here to put our passion to work for you.

testimonials





											kevin successfully represented me in two recent land transactions in lasalle parish, louisiana.  as an out of state seller, it was especially essential that i worked with a knowledgeable, connected, and ethical real estate professional who is proactive, has a problem solver mindset, and puts the needs of his clients first.

kevin effectively communicated with me on a regular basis, providing me with updates regarding interested parties, market conditions, and even routinely inspected the properties to make sure they were kept clear of debris and remained pristine.
further, kevin frequently met with prospective buyers on-site, promptly researched and answered their questions about the properties of interest, and often provided them with reputable contacts to assist them with financing and closing needs.
kevin’s impeccable reputation and expertise in forestry, land management, real estate, and related services makes him the ultimate partner to work with.  i highly recommend kevin daugherty and forestland associates, llc.

											we have worked with kevin for about 15 years, and it is a pleasure to have him as our consulting forester. he is a member of the association of consulting foresters so we feel kevin helps us manage our 160-acre tract sustainably as well as economically. kevin's annual walk around our tract and the subsequent report has been most beneficial.

											i have worked with forestland associates for some years now and can say it has been a pleasure doing business with them. kevin not only handled easement rights and timber sales but helped me sell some property also. he was there from the first cut to the last part of the cleanup. he went back behind the loggers and found some trees that they had missed. i look forward to a long and prosperous relationship going forward.
