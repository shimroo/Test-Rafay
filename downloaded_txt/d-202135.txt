who we are


uncle calvin’s coffeehouse is a not-for-profit, volunteer-run live music venue, presenting concerts nearly every friday night in the 
                fellowship hall of northpark presbyterian church in dallas, tx. our goal is to bring you the best possible environment for 
                listening to music, with clear, pristine sound, free of smoke, alcohol, and conversation. in addition to the music, we offer fine coffees, teas, 
                juices, desserts, and salty snacks.  find out more about us here.
