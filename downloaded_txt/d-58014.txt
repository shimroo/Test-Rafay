research













carbon cycle greenhouse gases

	measurements and modeling of the distributions of greenhouse gases, providing constraints to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. 
    







greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances

	quantifying the distributions and magnitudes of the sources and sinks for 
	important ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases.
    








global radiation and aerosols

	research on the earth's 
	surface radiation budget
	and the climate-forcing properties of aerosol particles.
    







ozone and water vapor

	research on the depletion 
	of the stratospheric ozone layer and the role of ozone and 
	water vapor in forcing climate change.
    







modeling

        gml devlops modeling systems to track the emissions and fluxes of greenhouse gases.
