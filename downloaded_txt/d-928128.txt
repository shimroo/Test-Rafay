activities




wildlife & wilderness viewing
wherever we travel, we will explore areas with abundant wildlife and  pristine wilderness. get absorbed in a beautiful destination and see a  diverse range of species. see the spirit bear, whales, bears, birds,  wolves, marine mammals and more.
 

sailing
sailing is another highlight of our voyages. with our focus on wildlife  and exploring ashore, we mostly motor at low speeds. we set the sails  depending on weather & time.


 
 
 



native culture
we incorporate the rich history of the coastal first nations /  native  americans in all of our trips. there are lots of interesting old  villages and museums - and you will get the chance to meet local native  guides and elders.
 

kayaking / exploring
each day there is the opportunity to kayak, if you are interested. we  anchor in secluded bays and if you want to explore freely on your own,   slip into one of our stable sea kayaks.
