			let's ride





we’ve been publishing information about motorcycle events for 22 years. 
yep, we were online before google.  we’ve had some good years and some bad ones. we’ve had times when we were the most popular motorcycle events website on the internet. we’ve had times when we were only a few days from closing. the last few years we’ve been redesigning and rebuilding.  we’ve dropped a few sections of our site but plan to bring most of them back even better than ever.  check us out. we think you will like what you see.
