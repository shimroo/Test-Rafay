a heritage of community

as early as the late 1880's you would find the brandt family at work in helping shape nampa and the treasure valley through roles in real estate and civic leadership; this legacy represents over three generations of philanthropic generosity. with care for the people they've worked with they have touched nearly every facet of the community from business and industry to education and the arts. their entrepreneurial spirit, civic involvement and commitment to education, culture, religion, business and recreation have improved the quality of life for thousands of residences — young and old — and will continue to do so for generations to come. 

the brandt agency represents the continuation of this proud tradition through serving southwest idaho with exceptional real estate services that combine knowledge and experience in order to provide outstanding results. we invite you to visit with us here, learn more about idaho, and find the properties where you can start building your dreams!

patty jordan helped!

i have nothing but good things to say about patty. she went above and beyond to help me sell my home and was always friendly and available. i felt very comfortable contacting her and she made the process clear and a little less intimidating. i would absolutely recommend her for all home  buying/selling needs.  - j. bell

if you have trouble seeing web pages, the us social security administration offers these tips for optimizing your computer and browser to improve your online experience.


use the keyboard to navigate screens
increase text size
magnify your screen
change background and text colors


if you find a keyboard or mouse difficult to use, speech recognition software such as dragon naturallyspeaking may help you navigate web pages and online services. this software allows the user to move focus around a web page or application screen through voice controls.
if you are deaf or hard of hearing, there are several accessibility features available to you.


transcripts
a text transcript is a text equivalent of audio information that includes spoken words and non-spoken sounds such as sound effects. nar is working on adding transcripts to all scripted video and audio content.


captioning
a caption is transcript for the audio track of a video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio tracks. captions are generally rendered visually by being superimposed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio (e.g., when in a crowded room). most of nar's video content includes captions. learn how to turn captioning on and off in youtube.


volume controls
your computer, tablet, or mobile device has volume control features. each video and audio service has its own additional volume controls. try adjusting both your device's volume controls and your media players' volume controls to optimize your listening experience.
