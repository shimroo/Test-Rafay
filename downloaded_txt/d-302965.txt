my wordpress.org blog www.frot.co.nz has been online since january 1 2016, so it’s eight years old now, and has over 750 posts. but it is heavily blacklisted, and the hits have dropped from a peak of over 2000 a day in 2017 to less than 100 a day in 2023, which isn’t very inspiring. wordpress […]

the end of the year is always a good time to reassess how everything is going and decide what to do next. in the middle of 2023 i went back to using blogger and still found it to be the same convenient and easy to use blogging platform it was a decade ago. so i’ve […]

we all tend to think we understand what is going on, and all the people who are levels behind ourselves in this multi level learning game are retarded. which they are. but each time we move up a level, our old self appears retarded, compared with our present self. and hopefully that process keeps on […]

my geek secret – i am dirty and bad. i still use windows 7 although i like to tell everyone i’m not a geek, i do have more than a dozen computers, laptops,  & tablets. the reason i reassure myself that i’m not a geek is that i find it a bit of a struggle […]

as a music fan and a “conspiracy theorist” i’ve long been confused and conflicted about the beatles. maybe part of what keeps pulling me back to look at them is that i know i have never fully understood this story, but i suspect that it ties into almost every deep state cover up for the […]

 for october i had a break from blogging as well as using all social media. i then bounced back and did a post on blogger every day through november, but quiting using social media platforms is probably going to be a permanent thing for me. part of the reason for that is that i suspect […]

as part of my ongoing experiments with testing out alternative platforms for blogging, in a feeble attempt to get around google’s relentless blacklisting, recently i have mostly been posting short posts on my new blogger account www.sift.co.nz (in the belly of the beast!) but i had a month off all social media and blogging for october, […]

bleeding aussie roo shaggers as a kiwi, sometimes i am horrified to be mistaken for an aussie. usually by americans. so now i’m going to explain some key differences between kiwis and aussies. people in other countries often assume that because we are neighbours, we are just like each other, and great mates as well.

i haven’t been out cruising for rides, i’ve been busy hiding up my own arse. for the past four months i’ve been sticking to my own little corner of the web, my own two sifty little blogs, where all commenting is turned off, but so are any rewards. confined to a chair with a sprained […]
