    i'm a little late on this entry, as it is the middle of january 2013. i had meant to drop a few lines at the end of 2012 but like many other important things i've vowed to tackle in life, the thoughts found themselves in a holding pattern up in the grey matter. but hey! now is as good a time as any, right?  the past year has been an amazing experience, all around. i thought 2011 was a banger of a year, but 2012 actually topped that and then some. we were faced with challenges and adversity, but we always overcame them and moved forward. that's what life is about.  i started of 2012 still living in my cozy grandview heights town home and continuing the daily grind with chase home finance. rochelle flew out to spend the new year with me, and i took her out on the town. we were able to see the columbus zoo lights on new year's eve, did some major shopping at easton town center. at the end of her visit, i surprised her by flying back out to virginia for a few more days....

we americans are constantly being reminded by the media and our politicians about how terrible things are in this country. in 2008, obama ran on a ticket of hope and change, successfully using the economic troubles of the bush administration to convince the voting populace that his administration would be able to turn things around. in the present presidential contest, mitt romney's campaign is pushing it's own "hope and change" message, promising that their agenda will usher in a new era of prosperity and economic recovery. what these two self-serving politicians aren't telling you is that the goal is not to change a thing, but to maintain the status quo. have you ever wondered why the fringe issue of abortion always gets bantered around by politicians seeking election, but never is acted upon? why change things? if roe vs. wade was overturned, republicans couldn't run on a ticket of opposing abortion anymore. they would effectively lose that bargaining chip....

i'm sitting in a terminal of detroit international airport. terminal; that's a great term for something that you are going to fly out of, right? i am taking an impromptu trip to dc to see rochelle. this was completely spur of the moment. sometimes, it's the little unplanned things that make life so wonderful.  while i'm in virginia, i'll be walking in a ccfa event in reston, something i really wanted to do ever since i heard about it.i will also meet one of rochelle's kids, hannah, for the first time. this is a big thing. jc has been hesitant to allow me to meet the kids. i suppose it's natural jealousy or something to that nature. that's okay. i'm not trying to take his place as a father. i'm only trying to be the rock in rochelle's life that she needs. it will take time, but we will all get there, i believe.   so now, i need to do some classwork. i'm writing an op ed essay for english 111. a thesis. ugh. i hate these types of assignment...

hearing about the passing of steve jobs this week reminded me once again, of how brief our life is here on spaceship earth. the sum of our lifetimes are but mere blips in the timeline of the universe. we form from the elements, have a flash of self-awareness, then dissolve back into the dust that we were birthed from to give life to something else. steve jobs didn't waste his time here barely existing. he didn't set his life on cruise control and attempt to go along for the ride. he created his own ride. he chose his own journey, and in doing so, impacted the lives of millions around the world. his impact will be recognized in the history books for generations to come. he is legend.     so this led me to wonder if a college dropout like jobs can reach out for his dreams and grab them, what's stopping me? why do i feel like the world is conspiring to hold me back sometimes? really, success is a state of mind... a desire. jobs once said, "stay hungry" perhaps that i...

"lights will guide you home...and ignite your bones... and i will try... to fix you"   sometimes in life, i have to take a step back and remind myself that i cannot fix some things in life, as much as i really want to. this is an especially difficult lesson to understand when someone i love greatly is suffering, whether it be physical pain or mental. what makes things worse is that i am 300 miles away from even being able to hug her and tell her that everything is going to be alright. somehow, i have got to learn to accept that life isn't perfect and i cannot fix this thing about her.... it is part of who she is, like her nose or her little toe. i have to learn to help her cope and give her reassurance that there is light at the end of the tunnel. i know for a fact that she would do the same for me .

  one thing that we have in common as human beings, something that is definitely absent among the ranks of the lower mammalian, is the unique and beautiful ability to dream. i'm not talking about the random (and sometimes scary) visions that roam about our heads at night while we are in that deep r.e.m. state. what i am referring to is the way we can imagine and produce a mental road map or itinerary of what we want to do, see or accomplish in life. some call it a plan. some call it their bucket list. i refer to it as my wishlist.   "you must be the change you wish to see in the world." - mohandas gandhi Â   as babes, we enter life being asked by the grown ups, what exactly do we wish for. i remember in kindergarten, in between the naps and learning the letters of the alphabet, my teacher asking me, "what do you want to be when you grow up?" most of us replied with the grade school standard 'fireman', 'policeman' or 'astronaut'. an enterpr...
