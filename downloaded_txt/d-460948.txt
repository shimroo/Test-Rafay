a wheel thatchanges everything

about us
in 2002, a european motorcycle racer joined forces with an ibm and microsoft international executive – with a vision to create the world’s most advanced carbon fibre wheel. the result of this partnership is a wheel that has changed everything. a wheel precision engineered to meet the most exacting demands and most demanding conditions, exceeding the highest standards in safety and performance. the strongest, lightest, fastest wheel on track or road.
two decades later, bst have supplied their award-winning lightweight carbon fibre wheels to tens of thousands of motorsport champions, motoring enthusiasts and leading oems across the globe, designing and manufacturing wheels for some of the world’s most prestigious car and motorcycle brands. recently, bst unveiled the world’s first and only 100% carbon fibre automotive wheel.
