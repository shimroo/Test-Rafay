client testimonials 





"i didn’t want a ‘one-size-fits-all’ product. the system had to flow the way doctors want to work. healthbridge clinical is based on the soap model & enables doctors to capture consultations by either typing their notes or by using easy to click through templates, or a combination of both."




 

dr esat - general practitioner









"the system needed to trend patient data, so i could provide better patient care.
patient paper files makes trending data almost impossible. healthbridge clinical easily collates important patient data into meaningful trending graphs, giving you insight into your patient’s health over time."




 

dr castelyn - general practitioner









“i needed a solution that could send billing data seamlessly to my billing system. healthbridge clinical automatically converts your diagnosis, procedures, consumables & medication into billing instructions that can be sent directly to medical aids, or saved to be sent by staff later.”
