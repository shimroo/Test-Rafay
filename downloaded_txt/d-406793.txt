wildwoodians, fifty-six years ago today, johnny cash walked into cbs studios in nashville to record a duet with a young singer-songwriter named bob dylan. apart from producing an incredible version of dylan’s “girl from the north country” for dylan’s nashville skyline, it was a musically historic collaboration. by giving the radical dylan his co-sign, longtime country vanguard johnny cash told the country music establishment that the times they were a-changin’ and that there might be a new sound brewing in nashville. later, kris kristofferson would say of the historic session “our generation owes him our artistic lives because he opened all the doors in nashville when he did blonde on blonde and nashville skyline....he brought in a whole new audience. he changed the way people thought about it – even the grand ole opry was never the same again.” in honor of their legendary 1969 session, we present a pair of sj-200s: one johnny cash signature model and one 1957 reissue similar to the one bob dylan holds on the cover of nashville skyline. if you want to learn more about our incredible selection of custom shop gibson acoustics, please drop us a line or give us a call! also, let us know your favorite nashville-era bob dylan song in the comments—we think it’s “lay, lady lay” but we’re open to debate.@johnnycash @bobdylan @gibsonguitar @gibsoncustom @gibsonsofinstagram #johnnycash #bobdylan #guitarist #gearybusey #guitarsofinstagram #gibson #gibsonguitars #blondeonblonde #gibsonsj200 #wildwoodguitars #guitar ...

wildwoodians, have you ever wondered how our friends at the gibson custom shop achieve juuuust the right hue for the viking red finish on our wildwood spec es-335 reissues? well, the answer is simple: they mix in real blood from viking warriors for maximum authenticity! now, you may find yourself pondering questions like and “didn’t the viking age end in 1066 after harald iii was defeated by the saxons at the battle of stamford bridge?” and “doesn’t that seem like an awful lot of trouble to go through for a guitar?” and “how do they get the blood?” well, gibson’s custom shop wizards have their ways (and by “ways” we mean a glowing cave beneath the custom shop that takes a twisting path through space and time), but it isn’t easy. vikings generally are unwilling blood donors, so gibson’s builders often have to use non-traditional tools of lutherie like flails, maces, and battle axes to get the job done. it just goes to show you that the gibson custom shop is always willing to go the extra mile for authenticity. if you’d like to hear more about the authentic features of this gorgeous es-335 (serial 141064), give us a buzz or drop us a line and we’d be happy to tell you all about it. happy #gibsunday everyone.@gibsoncustom @gibsonguitar #gibsones335 #viking #vikingred #gibsonsofinstagram #guitar #guitarplayer #geartalk #gibson335 #gibsonguitars #wildwoodguitars ...

wildwoodians, playing this chris cornell signature es-335 was a genuinely special, moving experience for me. like many people with excellent taste and perfect opinions, i love soundgarden, especially badmotorfinger. let me tell you, when i tuned this serial to drop d and played the opening riff to outshined, it was absolutely magical. the best signature guitars are like portals in the universe of your favorite artist, and this guitar made me feel like i was in soundgarden. in a word, it was awesome! i felt like i was wielding one of my favorite recorded guitar tones in real life, and that got the creativity flowing immediately, so much so that i had to unplug and turn the faucet off or else this evaluation would never get written!though this chris cornell signature es-335 is certainly a collector’s item as only 250 were ever made, it’s also a true sonic titan capable of inspiring you to break your rusty cage and run. i’m sure whatever lucky player winds up with this serial will agree that it cannot be outshined!@gibsonguitar @gibsoncustom @chriscornellofficial #es335 @soundgarden #chriscornell #gibsonsofinstagram #guitar #gearybusey #gibsones335 #soundgarden #guitarplayer #noonesingslikeyouanymore #wildwoodguitars #colorado ...

wildwoodians, we are pleased to present ryan malicsi’s reverend signature model. malicsi is the lead guitarist for michigan-based band hot mulligan, and his creative riffing and fiery chops have helped make them one of the tentpoles of the midwest emo scene. their knotty, complex yet catchy riffs could put the fear of god into some prog rock bands, and their plaintive, heartfelt songwriting is the kind that inspires hearty, arm-in-arm shoutalongs to songs with incredible titles like “please don’t cry, you have swag,” “shhhh! golf is on,” and “featuring mark hoppus” (which does not, in fact, feature the blink 182 bassist).because our friends at reverend have perfect opinions about music, they decided to give mr. malicsi a super-sweet signature reverend based on his trusty jetstream 390 with some extra style and tonal tweaks thrown in. be forewarned, wildwoodians: if you play one of these guitars, make sure to equip your sunglasses, because sparks are going to fly and you’ll need cool-looking eye protection! for more about this guitar and other other reverends, check out our reverend page on our website, give us a call, or drop us a line!@hotmulligan @reverendguitars @ryanmalicsi #gearybusey #reverendguitars #geartalk #gearycoleman #guitarplayer #guitar #guitarist #reverendjetstream #guitarsofinstagram ...

wildwoodians, there’s no wrong way to chillax on super bowl weekend, but our favorite technique is plug one of our wildwood spec les paul juniors into a tube amp, turn it all the way up, and play mississippi queen over and over while enjoying frosty beverages until the neighbors either join the tailgate or call the police. if you’d like to learn more about why these guitars inspire us to riff so mightily that we flagrantly disregard the customs and norms of polite society, head on over to our custom shop les paul junior page! also, feel free to give us a call or drop us a line if you have any questions or if you just want to talk about why mississippi queen is the best song ever. who ya got hoisting the #vincelombardi trophy? let us know in the comments!@gibsoncustom @gibsonmurphylab #kansascitychiefs #philadelphiaeagles @vintagelespaul #gibsonguitars #tvyellow #gibsonsofinstagram #gear #gearycoleman #lespauljunior #wildwoodguitars ...

***sold***wildwoodians, today is the birthday of rappers rick ross and j. cole and def leppard drummer rick allen, which seemed like an excellent excuse to remind people that cole went platinum with no features and to offer up a very gently-used custom color series ‘61 sg at a hysteria-inducing value. it sounds killer thanks to its burstbucker pickups, and the classic white finish is as elegant and stylish as they come. the only cosmetic flaw to report is a little bit of burn-through in the finish on the horn. other than that, it’s pretty minty-fresh, and it’s guaranteed to make every other guitar player on your block clench their fists in jealous rage. we have no doubt you’ll enjoy this guitar as much as we enjoy blasting def lep’s seminal 1983 lp pyromania at the shop! head on over to our reverb page for more details on serial 211540331. feast!@gibsonguitar @reverb #gibsonsg #gibson61sg #guitarist #guitarplayer #gearybusey #gibsonguitars #gearycoleman #gibsonofinstagram #gibsonoftheday #wildwoodguitars ...
