we provide a permanent home for those needing sanctuary. the animals we rescue have been either abandoned, neglected, surrendered or abused. they have stories to share of survival, thriving, learning to trust again, and the healing power of unconditional love. we share their stories in a variety of ways through community presentations, on-site visits, and partnering with nonprofit organizations helping people in our healing hearts program. shy wolf sanctuary provides a permanent home to over 40 exotic residents and sometimes as many as 50 animals. the wolves and other resident animals are housed on a 2.5 acre property in naples (fl) and are supported by over 80 active volunteers. captive-bred exotic animals such as wolfdogs are generally considered unadoptable by domestic animal services and have nowhere else to go. shy wolf sanctuary is literally their last hope.
