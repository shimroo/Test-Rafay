do i need a midboost?yes, you do.james tyler, a great guitar player in his own right, really hated the bright lead tones of many guitarists when they would rip on a solo on the high strings. he worked with demeter to get his midboost where jim liked the tone. it boosts around 150db, so it’s really a bass boost but rolls off the highs from 3k and up creating a more round and delicious soaring note.

 

 
















































we arejames tyler guitarsjames tyler started out doing custom electric guitar work and repairs in the early 1970’s. his reputation grew by word of mouth up through the later 1980’s and early 1990’s when a lot of top session players and artists in the los angeles studio scene trusted him to give them exactly what they needed. he listened to his customers and pushed the limits by constantly seeking what could be improved. this kind of hands-on experience with thousands of guitars and an exclusive clientele has given james keen insight into how things work and what players want.

“if you have to sell every other electric guitar you own to raise funds for a tyler studio elite hd, you should do so.”
