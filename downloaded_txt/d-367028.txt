i took a class today with the wonderful watercolorist  rena brouwer! unfortunately, i didn't do it justice.  she gave lots of great tips and advice - i just couldn't get into it that much today. i don't like my building at all but i'll try again.last night i finally worked on this week's tast.  i particularly like the herringbone stitch done with two threads or more.  it creates a nice texture and pattern of interest.  it took me awhile to get the hang of it.  now i want to use it somewhere!

kim millar's lover's knot pattern  from the wayback machine! i've been meaning to tat this heart since i printed it out in july of 2002. it could use some tweaking. the single crochet braid is like mini-ricrac. kim came up with several patterns using crocheted braids. the pattern on the wayback machine no longer has the photos, which includes a diagram of the heart so feel free to add this image if you print it out, although it's not the best example. i have 14 patterns by kim and most use crochet braid. i also tried finding her geocities site (http://www.geocities.com/kimtats/index.htm) with the wayback machine as that was where i originally saved my copies from, but no luck. kim is canadian but i haven't seen or heard anything from her in years. i'd love to share her patterns but need her permission to do so. so the best i can do at the moment is give you the wayback machine link.i used manuela size 20 for the bright pink and cebelia size 20 for the pale pink. some cebelia's are fairly crisp threads but this one was soft and wanted to separate. i didn't really like tatting with it. i didn't do a good job joining the braid at the top. i had a little trouble understanding exactly what she meant but i'll try it again in a slightly different way. i can't believe it's 57 degrees at nearly 6:00 p.m. on january 30th!  i get chills a lot so i'm not at all unhappy!

anonymous comments





ever since i changed the way my comment window shows up, i've gotten tons of anonymous spam comments. they're really annoying.  one was a friend so i hate not to allow anonymous comments but i think i'm going to have to go there.  i'll be glad when blogger fixes their glitches as i didn't have that problem with the embedded comment format.  i still reject them before they appear but it's a pain to get up everyday and find half a dozen or more spam comments.  anyone else notice this?

pansy shuttle!





no tatting.  i got discouraged with the calf and have not decided what i want to do next.  i've been working on other stitching and laces and just haven't felt inspired to tat.i do have to say i broke down and ordered this pansy shuttle from la cossette after lusting for it for a few years. i got a lily of the valley one through my lace guild last year but this is the one i really wanted.  it just wasn't offered as one of the commemorative shuttles.  this is the front.and this is the back. i don't like tatting with these type of shuttles so it will be forever innocent and pristine. i know.....that seems almost sinful but i long ago gave up trying to tat with every shuttle i own.  some are enough pleasure to look at and hold from time to time.

another gingko leaf





this one is for a leaf project with my lace guild - but now that i've scanned it, i plan to make a better one for the project. i knew the last chain seemed long for some reason and my corner didn't look too good either. this is really not that hard of a pattern and quick to tat but it looks like i'm going to have to tat it more than once or twice to get it to look good!it's been super cold the past few days. this is why i don't like winter. i've never been that fond of winter, even as a child. i like a white snow - once a year. i don't like mind-numbing cold. that's why i've been looking forward to moving some place warmer though it looks like i'll have to wait until i retire to manage it.i worked last night and this morning on a romanian point lace lobster cord tutorial in pdf for my lace guild too. we'll see if it's helpful in the morning when i meet with some guild members.i stitched my tast for the week and posted it, plus i've worked in bits and pieces on my embroider, embellish and create piece. i really want to clean out my craft/computer room but i guess it will wait until next week. and i need to prepare a bobbin lace project! hmmmm...maybe i've got too much going on?hope everyone has a great weekend planned!
