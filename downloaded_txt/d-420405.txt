  st. vincent pallotti high school

founded in 1921, the school is the oldest coeducational, catholic, secondary, college preparatory school in the archdiocese of washington. pallotti offers young men and women the best of both worlds. we are large enough to boast a wide-ranging curriculum including specialized areas of study, cutting edge technology, and a diverse selection of extracurricular activities. we are also small enough that each student is treated as an individual, possessing unique talents and abilities. pallotti is a place where young people can receive the nurturing they need and the freedom to spread their wings.
