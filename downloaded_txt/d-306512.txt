aero dyne sound control company has been a trusted name in the hvac industry for over 50 years. we specialize in manufacturing our high efficiency profile (h-e-p) turning vane and rail system, designed specifically for commercial hvac installations. our products address the difficult challenges of inefficient airflow inefficiencies and noisy ducts, reducing sound power and pressure loss to the lowest possible levels.






h-e-p turning vanes
the high efficiency profile (h-e-p) turning vane and rail system is used in hvac systems to smoothly redirect airflow within ductwork, by minimizing turbulence and pressure loss, resulting in more efficient air distribution and reduced noise levels, often specified for projects requiring high performance airflow like hospitals and entertainment  centers.

based on results from the etl testing laboratories, inc. report no. 48037, aero dyne h-e-p turning vanes are certified for performance. the high efficiency profile design lowers relative pressure loss and reduces generated sound power to the lowest level attainable. our design geometry adapts perfectly to all duct sizes, eliminating the need for two different vane sizes in the system. no other turning vane provides comparable quality, structural integrity, and performance for commercial hvac installations.

why engineers and contractors choose aero dyne


aero dyne has been the preferred choice for hvac design engineers and contractors for more than 50 years. consulting engineers specify our products for commercial hvac installations, knowing our vanes will meet rigorous performance standards. many projects with a focus on high-performance, sustainable design have requested aero dyne by name, with “no substitutions” written into the specifications. our turning vanes have been installed in thousands of projects, including schools, hospitals, museums, performing arts centers and any project where performance is a priority.
technical benefits:

sound performance: aero dyne h-e-p generated sound power levels do not exceed 54 decibels in band 4 at 2,000 fpm (24″x24″ duct size), a requirement for many engineers.
manufacturing excellence: aero dyne products are manufactured in the usa, with steel sourced mainly from north american steel mills. our manufacturing process adheres to strict standards and is certified under iso 9001:2008.
efficiency: the true airfoil contour design of aero dyne vanes reduces relative pressure loss to the lowest level attainable, which results in lower fan horsepower requirements, leading to operational cost savings year-round.

product description:
the h-e-p turning vane and rail system has three essential components: the airfoil blade, vane side rail, and fasteners. performance may be compromised if assemblies are made without genuine aero dyne side rails.

3″ radius airfoil blade: engineered using a 17-point roll-forming process using one-piece 27ga hd prime carbon galvanized steel.
vane side rail: constructed from 24ga hd galvanized steel, with assembly slots located on design center spacing of 2.4 inches.
fasteners: ring shank style screws fasten into continuous channels inside the blade, providing rigid, rattle-proof assemblies, eliminating need for reinforcing rods.








proven quality and durability


unlike standard turning vanes, aero dyne vanes are laboratory-tested and certified for performance.  we have been committed to providing the best turning vane available in the market for over 50 years. the 17 point precision roll-forming process creates our proprietary continuous fastening tubes that prevent distortion and fluttering under air flow, providing unmatched reliability in commercial hvac installations.
