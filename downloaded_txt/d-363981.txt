                                  this was an amazing experience! my husband and i booked passage on a 3 day trip with captain greg and chef/first mate romelo for our anniversary. we have been trying to explore more of our own state, and this was the best way to experience the san juan islands. i only wish we could have been on the boat longer! captain greg was very knowledgeable about the islands and was more than happy to teach us about the boat and sailing. romelo is an amazing chef! we requested oysters and they delivered! if you are wanting an intimate and unique experience, you must sail with emerald isle sailing! 10*

                                  we had so much fun exploring the san juan islands with captain greg and his 1st mate & chef extraordinaire, romello. captain greg's experience and knowledge made us feel very comfortable and we learned so much! romello's meals were amazing, and he graciously (and deliciously!) accommodated our dietary restrictions. highly recommend!

                                  had a fabulous 6-day trip sailing around the san juan islands. captain greg was very knowledgeable about the islands, hiking trails, bays to anchor in, local history and nature—and of course sailing. he tailored the trip to what we wanted: hiking, more time on the water, etc. chef romelo was outstanding. created great dishes using local seafood and produce. the trip was so relaxing—i highly recommend it.

                                  our 6 day sailing charter exceeded all expectations. from captain greg and all the knowledge of the san juans that he shared to chef romello and his fabulous meals, it was a special event. of course the biggest star of all, besides the ship, was the day in and day out of the san juan islands. truly memorable!

                                  i just completed an emerald isle sailing charter with greg sellentin aboard his 55 foot pilot house ketch in the san juan islands north of seattle. this has been on the top of my bucket list for years. i am a seasoned sailor and owner of a 48 foot sloop so my expectations were high. greg, his yacht and his first/mate/gourmet cook-romello were in a word--fantastic -and truly exceeding my expectations. the yacht has 8 berths (with 5 staterooms) and their were 4 guests-2 ladies(in the v-berth) and 2 guys(one in the double bunk berth) and the other(me) in the aft quarter berth. , it was a great mix of folks and we all became friends very quickly...and everyone got along famously. the itinerary chosen for exploring part of the san juan islands( there are over 100), north of seattle , was excellent. we had windy times allowing for brisk sailing and quiet calm times when we motor sailed--all great. the anchorages were in beautiful quiet coves surrounded by awesome northwest scenery. the pilot house configuration of the yacht permitted full viewing of the spectacular scenery whether you were inside or on deck. greg chose these excellent beautiful spots to drop anchor and he had both kayaks and paddle boards to play with . the guests , especially the ladies did a great deal of island exploring, walking over 10,000 steps each day. i have a bad knee but was fully entertained and delighted with the trip even though i spent most of my time aboard. after all-i am a sailor. words can't truly explain how great greg and morello were. meals were awesome(thanks romello) and healthy-truly a gourmet cook and a budding good sailor. and i cant say enough about greg and how smoothly he ran the whole operation. if you were not an experience sailor he would teach you, if you were, you could participate (or not) as much as you wanted to. plus he has a fascinating life history , including running sled dogs in alaska. i would highly highly recommend chartering with greg and romello, whether you a land lubber or experienced sailor. it was truly an outstanding experience. richard g fisher md

					san juan islands, washington
				









the san juan islands include 172 named islands and reefs off the coast of washington state. departing from anacortes, the washington state ferries serve orcas island, lopez island, and san juan island. each island offers a unique opportunity for adventure. activities include sailing, hiking, biking, kayaking, and enjoying the simple rustic beauty of the san juan islands.
the san juan islands enjoy a moderate year-round climate. winters experience an average temperature of 40 degrees f, while summers enjoy a glorious average of 70 degrees f. sailing with us in the san juan islands offers a chance to spot humpback whales, orcas, and minke whales, and see flower-filled meadows, mountain-framed horizons, hidden coves, and emerald waters. the beauty of this area casts a spell hard to undo.










					frequently asked questions
				









					most frequent questions and answers
				



what kinds of wildlife might i see? the coastlines we sail are rich with life. depending on the time of year, sea mammals you might see include orca, humpback and minke whales, harbor porpoise, dahl’s porpoise, white-sided dolphins, sea otters, river otters, harbor seals, and sea lions.
on land you have the opportunity to see minks, otters, black-tailed deer, raccoons, and imported exotic wildlife. as we journey northward it becomes increasingly likely to find coastal wolves, mountain goats, black bears, grizzlies, and the white kermode, or “spirit” bear.
there are too many feathered friends to list. the bald eagle is a daily visitor. other favorites of ours include oyster catchers, marbled murrelettes, scoters, and great blue herons. for a truly world class natural experience the old-growth forests of northern b.c.’s great bear rainforest house an especially rich and diverse community of creatures. our unobtrusive electric powered dingy allows us the unique advantage of near silence while viewing and photographing wildlife.
what sort of clothes should i bring? it’s best to be prepared for a temperature range of 55° to 80° f. when sailing, even on a warm summer day, the breeze experienced on deck when heading up wind can elicit the need for cozier clothing. the best dress for sailing is layers. for northern tours, close to the skin, wear a moisture wicking layer, then an insulative layer (fleece, wool...), and an outer wind/water resistant layer. waterproof shoes or rubber boots are an advantage on deck and for getting to and exploring shorelines and estuaries. shorts and a bathing suit are great for a summer swim or hot spring soak. for life below decks bring casual and comfortable clothing. don’t forget your favorite pair of slippers! we’ll send you a detailed list of what to bring when you submit your reservation.
what is the weather like? the san juan and gulf islands are known for their sunny summer days. we receive about half the rain of seattle due to the rainshadow of the olympics and vancouver island mountain ranges. temperatures range from 55°-80° f in the spring, summer, and fall, and average 40°-50° f in the winter months. the great bear rainforest of northern b.c. produces more variable weather. it’s not called a rain forest for nothing! temperatures are usually in the 60s throughout our sailing season there. you will likely encounter a mix of sunshine with occasional rain during your trip, but you will stay warm and dry in our roomy pilothouse.
what time of year should i sail with you? it depends on what you are looking for. april and may display an incredible abundance of spring flowers. some areas are particularly spectacular with color at this time. the sunniest and warmest months of the year are july, august, and september. this is the best time of year to see the great bear rainforest. october through mid-june offers the best sailing wind and the most quiet privacy in anchorages. we have had incredible trips in january! with our heating systems and all-weather pilothouse this time of year can be a magically peaceful and comfortable experience.
what if i get seasick? nearly all of the waters we sail in are well protected. most people who are concerned about seasickness are pleasantly surprised that its not an issue for them on our trips. however, some of our trips involve making brief passages that can occasionally get rough enough to elicit this unfortunate gastronomic state. we recommend you speak with your doctor or pharmacist regarding appropriate motion sickness medication. in our experience for mild queasiness, the acupressure wrist bands, ginger tea or crystallized ginger (which we have on board), and staying above decks can be of great help. the good news is that after we’ve finished a rough passage, the seasickness disappears!
are children welcome on your charters? absolutely! we love having children on board. it can be a hugely educational experience for them. there are many activities to keep them occupied, and enough new and exiting experiences to keep them talking about their trip for a long time. we do, however, prefer that if your child is younger that 10 that the guest list is filled by your party alone.
what is a “crewed” charter? it’s a cruise that includes a captain and crew/chef who take care of all shipboard duties including safe navigation, local knowledge of choice attractions, and meals and cleaning. you can do as much or as little as you like. we are at your service!
do i need to be in good shape? no. the level of activity varies depending on the trip. however, anyone who can get in and out of the dingy and go for short walks will do fine. we have had mobility-impaired guests having wonderful cruises with us without ever leaving the boat! there are many beautiful things to see right from the cabin and deck!
what do your trips include? all onboard meals, including select wines with most dinners. on some trips you will cover one dinner ashore. your heated cabin includes a bed made with sheets, pillows, comforters, and blankets. towels, cloths, shampoo, and soap are also complimentary. you are welcome to use the inflatable, kayak, and all fishing, crabbing, and shrimping gear. if you prefer to overnight at a place with moorage fees, you are responsible for them, as well as any fishing licenses, and most off boat tours.
how often do we get off the boat? rainforest  we typically take the dinghy up a pristine river and go for a short walk, or explore a remote beach, or abandoned native village. in the san juans and gulf islands many forest trails, beaches, and country roads await the happy wanderer.
what can i expect to learn? opportunities for education abound. your skipper is a trained naturalist, and enjoys pointing out a special plant, and its traditional uses, or identifying an animal and explaining its habits. local history and native culture are other subjects you'll learn about. the captain also enjoys teaching sailing to anyone interested. our trips in the great bear and the inside passage incorporate native guides who will lead you through abandoned village sites, and enthrall with tales of battles, ancient customs, and the history of the once mighty kwakwak’wakw. or take part in a traditional open fire salmon bake and learn of the rich past of the heiltsuk. the boat makes a great platform for seminars and workshops. we also offer instructor-led cruises in subjects such as meditation, photography, and whale observation. please see charter options. if you are an instructor interested in leading an art cruise feel free to contact us.
what areas do you charter in? our scheduled tours focus in the san juans april through july, with one trip up the inside passage/southern great bear rainforest in early august, mid august to mid september in the northern great bear rainforest of the northern b.c. coast, and one trip down the inside passage/southern great bear rainforest in mid september. please see our schedule. any time you don’t see a scheduled trip booked the boat is open and available, so don’t hesitate to inquire.
what if i'm a solo traveler who prefers my own stateroom? all of our rooms are double occupancy (view ship schematic), and allow for a maximum of six guests. if you prefer a private stateroom we will try to accommodate you. there will be an additional 50% fee if the tour is otherwise full.
can you take more than six passengers? by coast guard regulation, we can take up to six guests. on our instructional cruises, and with workshops and seminars, we can bring an instructor in addition to the six guests.
do i need to know how to sail? no. the captain and crew are perfectly capable of taking care of all sailing. however, you are welcome to participate at any time for your own enjoyment. the captain is a lifetime sailor, and would love to help you with your sailing skills. by the end of the trip you may just be ready for the america’s cup!
