what happens… 




    voices
  



“the him conference gave me something life-giving to look forward to every day in a new, fresh way. every aspect of the conference spoke to my personal growth, self awareness and staying teachable.”“after a year like 2020, the world needs hope. i’ve started listening to the word daily and just showing up. that’s a huge change” for me“like a phoenix, we’ve risen from the ashes of a very tough year and celebrated anew god’ goodness and blessings in our lives.”
