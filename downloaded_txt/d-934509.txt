 below videos compare between the method of the patent (left videos) to the conventional technology (right videos) 

 

an adapter of 9 volts is powering the bottom motor in each video to demonstrate a turbine. the model has two settings that can be
 
replaced with one simple change, in order to reduce as much as possible other variables that may affect the results. the generator is 
 
located inside

        

the hollow cylinder that can move up and down along its axle  -  and to be locked ?

 according to the selected setting.
 
the output power in voltages (v) and milliamperes (ma) from the generator (dc) is seen in each video on the left side of the device.
