christmas history

 the earliest recorded reference to the birth of jesus christ and the feast is found in the roman chronographs of 354 when the birth of the lord was celebrated as part of epiphany. interestingly the earliest recorded versions seem to indicate that the feast was a commemoration of christâs baptism and not birth. 

        historians believe that christ was born sometime in between the 7th century b.c. and 2nd century b.c. in the olden days the feast was commemorated on january 6th. it was only in the 4th century that the western christian church placed the date of celebration on december 25th. christmas heralds the beginning of christmastide. the history of christmas is still shrouded in mystery, though it is widely believed that the son of god "jesus christ" was born on this day. the feast is celebrated across the world as symbolic of the triumph of 'good over evil'.
