          information 
the 
          national alliance against christian discrimination (naacd, inc.) is 
          a nationwide effort to monitor and speak out against anti-christian 
          bias, bigotry, intolerance, defamation, and discrimination towards bible 
          believers. we are a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) educational and 
          religious organization.
 this 
          alliance is committed to achieving its goals through the press, petitions, 
          letters, the voting booth, the court system, and thereby being persistent 
          in the use of legal and moral persuasion because of the growing hostility 
          by the media, intellectual elite, secularists, and the court towards 
          christianity and our religious heritage as a nation.
