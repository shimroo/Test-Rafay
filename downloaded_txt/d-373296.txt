our story

for more than 200 years america’s citizens have witnessed the inauguration ceremonies of the president and vice president of the united states. from the first inauguration of george washington, in new york city, in 1789, to today, as we prepare for the 60th inaugural ceremonies, the swearing-in ceremonies represent both national renewal and continuity of leadership. as each president has offered a vision for america’s future, we reflect on the heritage of inaugurals past.
since 1901, and in accordance with the 20th amendment of the united states constitution, the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies (jccic) has been responsible for the planning and execution of the inaugural ceremonies of the president-elect and vice president-elect of the united states at the capitol. the footage shown of the swearing-in ceremony of president william mckinley on the east front of the capitol in 1901, the first inaugural planned by the jccic.
