new construction job

providing the perfect design
this was a very fun difficult build. still some retaining walls to finish but the pond is running and beautiful!!
















newly completed

lots of fun building this new water feature.
the client wanted a water feature to awe his guests while on their back deck. the waterfall cascades down the hill and then wraps around to the patio. 
















newly completed

another project
we wanted the water feature to appear as though it originated from a spring in the side of the mountain.  we wanted the water feature to start with a smaller flow at the top and increase as it cascaded down.
