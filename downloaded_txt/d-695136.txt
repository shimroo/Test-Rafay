the 
            20th air force's five wings were divided into 20 bomb groups.   
            this is the history of one of those groups. the 39th - stationed 
            on guam, the southernmost island in the marianas. the combat missions 
            they flew against japan ultimately brought them two prestigious distinguished unit citations. 
            lesser known, however, are the individual stories - some joyous, 
            some tragic - stored in the memory of each crewman.


then, 
              too, there are those on the ground that serviced the big bombers, 
              and many others whos duties it was to provide innumerable vital 
              needs that readied both the men and planes to for the next mission. 
              all these components provided by men of unflinching patriotism, 
              dedication and courage, commendably performed the tasks they were 
              called upon to do. together they contributed in great measure to 
              the victory. 
some 
              of these personal stories that have remained in obsecurity for over 
              65 years are finally revealed in this gripping and overdue history 
              ...  
hopefully, 
              one thing that will emerge from it all. when an aging veteran of 
              our group is asked by his grand-children: 
"what 
              did you do in world war ii, grampa?"
 he 
              can answer with boundless pride and satisfaction: 
"i served in the 39th bomb group." 


 









in 
            memory of the 39ers who fought
            and never came home!
