i fell in love with the alaska railroad
                (arr) after my wife and i rode it in the summer of 1986. we
                rode 
                from the anchorage station to denali national park where we backpacked
                and camped for several days. we returned to anchorage with a
                long 
                stop due to federal hours of service law. the crew had worked its
                12 hour shift and a new crew had to be sent in. not long after
                returning 
                to my home in ohio,
                 i began modeling a 12' x 16' arr ho layout in my basement. in 2018 i began working on a 16 'x 26' layout in a room over the garage.
