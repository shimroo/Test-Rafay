pro-shot live daft punk=best lights ever!





there isn't much i can say as the clips speak for themselves. daft punk has the best stage set up and visual display that any act in the past or present has ever created. it is a complete audio/visual mindblower and they are finally playing more than just a couple dates in the us! i am seeing them in seattle and then again at lollapalooza.to top that off, we are dj'ing right before the robot rockin' french filter house masters at the camp bisco festival.... ok, not really, but our friends future rock are playing a set under the name "daft rock" at camp bisco this august in new york and we are dj'ing right before them!!! last year future rock did a set as "aphex rock" which was all aphex twin tracks and this year they are playing an entire set of daft punk tunes.  we are sandwiched between juan maclean and daft rock so we are very, very excited to be playing this fantastic festival for the third year in a row. i am also extremely excited to finally get to see the bays live as they are also playing camp bisco as well as countless other bands, djs, and electronic acts.

the role of the opening dj





dj inc- warm up set for lee burridgethis dj mix is one of my favorite dj mixes ever and a major factor in that is the high level of respect i have for the understanding of the opening act's role. in this case it is dj inc and this is the second time i have posted about this particular mix (which i heard again today for the first time in ages). what to play, how to play, when to play it, these are questions that we (orchard lounge) often ask ourselves when asked to open for somebody. there are many djs (and bands as well, but i am taking the dj's stance this time...nawmsayin?) who do not alter their sound or take into account their role for the night when asked to warm up.i guess i just do not personally see the need to bang it out as hard as you can when the doors open and the headliner doesn't start for a good 3 hours, but that's just me (or is it?) in my opinion, and yes, this is all personal opinion, the opening dj that understands their role should set the tone for the evening. i personally think it is best when the vibe starts out slow and mellow and gradually picks up pace. as the room begins to fill and the drinks are flowing, the music gains momentum. those first few hours of the night make a huge difference if played properly and the crowd is properly prepped for the headlining act to hit the decks. there is no need to overpower the headliner when you are booked to warm up for them and that also can annoy the crowd who may not want to listen to 3 hours of heaviness early on. i could insert some sort of sex analogy right here but i will spare you. this set by atlanta local, dj inc, is a perfectly programmed and flawlessly mixed warm up set for lee burridge. i think the set is from 10/24/04 but i may have the dates confused. this is the first hour of the night so it is on the minimal, dubby side, a few hours before getting heavy. he uses one of my favorite big bud tracks which is not something you hear often in this style. this mix has always inspired me and influenced me in how i think when opening for a dj or band.tempo atl

a fantastic lindstrom and prins thomas mix





lindstrom and prins thomas-bbc radio one essential mix5-6-07pete tong himself says that this is a contender of the essential mix of the year and i can't see how this could not be. this installment of the dj series is simply amazing from the first track to the final minutes. the dynamic production duo from norway prove they are just as commanding of a dancefloor as they are behind the controls in the studio. lindstrom did play a live set as part of an orchard lounge night in chicago at funky buddha lounge earlier this year which was a rare appearance and a very memorable night for spencer. here he proves that with prins thomas along for the ride and doing a dj set, not a live set, it is every bit as solid. they also have a new release coming soon titled "reinterpretations" so be on the lookout for that one.tracklisting for their essential mix:al usher - her today // misericordaeroplane - aeroplane // eskimolindstrøm & solale - let it happen // azuliin flagranti - bipolar // codekno theory - devils dance // sin&soullindstrøm - musikal overtones // feedelitysneak thief g-string orchestra - my sullen mistress // klaksonytre rymden dansskola - kjappfot (pt edit) // full pupprunaway - shadows // wurstmax mohr - assonja swynja // playhousedettman vs. moroder - quicksand/utopia mash // white labelfaze action - stratus energy // white labelm-d-emm - get acidic // transmatcentrific - somebody went to detroit and all i got was the itchy hawtins // drop bass networkfleetwood mac - you make lovin' fun (trailmix) // white labelm e - rnb drunkie // golf channelwild rumpus - musical blaze up (rub & tug bitches remix) // bitches brewchairmen of the board - party // invictus(interlude) rare earth - get ready (live version) // emi/motownniagara - sangandongo part 1 // white labelsolomun & stimming - eiszauber // diynamicstill going - still going theme // dfalindstrøm - contemporary fix (bjørn torske remix) // smalltown supersoundnick chacona - mariacha // internasjonallindstrøm & prins thomas - nummer fire en (short edit)

rare kraftwerk from 1971





ikraftwerkk4: bremen radio 1971 [seidr 026]live at gondel kino, bremen, germany, june 25, 1971.i was just turned on to this amazing, extremely rare live kraftwerk recording and i wanted to share it with you. the lineup is different and includes members of neu! and has a very different sound than typical early kraftwerk. it sounds very much like can with the guitar driven lengthy krautrock jams.you can find the downloads and full album information on the bigo site:bigo worldwide website"there isn't any extra information about this unofficial release either in the liner notes or on the interweb thing - however, as you listen it becomes obvious that this is indeed a recording of the rather short-lived lineup of kraftwerk that includes michael rother and klaus dinger in its ranks! that's right - neu! as part of kraftwerk!!!"it's basically a whole cd of extended "side-long" jams in the style of the first kraftwerk albums performed in front of a small but enthusiastic audience and broadcast on bremen radio in 1971. the members of neu! really take a forward role here, with rother's guitar driving things for most of the time and sounding quite rocking, with glimpses of his future soaring melodic sound in the extended jam passages. the guitar and drums are backed up by synth and i believe organ bass, with notable exceptions of flute taking the forefront on the great version of ruckzack (from the first kraftwerk lp) and is it distorted electric violin on k4? maybe just rother taking a violin bow to his guitar strings! proto-kraftwerk and proto-neu! it's exciting stuff, and on top of that the sound quality is excellent - a professional radio recording."how has this recording not become better known over the past 35 years since it was made?! i don't know. it appears to be a newly released cdr edition with good-quality (but privately printed) packaging. maybe it has stayed in the radio bremen archives until now? if you're sceptical about the authenticity i'm sure a listen will persuade you... and hearing someone in the crowd shout "michael!" in the last second of the recording is the icing on the cake." - little bear [who shared the recording on the internet]this isn’t the motorik, some might even say monotonous, electronic sound of kraftwerk. early kraftwerk were more experimental with sounds and effects - not quite dance music.

new order- electronic studio jamming





new order- "the perfect kiss" 1985 video (full 10 minute version)i used to have this video on a mix-tape vhs compilation of random videos and live footage from the 80's and early 90's. most of it was yo! mtv raps stuff but i also had new order videos. "the perfect kiss" was directed by jonathon demme and is nothing more than the band playing live in the studio. never been one of my favorite new order songs but this video makes up for that. what i love about the video is how it shows the band playing and incorporating all of the different sounds by making it seem like they are following the steps in order to build the beat. one by one the layers continue until the end where it builds to a climax. the video is on youtube and it is the full 10 minute version which has a long jam at the end. some extremely cheesy synth effects of course but that is standard for the time. the part that always kills me are the closeup shots of peter hook's basslines. i have always loved peter hook and the tone of his bass. 20 years ago some of the bands were on a similar quest for new sounds.i highly recommend the dvd set new order released titled "item". they have so many great videos and also such an interesting history dating back to the joy division days. item has 2 dvds, one with all of their videos and the other a documentary on the band. i just watched it this week and really enjoyed it. info -herealso check out the fantastic animated video which used the track "elegia"...here

exclusive 2020 soundsystem live video!





exclusive video for silver's boogaloo!2020 soundsystem live video mp4this is a clip of the 2020 soundsystem set from sonar which is included as the second disc of the "no order" lp. 2020 soundsystem is a live act comprised of producers off of the highly regarded electronic/house label, 2020 vision recordings. label head and insanely good dj, ralph lawson, along with silver city and dubble d are 2020 soundsystem.this is what it's all about. i have been a lover of the 20:20 vision label for as long as i have been being records. always been one of my favorites and i highly respect all of the producers on that label. random factor's "convergence" was my #1 lp of the year in 2004, spirit catcher has a hot new one out, and the countless 12" blazers that they contantly put out. now the ball is rolling with having their live act, 2020 soundsystem, hit the us. they play for gigantic crowds overseas at some of the world's finest festivals and the dancefloors will explode when they come this way. i was given some live footage that i will be sharing on this site in multiple installments. i will add some to youtube but what i have linked is an mp4 clip that can be upped to a video ipod. ralph lawson, 2020 vision label head and dj/keys in 2020ss also just mixed the latest fabric mix, fabric 33. i can't stop listening to it and i think it is one of the series best mixes. www.fabriclondon.com for more infohttp://www.myspace.com/2020soundsystempurchase the 2cd set "no order" which includes the full live at sonar set.

disco biscuits with matisyahu=dub techno sh'ma?





the disco biscuits "orch theme">jam+smema yisreal w/ matisyahu" mp3as soon as i heard this i wanted to send this link to a few of you in particular!  the disco biscuits have always played interesting cover songs. from coltrane to zappa and the beastie boys but i don't think any band would, has, or ever even thought of....playing a vitual bar-mitzvah techno jam.well, sort ofwhat happened was the band was playing a festival called langerado which took place recently in florida. matisyahu, who is possibly better known for being a hasidic jew than a reggae singer, was also on the bill. the biscuits dropped into a dub style jam which apparently drew matisyahu in and ask if he could sit in.he said:"my friends and i walked over to the disco biscuits set and i just felt the fire. the music sounded so good i just wanted to rock it. i made my way up to the front and asked to sit-in. it was a magical moment, the band was on fire and i was on fire. it was super cool."they ended up playing a dubby electronic sounding jam and matisyahu freestyled over it all. he sounded great with the band and i can only imagine how the crowd must have felt. the interesting part of his improvisational vocal stylings was his hook....shema yissssssssssssraeeeeeellllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!saying those words in the same paragraph as "techno", "jamband", and of course "disco biscuits" is something that just wouldn't happen, let alone seeing it live.more on the disco biscuits
