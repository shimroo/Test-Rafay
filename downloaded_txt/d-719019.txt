"one of the best experiences i've had in my life was taking my son, jaden, to the heartland hockey camp, in minnesota. it's a boy's dream - all mud and smells and mosquitos. but they have a great rink, for 7 days, fathers skate with their sons. you live in a dorm with them. we are going back only this year were getting a tree house" - david boreanaz, hollywood actor & star of the tv show "seal team"












i have been coaching at heartland hockey camp for over two decades and i've thoroughly enjoyed every experience. i've made many new and great friendships over the years, which has been fulfilling, but, for me, what has been most enjoyable was getting to share this experience with my daughter and son each year, ever since they were young, aspiring hockey players. hhc has impacted me and my kids in many positive ways, both on and off the ice. we cherish all of the special memories that we made at hhc! i love the energy and passion that steve and sandy bring to each of the many facets of the hhc experience, whether it be on the ice, in the fitness center, at the lake, at the bonfire, and even running the heartland mile! it's impressive to see how well hhc has expanded and improved over the years and i'm always impressed with the new experiences they add every summer to make it even better. our family is grateful to have had hhc be an impactful and lasting part of our lives and we look forward to many new experiences in the summers to come. - chris brown, head coach of the ncaa university of alaska-fairbanks hockey team
