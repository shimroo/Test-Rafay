        when times are tough, youth workers are there.

please help
youthaction ni be there to support
﻿young people this winter



 
      right now, young people are struggling more than ever







 
     anxiety, loneliness and mental health challenges are on the rise and significantly impacting the lives of young people and their communities.add the cost of living crisis, widespread food poverty, demands of schoolwork and challenging experiences within the online world and it all adds up to life being really tough.at youthaction northern ireland, we know that young people need trusted adults they can depend on, who are not teachers or parents, in their lives. our specialist youth workers support thousands of young people every year, offering a listening ear and guidance as trusted adults.in the last year, youth action northern ireland has supported more than 5500 young people.

 this year, for the first time, we are asking for your help directly.your donation will support our life-changing work with young people this winter.  every donation will help our youth workers light the way to a brighter future for more local young people in need of our support.


  






 
      when life is tough, a youth worker can make the critical difference that will help a young person have hope and a positive direction.







 
     new paragraph

 an estimated 50,000 young people across northern ireland are materially deprived, meaning families cannot afford to provide for basic needs, heating, fresh food or clothing.(action for children research 2023)young people who attend our projects tell us they are concerned about the cost of living and access to services. they share their experiences of poverty and how it reduces their opportunities.  it also impacts on their mental health and in some cases this can lead to risk taking behaviours."a participant from our programme shared his challenges this winter. he is a carer for his mum and provides her with support for 2 younger siblings.  he feels intense pressure to get a job to provide and 'be the man of the house'. 
he cant access public transport as it is a choice between that buying food and topping up the heating. his mental health is on the decline and he is only 17 years old."belfast project worker
