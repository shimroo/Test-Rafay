intelligence is the torch of wisdom 



delta sigma theta sorority, incorporated was founded on january 13, 1913, by 22 collegiate women at howard university to promote academic excellence and provide assistance to those in need. the founders of delta sigma theta envisioned an organization committed to sisterhood, scholarship, service, and addressing the social issues of the time. since its founding, delta sigma theta has become one of the preeminent service-based sororities, with more than 350,000 initiated members and over 1,050 chartered chapters worldwide.as a sisterhood comprised primarily of black, college-educated women, the sorority seriously considers the issues impacting the black community and boldly confronts the challenges of african americans and, hence, all americans. over the years, a wide range of programs addressing education, health, international development, and the strengthening of african american families have evolved. the major programs of the sorority are based upon the five-point programmatic thrust: economic development, educational development, international awareness and involvement, physical and mental health, and political awareness and involvement.
