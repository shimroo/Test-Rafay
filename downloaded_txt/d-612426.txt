quotes



wil is a cynics cynic, but in the depths of his filthy black heart he hasnt forgotten how to love. or how to write. 
mike daisey, monologuist (how theater failed america) and author (21 dog years: doing time @ amazon.com ) 

forbis has that rare thing, an open mind, with tons of random stuff flowing through it, and a crows eye for the glittering oddities of pop culture.
john richardson, author my father the spy, in the little world  

if any sense is going to be made of a culture dominated by  violent movies, noisy music and silly tv shows, its going to come from guys like wil forbis who like violent movies, noisy music and silly tv shows. 
    john saleeby, contributor national lampoon, classic rock magazines. 
  wil forbis is the triple threat of the internet, and anyone whos writing online should be watching their rearview mirror in white-knuckled panic for the lunatic generalissimo of the website no one wanted to know existedacid logic.
  steve anderson, columnist reel advice from the video store guy
  
"take one part rolling stones lester bangs with two parts national lampoons michael odonoghue and stir in a swizzle stick of salon.coms cintra wilson, and you have the intoxicatingly addictive cocktail that is wil forbis."  
earl horlyck, sioux city weekender
"...the most entertaining book ive read all year. forbis juxtaposition of subtlety, cynicism, and over the top ranting (not to mention his penchant for asking his interview subjects truly interesting questions) makes for a dizzying ride through the annals of pop culture..." 
    
rich evans, exotic magazine

reviews



a quarter past four			  

sioux city weekender "forbis' tribute to a jazzier time is more lounge than it is supper club and more a dank, after hours juke joint than the copa."
midwest record "spiff up those spats, wax your mustache and give the guy at the door the secret password. this set is a riot. "

 roctober magazine "should be called wil eightbus, because this collection of swinging cocktail jump blues jazz... is twice as good as what they did before!"




			shadey's jukebox 

listen local @ berkley sound episode 1 (podcast) "...a fuckin' a!"
rocktober magazine"...these scoundrels put together some fine lyrics, solid chops, and good intentions, and end up with some super solid, sometimes funny/sometimes sad honky tonkers."
reviewer magazine "forbis, showing his chops as a musician and singer-songwriter, depicts the american tapestry through this eclectic album."
the country chart "...a solid effort by one of the most interesting california musicians to ever enter the alt-country music scene."
maverick (uk print mag) "5 out of 5 stars... superb material performed well."
country jukebox (german web site) "an exciting fusion of straightforward traditional country and handmade bluegrass, jazz, rock and pop"
midwest record "wonderful, crazy stuff... not a diamond in the rough, it's a left field hit waiting to happen."
billy's bunker music reviews "country gone beautifully wrong."
san diego troubadour "...forbis has some definite songwriting chops."
diskant.net "the music here is a combination of swingin’ croon, hick bluegrass and country   twang – ...nothing could really be more american."
far west almanac "... pitch perfect ballads and rockers... with the panache of 1970s pop rock..."
