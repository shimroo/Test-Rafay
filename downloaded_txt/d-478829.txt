							our mission
							
							
						
the nyc employment & training coalition (nycetc) works to ensure that every new yorker — especially those who have been historically marginalized and disenfranchised and cut off from workforce opportunities — has access to the skills, training, and education needed to thrive in the local economy, and that every business is able to maintain a highly skilled workforce.













our values
access and equity: ensure talent gains the skills to access quality jobs that include a living wage and basic benefits, career building opportunities, stable and predictable scheduling, and safety and security.
market-driven talent development: build strong ties with the business community, city and state government, and philanthropy to invest in employment pathways that grow a diverse & expanded workforce in the ‘new’ new york city economy.
