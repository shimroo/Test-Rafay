 yep, it's a farewell tour. on sale now at murderbydeath.com/tourit's been grand but we've been on tour for 25 years and we are gonna give the road life one last hurrah before it grinds us into dust. after this tour, we plan to continue our cave shows so we can have a way to meet up once a year, but that's it.we are currently in the studio pouring ourselves into a new album- stay tuned for more this spring! but after that, not sure about new music, who knows? we just haven't ever taken a break and i think we need to call it a day and try to have a normal workload. i'd rather go out at our best.come celebrate 25 years of mbd with us at these gigs. we do not intend to add any additional shows, other than a few summer fests tba soon. for shows where we are doing two nights in your city we will be doing two different sets. here's a little thing i wrote. ----this band has always been a jumble of contradictions- on the one hand we've had a long-running career where we got to make art for a living, but on the other we have always eluded any kind of traditional success. we weren't covered much in the press, we never had a song that had a lot of radio play, nothing ever went viral, we didn't have a big social media presence, we never played a good festival spot where there was a sea of people in the audience, not once opened an arena or even a big shell auditorium show or tour. we constantly lost opportunities because of the band name, and were somehow always treated like nobodies or yesterday's news by most of the industry- but you, you gosh dang wonderful audience, managed to keep us growing and we never had a career slump. when we were our busiest- playing over 200 shows a year- we were chronically underpaid and always barely scraping by. but people kept writing us or telling us how much we mattered, and kept showing up, and we started to believe it a little. and then over the years we grew to a more manageable place and it seemed possible to carve out a niche in this massive, mean world of entertainment.when i reflect on how good our career was and how lucky we were, i'm left with just gratitude for the small team of folks who have worked with the band and this grassroots fan following that has lifted us up the entire time. i feel like we owe any and all our success to you. i never called us diy, despite taking on much of the work ourselves, because there are always people behind the scenes helping: it takes a village. thank you to the promoters, clubs, bands, managers, agents, artists, publishers, lawyers, publicists, crews etc etc etc who believed in us and everyone who made this work for so long. an enormous thank you to those of you who helped us through the many difficult periods. thank you for your relentless support, your passionate listening, your generosity... it's been the honor of my life to write, record, sing and perform for you. excited to see you all on this last trip out. - adam & mbd farewell poster design by erica williams--------------we've added some extra items leftover from the stanley shows to our webstore at store.murderbydeath.com also check out our patreon - we plan on adding a ton of exciting stuff this year, so don't miss out on special updates and posts about the tour and our forthcoming album.
