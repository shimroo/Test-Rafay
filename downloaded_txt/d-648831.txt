our heartfelt thanks…



august 31, 2023dear friends of full moon farm,this announcement has been a year in the making.as of today, full moon farm is no longer acting as a rescue and sanctuary. all our animals have been placed at other facilities, or retained by me. (texla, age 14.)we will be providing educational services until the end of the year. all donations will be disbursed to the organizations listed below. all assets will be disbursed according to our by-laws and state/federal regulations, and the corporation will be dissolved. it has been a great 21.5 years, but it is time to move on. my cancer scare in 2021 made me realize just how much i had given up to run the rescue. however, with a glad heart i trudged on. although three folks stepped up to take over, all three moved on to other ventures, with my blessing.i humbly ask that you continue to support our sister organizations that opened their hearts to our animals. please make an appointment to see and sponsor your favorites!tigers for tomorrow, tax id - 65-0934641, 708 cr 345, attalla, al 35954www.tigersfortomorrow.orgwolf haven ridge, tax id – 87-3544255, 2008 sugar tree br. rd., wallingford, ky 41093  www.wolfhavenridge.orgred riding hood rescue project, tax id – 87-3739849, 6955 shurz rd. middletown, oh 45042  www.rrh-project.com joyous howls from the mountain,nancynancy laportafmf board of directors
