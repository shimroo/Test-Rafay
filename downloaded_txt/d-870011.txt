health isn’t one-size-fits-all. 



dr. bessent is on a mission to redefine what “healthy” looks like. we’re ditching the tired one-size-fits-all approach to health and putting the focus where it should be– on our dogs and cats. using hand-picked herbs, targeted antioxidants, and signature nutrients, we can curate the bowl to focus on a personalized approach to health.
