still profoundly moved by the soul song you created for me. from the moment i received it, it became a part of my daily life—i’ve listened to it every single day since. each time i hear it, it touches something deep within me, offering a new perspective and helping me connect with my inner strength in ways i didn’t know were possible. your gift has been transformative. the song feels like a guiding light, reminding me of my own heart power, especially during challenging moments. i draw energy and inspiration from it, and it has truly become a source of healing and empowerment in my life. i am deeply grateful to both of you for sharing your gift with the world. your ability to touch people’s souls is extraordinary, and i want to encourage you to keep doing this beautiful work. you are making a difference in more ways than you probably realize, and i feel so fortunate to have experienced that. please keep spreading these incredible soul songs, as they have the power to change lives—just as mine has been changed. thank you again from the bottom of my heart for the love, care, and intention you pour into your work. i feel honored to have crossed paths with you. christiana     you presented me with the most beautiful song about my journey, the suitcase, the butterflies, the pausing & reflecting… it resonated so deeply with me. my email is above / thank you for sharing your gifts with us. melissa      i am so grateful for the song, i listened to it and loved it, i truly feel it was my mom telling me these things as i later reflected and did remember asking her days before the song if she was in any way proud of me, and the song lyrics confirmed it.  angelica     i pulled the past life forward and did a massive healing around my heart and grief. i also had my healing team revive the fairy to integrate and live out the energy through this timeline. i kept seeing her hard and lifeless. now she is vibrant and playful! and i wait for my partners integration with his dragon,  which includes is part of me letting go of the masculine roll  in the household and allowing him to tune into his divine masculine roll to hold space for me and us. it’s a dance, but we are on our way. thank you so much for such a beautiful witness and healing. angelica     when i got home i heard the song about 10 times and analyze everything. i cried so much and every time i listen to it, i get so emotional.   i wanted to take my fiancé to the event today but it was sold out. you guys have a beautiful gift and i’m so glad my energy was so drawn to you guys because i will keep this beautiful memory in my heart forever. stephannieh     i have been feeling great since my soul song. i have been singing the first two lines or so to myself over and over again. your song really gave me confirmation for a lot of ideas that i’ve been grappling with internally. without saying too much, i spent the first thirty years of my life trying to get my family to understand just how painful my childhood had been. the breakthrough has come in not requiring their agreement just trusting my own experience. your song very much confirms that for me. also the line, “just shine, you are enough” is literally all i have ever wanted to hear. lydia    once you have received your soul song recording after the session, let its melody guide you: meditate on its essence to connect deeper with your inner self; play its corresponding music for healing and balance; repeat it as a chant for inner peace and alignment; sing it aloud to express your soul’s authentic voice; use its vibrations
