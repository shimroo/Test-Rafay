queries

*********



the following queries will be posted to the wharton society site. if you have any information, please reply to the list or to whartonqueries@gmail.com



********



hello:



i'm an author specializing in the history of espionage. i'm currently working on a project that has somehow taken me a bit far afield. i'm trying to track down the story that edith wharton intervened for maj. ralph van deman in his efforts to establish a military intelligence division during world war i. 



denman's memoirs mention a "lady authoress" who traveled in the same social circles as the secretary of war, baker, but offer no other details. 



i was hoping that perhaps she might have made mention of maj. deman or baker in her diaries.  the date would have been around 1917, just prior to america's entrance into wwi. 



needless to say, any assistance you might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated. 



best regards,

henry r. schlesinger
