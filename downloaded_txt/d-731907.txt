last edited: 22nd april 2021

this cookie policy explains how eschools use cookies and similar technologies in our services. it explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control their use.

what are cookies?
cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, eschools) are called “first party cookies”. cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). the third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.


why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?
we use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our services to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” cookies. other cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our services, and we refer to these as “advertising” or “analytical” cookies. for example, the embedding of youtube and vimeo videos, as added by individual schools, will require “advertising” cookies  to be enabled in order to successfully play them. schools that, for example, opt to track visitor data using google analytics will require “analytical” cookies to be enabled in order to do so. these third party cookies are used to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalise your experience while interacting with our services and to otherwise improve the functionality of the services we provide. we also enable schools to employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in connection with their use of our services in order to allow them to track visitors to and interactions with their school website.
