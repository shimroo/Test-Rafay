                    welcome to my website. 
                    i love writing for children, and enjoy sharing my passion
                    for 
                    books with others. come on in, look around, and stay a while.  
               
                    
















 
                      




































































      





 in college, while
                    studying to be a
                    preschool teacher, i took a course
                    in childrens
                    literature. i remember
                    the day i fell in
                    love with childrens
                    books. i knew at that moment that
                    some day i would
                    write picture books. while working to become
                    published, i discovered
                    a passion for nonfiction as
                    well. now i write both. 
                     
                    
i often visit schools to share my love of books and
                    writing with children.
                    i also enjoy speaking to adults at conferences and
                    workshops. find out more about
                    me, my
                    books,  and my author
                    visits.


when i'm not writing or visiting schools, i may be
                    getting together with
                    my long time writing group and dear friends, the
                    write sisters. otherwise, you will
                    find me working in my
                    garden or feeding the birds in my yard.

corduroy

 
by don freeman
1968
don freeman is probably best known for his book corduroy, the
        delightful story of a department store teddy bear who longed to be
        loved. however, freeman wrote and illustrated many other books besides corduroy, as well
as co-authored some with his wife lydia. he also illustrated a number of books
by other authors. here are some of his other titles from my collection. 
how many do you remember?
