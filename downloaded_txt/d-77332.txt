nick carter's taig lathe and milling machine pages
 welcome to my pages devoted to the taig lathe and
taig milling machines! 
i have been using taig equipment in
my own shop for over fourteen years and i am an enthusiastic fan of the
taig
lathe and milling machines (both the manual and cnc versions), their
economy, capability and over all style. the taig micro lathe and taig
micro mill are especially good if you are a novice to metalworking, and
seek to learn the basics without a large investment of money and space.
these pages are a useful resource for all taig lathe and milling
machine users, with technical support, project ideas, articles,
pictures and links to all pages on the internet. updated march 1st, 2024
