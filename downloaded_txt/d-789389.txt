eagle cap campers



in the spring of 2022, and with much tenderness, we announced an indefinite pause to eagle cap production, commencing with the wrap-up of model year 2022 production. this decision was made in an effort to streamline manufacturing to meet the ever-increasing demand for our adventurer and scout product lines. we know many of our customers have grown to love eagle cap, and we are thankful for all the support from our community, at adventurer manufacturing, we understand the sentimental value that the eagle cap camper line holds. over the past 10 years, eagle cap has evolved to become a highly sought-after product, leading the way in the high-end camper market. our team of experienced engineers and designers continue to pour their hearts and souls into creating innovative and high-quality campers that embody our passion for adventure and exploration. we are confident that our existing and future product offerings will provide you with the comfort, convenience, and durability that you need to make your next outdoor adventure a success.warranty and servicing for all actively registered eagle cap units will continue to be fully supported, with uninterrupted coordination between adventurer manufacturing and its network of north american dealers.
