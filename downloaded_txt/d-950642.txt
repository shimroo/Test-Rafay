our storyfounded in 1987 in idaho’s snake river valley, the estate vineyards surrounding sawtooth winery were once rich pastures owned by charles pintler. the pintlers saw a greater potential in the steep, south sloping hills, and set out to grow wine grapes. sawtooth estate winery and the snake river valley have gained increasing national acclaim for varietals such as riesling, pinot gris, syrah, merlot and tempranillo with winemaker meredith smith leading its program. inside every bottle of sawtooth lies the spirit of adventure, the mystique of idaho, and the natural beauty that rests within the snowcapped mountains and crisp, clean rivers of the snake river valley.






















 

our vineyardsas the most significant grower of wine grapes in the snake river valley, the 70-acre sawtooth estate and the 400-acre skyline vineyard provide a sought after source of quality grapes not just for sawtooth winery, but also for some of idaho’s most acclaimed winemakers.
