        light-sport aircraft
    

whether you're completely new to aviation or are already an experienced pilot, light-sport aircraft (lsa) and the corresponding sport pilot certificate make flying easier, more affordable, and more accessible - not to mention fun! 
the sport pilot certificate enables new pilots to learn to fly half the time and for half the cost of previous alternatives, while existing pilots can transition to a simpler world of recreational flying that’s free from hassles and red tape. 
the lsa category encompasses a wide variety of aircraft including two-seat ultralight-type designs and powered parachutes, antiques and classics, and the latest composite aircraft. whether you want to buy or build, you’ll find an aircraft that’s right for you!

            first real cross country flight
