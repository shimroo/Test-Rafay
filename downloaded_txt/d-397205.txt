about us
 















calvary ballardwe are a diverse group of people who have been united as family through the grace of jesus christ. we hope to see the love and grace that has transformed our lives shown to our neighbors in the ballard community and all of seattle.the way we seek to accomplish this is by actively serving in our community and telling our neighbors about jesus. all are welcome at our church and we would love to have you join us, meet us, and if you haven’t already: meet jesus. our story is a unique one, nothing short of ordained and we continue to watch it unfold.
