                                            if you thought that hiking, biking, and watching a concert all in the same place was impossible, think again. when you come to boulder, visiting red rocks is a must. you can hike the trails and bike the terrain, and in the evening, come back to the red rocks amphitheater. the venue is literally in the middle of the mountains and unlike anything you’ve ever seen.
