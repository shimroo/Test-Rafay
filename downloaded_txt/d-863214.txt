by the community, for the community.with over a hundred active volunteers presenting and producing live radio for the diverse communities of manchester, our ethos is ‘by the community, for the community’.  our presenters & producers have been trained by all fm, presenting a range of shows, including foreign language shows, shows by and for carers, those with mental health issues, disabilities, older people and younger people and all those in between. we believe that everyone should have a voice. so, each year we train over one hundred new people, from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences to go live on all fm 96.9. in 2020 we received ‘the queen’s award for voluntary service’. the previous year at national community radio awards, we were awarded ‘radio station of the year’.
