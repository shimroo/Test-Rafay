she is definitely k's sister!



one day k decided he was going to help mommy and clean out the hall  closet.  he wanted "rocks" so he could have more wii time!  so  intentions weren't necessarily to help mommy but for his own benefit.   :)  hey,  i'll take it!  in the process, a2 found lots of fun  accessories.  it was really hot that day.  i went outside to see what  the kids were up to and this is what i found.  silly girl!  she was so  happy in her sassy's winter hat, k's flip flops and her gloves.  i  didn't get a picture of the gloves on.  she was quite the looker!she was also running around the yard "picking flowers".  :)

c graduates from elementary



i still can't believe we have a middle schooler in our house.  mom, is a bit scared for him.  lockers, class schedules, sports, more rude kids, homework!  ok, mom is scared for herself too!  c is a very introverted child.  he hates standing in front of a crowd and having to face them. it makes him very nervous and uncomfortable.  i was so proud of c!  he did a great job getting up in front of 175 of his classmates families, perform a song and walk across the stage to get his certificate/diploma thingy.  you can tell in the picture above he wasn't thrilled about it............ until he had that baby in his hand.  he immediately sat down and flashed mom a big c smile!  i love him!now don't get me wrong, i am very proud of him and his accomplishments.  he finished the year with straight a's!  i'm beyond proud and believe they deserve to be recognized but i think the full on elementary graduation is ridiculous.

mom!  how much does glass cost?



yes.... this is the question i get from k at 6:50am while waiting for the school bus.  i knew this wasn't good!  i walked outside and discover k was trying to prove to c that he could throw rocks further.  we now know that maybe not farther but definitely harder.as you can see, ( i couldn't tell until later in the morning) the rocks he threw went right threw the window.  found the rocks on the inside. we also now know that safety glass does what it's suppose to.  it shattered into thousands of tiny pieces but i held in place nicely.  unfortunately, this was the first of may and of course, it thunderstorms almost every afternoon.  when i called the window replacement company, the gentleman advised me to call my insurance but do not tell them that my 8 year old did this; to just say i woke up and found my van this way.  well, our insurance agent is a member of our ward and a good friend.  i talked to him and he couldn't believe that k actually did this.  but he said we had comprehensive coverage with no deductable.  phew... k's butt was saved.  our prayers were answered.  i didn't have to come up with a $300 that day but i still wasn't happy with k.

k's 8 year pics



amy is still "training" me to work under her.  here are some pics i took of k for his baptism program and such.  i was so pleased with how they turned out.  loved the location!  and it makes it easy when you have a kid that really doesn't mind having his picture taken and can give you that "right" smile almost every time!  he is quite the photogenic child!a little too posed for my taste but he was so silly and really getting into it by the end.  ha ha!

it's great to be 8!



wow! what a weekend!  k will have quite the 8th birthday to remember!  his birthday and baptism fell on easter sunday.  how many of us can say our baptism day is our birthday and easter?  he was pretty excited about how it all came together. it is such a blessing to have an 8 year old in the family again.  it's such a gift to me as a parent to sit and listen to our child know what it means to be baptized  and want it for himself as much as i want it for him.  g'ma c gave the talk on baptism.  she was asking k a lot of questions, and i sat back amazed about how much he knows the doctrine and history of the church. i'm so blessed to be married to a honorable man that holds the priesthood.  it's moments like these that remind myself of why we are here on earth, to redirect what's important and to take the time really remember them.  it's also these moments that i feel like i'm doing my job as a parent.  that i am doing some good in my child's lives.  we are so proud of k and his decision to become a member of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints! k has been counting down the days until he got his own scriptures and new bag.  no joke!  he was so looking forward to this moment almost as much as the actual baptism.it feels great to have so many people love your children!   thank you all for making k's weekend such a memorable one!

k turns 8!



k requested a rising sun for his birthday cake.  he wanted it because it was on his karate uniform.  something he really enjoys right now.so a little background as to why k likes the minnesota vikings.  the year k was born cheeto bought me some steelers silk capri pajama pants for christmas.  i loved them and hinted i would like another pair.  so for mother's day he got a couple new ones.  the only problem was he couldn't find them for the carolina panthers or steelers then.  so he bought me texans, because my little sister was serving a mission in texas at the time and i do like the color (red, white and blue).  the other pair he got me was the vikings because i do love the color purple.  k took it that mom like the vikings so he sided with me and just decided to start liking the vikings too.  and it has stuck.  even though cheeto is not much of a vikings fans, he does allow his children to chose who the like and allows such things in our home.  :) nothing better than a itunes card. the friend i work with that is a photographer has great kids and our kids love them around.  she came to the party and was more than willing to take pics.  this was awesome because just like most mom's out there, we are the ones behind the camera and never in the pictures.  that just explains why i'm in the some of these.  i was working on cutting and serving the cake.  cheeto was being cute and posed for amy, re-enacting a "cutting of the cake" moment. and this time he took advantage of the fact i wasn't dressed in a white wedding dress and did what he probably really wanted to do almost 13 years ago.  :)  it was funny and love him for it!
