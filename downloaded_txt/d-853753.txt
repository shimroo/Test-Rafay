we
offer a full range of courses from basic sailing lessons through ocean training cruises
on island packet yachts in chesapeake bay and the atlantic ocean
between delaware bay,  norfolk and bermuda. we also teach  docking practice
classes and live online
coastal navigation, celestial navigation and electronic navigation classes. students can
earn certification from the american sailing association (asa). located
near rock hall, md on the eastern shore of chesapeake bay.
we have been a blue water ocean sailing school since 1993 when we conducted our first
ocean training cruise on a 1500 mile non-stop atlantic ocean cruise from st thomas directly to norfolk where students were able to learn open ocean sailing in the real world environment of blue water off shore sailing. since then, we have conducted over
300 advanced coastal and ocean training cruises of between 400 and 1500 miles each, and have become established as a recognized ocean sailing academy. our ocean captains are true
sailing masters with many years of ocean sailing experience on boats under 100 feet and
with uscg master licensing... come sail with us!
