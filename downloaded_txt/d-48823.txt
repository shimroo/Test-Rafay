college student scholarship


 farm to farm staff exchange scholarship
 nafdma values connections and life-long relationships which can guide a farm on its agritourism journey.  to that end, the nafdma scholarship fund supports staff/internship exchanges between member farms both conceptually and financially.  the individual who experiences the new environment of the farm and the farm who accepts a staff person from another farm both have valuable take-aways from the experience. 
·       the individual is able to experience operations and develop ideas from their extended time on the host farm.
·       the individual experiences a variety of management styles.
·       the host farm has a short-term employee who understands the farm experience.
·       the host farm is able to consider new business case ideas.
·       both entities have a transfer of good ideas and the foundation for starting or continuing a relationship.
