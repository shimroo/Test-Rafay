digital euro

a digital euro would be a digital form of central bank money, specifically the euro. it could be used by the general public in much the same way as cash, only in virtual form. alongside cash, the eurosystem would thus supply households with an additional form of central bank money that can be used quickly, easily and securely.

nagel: additional financing needs to fund the economic transition seem manageable 

14.02.2025


i am confident that our financial system can mobilise the necessary financing, bundesbank president joachim nagel said in a speech at the adam smith business school in glasgow, where he talked about the financing for the transition to a greenhouse gas-neutral economy. he also elaborated on what the potential financing mix to fund the transition might look like. furthermore, nagel emphasised the need for a strong banking system and improved access to capital market financing.

ecb selects motifs for future euro banknotes

31.01.2025


the governing council of the ecb has shortlisted the motifs for the two possible themes for future euro banknotes: “european culture: shared cultural spaces” and “rivers and birds: resilience in diversity”. the selected motifs include ludwig van beethoven, marie curie and leonardo da vinci. “rivers and birds” included a kingfisher in a waterfall, a white stork flying over a river valley and a wallcreeper next to a mountain landscape. the ecb is expected to make the final decision on the designs of the new banknotes in 2026.
