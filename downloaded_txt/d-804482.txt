mike garcia construction






as a principal and manager of projects for richard l. bowen + associates inc. for 26 years, i have had the pleasure of working with citadel contractors over the past 15 years on multiple projects. as an architectural and engineering firm with various client types, i would have to say that working with national retail developers can present some demanding challenges for architects and contractors. citadel contractors was involved as the tilt-up contractor on several of our large retail projects and provided outstanding construction services to our clients. additionally, they provided value-added recommendations and suggestions through the juxtaposition of panels, patterned liner panels, and the use of brick, stone, and concrete reveals to produce a depth of architecture not normally thought of when considering tile-up as a construction solution. citadel’s attention to detail and timeliness is commendable and noteworthy, as evidenced by the outstanding work that represents our design intent.
i would recommend citadel contractors on any construction project that requires their type of service, as they are professionals in the work they perform. i look forward to working with citadel contractors in the future.
