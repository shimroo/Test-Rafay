mic lowrey:the making of "intro"



this is a blog about the struggle and hardship; as well as the inspiration for the creation of my debut hip hop album: "intro" and other random ideas of sex,porn, culture and politics,with a splash of tech and lifestyle talk.

i have not posted





it has been a very long time since i posted something on the net, been busy with the businesses that is all, eye style music is still a go and the release of some material is very much the only thing on the menu for right now. eye style (promo) is trying to make it do what it do and the other businesses are going as well. i am going to start to be on here more with my music, so, "intro" may be on included in my new effort. "the gucci selections" i have been working on this for some time and i think it is the right thing to do, so instead of giving you 7 joints, it will be a little more.i am working on an ambitious project as well, called, iron mic, that is me over the classic ghostface killah album, iron man, using the instrumentals of that album, skits and all, so i may be working with my guys on this, if they are up to the game or i may enlist some others, another thing i am working on is spit: volumes 1-3 which each serve there own purpose volume 1 is a retrospective, older joints that i love redone, so inspect a little kwame, kid n play, slick rick, biz markie, big daddy kane, kool g rap, krs one, ll cool j, scareface, chill rob g (hometown), and rakim, volume 2 is more spit orientated it called the cognitive art, that is basically me going in, it will take some time to get that, and the third is sung, that is me singing some of my favorite tunes, yeah i said singing, like kanye did with 808, but not the roger troutma (t pain) voice thing just me
