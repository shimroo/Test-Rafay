	 today was a good day
	 
    


i’ll be on honest, the day began as a monday which is never a good start but certainly went uphill from there.  sitting in the office around 9.30 i realised i quite fancied a game of football tonight and lo and behold i get a text 2 minutes later inviting me to play in one. i brought my coupon into the bookies at lunch and hasn’t a 50p bet on finland (sorry wales!) and serbia only gone and won me 6 glorious pounds.   just when i thought the day couldn’t get any better, free sandwiches were given out (disclaimer: the sandwiches were not bought with tarp funds) while i made my afternoon coffee. today was a good day.  i rattled a few in the top corners during football for good measure!

	 why is dublin airport a shambles...
	 
    


...because they wasted all their money buying segways for the police.  if you were going to attempt an attack on the infidels via the airport i don't think a security guard doing his best johnny 5 impression would be much of a deterrent.

	 don't tell me the score...
	 
    


i was all set for a night in to watch the republic of ireland vs. georgia. beers in the fridge? check! lots of food in the house? check! no big storyline unfolding in corrie that may cause me to be overruled as to what gets watched on the tell? check! it was all looking so good but then got roped into working late. no worries i yell,  i'll sky plus it. sweet. just need to dodge any form of new media until i get home. no looking at text messages for the lads and no listening to the radio on the train home. ipod on, nose in a book and soon i'm home for about 10pm but none the wiser of the score. phone rings as soon as i'm in the door. it's my mum. "well, are you chuffed ireland won?"

	 outside noises
	 
    


the heavy snow means there's no traffic about so the only thing you can hear outside is the shouting and screaming of the neighbours as the pelt each other with snowballs. either that or the snow zombies are back.. damn you snow zombies....damn you all to hell!!

	 school's cancelled
	 
    


i remember when school would get cancelled coz of the snow. something to do with the pipes for the heating freezing. the school janitor must've been on a retainer from the heating engineers because it would happen every year without fail: temp. drops below freezing, pipes freeze, school cancelled, ultimate snowball death match ensues until eventually all the good snow is used up, we're throwing brown sludge at each other and then the smallest kid who always cries get's hit in the eye / face / head by a particularly stone shaped bit of snow and runs home to tell. good times!
