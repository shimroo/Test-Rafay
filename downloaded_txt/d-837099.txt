midwest touches your life.











it starts with chemistry,
                but it’s really people helping people.
            
sure, we control dust and stabilize roads and keep the rails moving. beyond the benefits and aside from the innovations, we’re just a bunch of men and women, scientists and engineers, who care about health and ecology and productivity.we’re proud to be part of a company that’s dynamic, making things happen every day in so many markets in so many places. everything we do is based on science and proven by evidence. midwest isn’t a leader because we sell more or do more or have more products and trucks, but because we care more about what we do than anyone else — and we’ve had this spirit of leadership, exploration and accomplishment for 45 blessed years.



welcome to the world of helping people live and work better.
