golden_dso i was juuust getting ready to go to bed like 45 minutes ago, and was feeding the cat, when i see an ant emerging from the wall behind her food bowl. and another ant. and another, other ant. and long story short, the cat is shut in the powder room (meowing miserably, and yes, i do feel guilty) and i have bugsprayed* the hell out of the kitchen and the landing at the top of the basement stairs where we keep her bowl. and i am not sleeping anytime soon, and am probably going to drink until i forget, because i can handle one ant at a time, but when we've got colonies and shit i tend to freak the fuck out. if i seem calm, it's because you can't see me cringing.i'll let the cat out when the spray is dry, which i hope is soon. and i'll give her treats. but first i'll have to clean up the dead ants and also try and figure out where the fuck to put her food/water, because i don't want to put them back where they were in ant headquarters, but i don't want to shut her out of the basement, because that's where her litter box is (and like hell am i carrying that upstairs). probably i'll put her food in the middle of the kitchen floor, as far away from the sprayed areas as possible. we usually shut her in the basement at night because she scratches at our bedroom door if we let her stay out, but the only good place in the basement for her food is at the top of the stairs, and see above re: ant central station.right. commencing operation: drink more & try not to cry. wish me luck.*the spray we use is pet-safe after it's dried, in case anyone was wondering.

golden_dso i've had to drop out of i_reversebang, to my disappointment, and probably to my artist's, too. it's not related to her art in the least; i loved her art when i chose it and i still do. but all the ideas i had have refused to coalesce into words, and as of today i've got only 300 (handwritten!) words. my 3,000-word draft is due in a week. it's not happening. i wish it were.

golden_dsomeone please try and dissuade me from purchasing yet another skincare product, even though it is the first product i have ever found that gets rid of my perpetual under-eye dark circles and puffiness, and the fact that spending $38 for something that will probably last me at least a few months isn't that bad. i don't actually want to be one of those people with a skin cream for everything, despite what the contents of my medicine cabinet may lead you to believe.who am i kidding, i am totally going to sephora tomorrow to buy this. *sigh*

golden_dtoday i did my first 5k walk ever, on two hours' notice, at noon, 80 degree weather, in a pencil skirt and ballet flats. for some reason this feels 100% appropriate.

meme!

golden_dposted this on tumblr; thought i'd do it over here, too. :)pick any passage of 500 words or less from any fanfic i’ve written, and stick that selection in a comment. i will then give you the equivalent of a dvd commentary on that snippet: what i was thinking when i wrote it, why i wrote it in the first place, what’s going on in the character’s heads, why i chose certain words, what this moment means in the context of the rest of the fic, lots of awful puns, and anything else that you’d expect to find on a dvd commentary track.everything is linked here, and all the more recent stuff is at ao3.

three things


apr. 30th, 2013 at 12:10 am



 


golden_d1. spent some time being concerned because fern stopped scratching her post and was increasingly destroying banisters/jumping at walls/risking electrocution by pawing at outlets. turns out her post was a kitten-sized one and now that we've gotten a bigger post she's scratching at it merrily.2. last friday our receptionist quit, no notice, nothing. it's the busy season for me and my boss, so this is not good timing. we finally got a temp in this past thursday. i like her, mostly; she's probably in her early 50s, and competent enough, i guess. but she talks too damn much, and i don't know if that's just how it is, or if it's just because the remaining two people in our office have been away and there is no one else for her to talk to except me so i am the focus of all her energy. i like her, but sometimes i just want to say, go away, i am trying to work. 3. nba center jason collins came out today, making him the first active (i.e., not retired) player in a major american sport to come out. i am anxious to see how this plays out, but: this is thing that is happening, and this is an important and exciting thing. my first reaction was something like, "holy shit!" and my second reaction was, "well, shit, i better finish up the final part of the 'wait for spring' series before it gets jossed by reality." this probably says something about my priorities.

golden_dso, does anyone else ever, like, make up names for the people who you see all the time in your office building/waiting for the bus/around the neighborhood, who you maybe talk to sometimes but you don't actually know their names? like how the guy i always see walking his dogs used to be "hipster arthur" (because he looked like arthur from inception) except then i realized the "hipster arthur" is pretty much how to describe joseph gordon-levitt, so now dog-walking guy is "joe"; and one of the women who works on my floor is "lisa" because she looks like a lisa i used to work with; and one of lisa's coworkers looks kinda like duff from ace of cakes, so i call him duff; and another one is josh because if he isn't actually one of my old ta's then he bears a striking resemblance? and then there's a whole slew of people who are just "yuppie mom" and "yuppie dad" and "bike-riding dude" and "leopard-print accessories lady" and "sikh guy with the best mustache ever"?...no? just me? ok then.
