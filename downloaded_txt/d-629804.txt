its the time of the year again! christmas is almost here n who can resist the xmas decos n attractive sales promos rite? well, takashimaya had a sales last week where members get an additional 10% off. it might not sound like much but did i mention it applied to gucci too?! *sigh* talk about exclusivity. well, i tried to restrain myself but the temptation is too hard to resist...haha, its time to do some damage control...
