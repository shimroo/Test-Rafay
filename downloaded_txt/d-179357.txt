hammock accessories






dfohome.com began with one handmade hammock
before we were dfohome, we were a hammock company. they're what got us started in outdoor relaxation, and remain a major part of what we do. we're unique in that we believe there's a place for a hammock in any outdoor setting, and once you've reclined in one of our premier models, you'll be inclined to agree. take a moment to browse our collections -- you'd be surprised at the variety of hammocks we offer! most are manufactured right here in greenville, north carolina.
hammocks are generally composed either of fabric or rope. quilted hammocks are a special subcategory of fabric hammocks with added cushioning inserted between two layers of fabric. rope hammocks are available in cotton, polyester, and duracord®. duracord® is an exceptional synthetic blend of rope designed to maximize both comfort and durability against the elements. for a unique and refreshing style of hammock without spreader bars, consider south american hammocks.
