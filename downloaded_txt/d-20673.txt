garmin rino 650 review

this review will come in a few separate segments as i continue to use the rino 650.

this is my first rino but not my first garmin. i am moving from the garmin 60cs and have used it many years for hunting and wilderness hikes. i also have experience using a friends garmin 530hcx so i will make some comparisons along the way.

many of my hunts or hikes are in roadless areas with no trails and in the tall timber where landmarks cannot be seen. these conditions can really put a gps and radio unit to a test of practical functionality.

upon receiving the rino 650 new, i loaded the us topo west 24k map detail which went very smoothly. it did take about three hours to load all of washington and about a third of oregon.

at first i installed a 32gig microsd card but the rino 650 would only recognize 2 gigs.  the manual does not state the maximum card size but the faq section on the garmin website states 4 gigs. i installed a 4 gig card and the rino 650 recognized the whole 4 gigs.

i also loaded some birdseye satellite imagery from the garmin birdseye website. i loaded regular resolution for most of washington state, and high resolution for my favorite places. the 4 gig card holds my mapping and this birdseye satellite imagery with a half a gig to spare so far. there is also about a half a gig of extra space on the rino 650 that i can use if needed.  the birdseye imagery was a real asset while hunting for locating clearings, clearcuts, and estimating the age of the trees when going through timber. (older timber is a lot easier to hike through than young reprod).  the regular resolution birdseye maps show you the cuts and clearings, and the high resolution can show individual trees. 

many times i would project a waypoint of interest using the birdseye imagery (for where a clearcut begins or a brushy reprod area begins etc), and send to another rino user in the field who did not have birdseye. 

the touch screen on the rino 650 works very well.  even with water droplets on the screen it was very readable, and the touch point was accurate. the touch screen menu is very intuitive and quick. this is a clear advantage over the garmin rino 530hcx. the screen resolution is similar to the rino 530hcx but the larger size is easier on my 40+ year old eyes. there have been a few occasions when it would have been better to turn the screen a couple clicks brighter than maximum, but the maximum setting is fine 98% of the time.

when on the map screen, the rino 650 uses the entire screen to display the map. this is very helpful to see a larger area with detail.

i hunted with others who were using both the garmin rino 650 and the garmin rino 530hcx.  the units interacted very smoothly. we were able to send waypoints and texts between the units too.

more details to come soonÂ…
