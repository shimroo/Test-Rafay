exhibition
lee & lee
1 august to 31 october 4 at farleys house and gallery, east sussex, england 
‘lee & lee,’ pairs some of lee miller’s most iconic photographs with their counterparts from the highly anticipated feature film ‘lee’ ahead of the film’s release by sky in cinemas across the uk and ireland on 13th september.
the exhibition will showcase comparative images of lee miller’s wartime reportage alongside photographs by kimberley french (official photographer for lee) of meticulously researched scenes recreated for the film. additionally, it will feature photographs by lead actor and executive producer kate winslet taken on set using a rolleiflex camera, a replica of the model used by lee miller. 
antony penrose, co-director of farleys house and gallery and lee miller’s son, says ‘other attempts to make a feature film about lee had failed in the past, but this one succeeded mainly due to kate winslet’s vision and determination. it owes much of its force and integrity to being a film about a woman made by women.’

home of the surrealists
farleys house & gallery
tucked away in the sussex countryside, farleys house conjures up an extraordinary atmosphere that testifies to its position as a meeting place for the key personalities in twentieth century art. shortly after moving here in 1949, lee miller and roland penrose turned their farmhouse into an extraordinary, colourful collection of art treasures, many of which were created by their friends and visitors including pablo picasso, man ray, max ernst, paul eluard and joan miro. 
today, farleys house and gallery is a house museum, sculpture garden and home to the lee miller archives. open from april-october each year, you can tour lee and roland’s home and enjoy our programme of exhibitions, workshops and events.
