what our guest are saying



“the sandcastle is our favorite place on the coast. it's right on the beach, so you can hear the roar of the ocean. we love how you can sit in bed and watch the waves, or the stunning sunsets. we can fly kites on the beach, watch for whales, see kids enjoying the beach and baby seals catching their food as the tide comes in. of course, there's nothing better than walking in the sand, occasionally getting your feet wet, and looking for treasures. come see for yourself. the staff will make sure you are welcome and comfortable.”— mark h.



“one of my favorite places on one of my favorite beaches! it used to be a well-kept secret but now you'd better plan a few months ahead of time to stay.”— linda m.



“we love the sandcastle beachfront and will be back. love the fireplace that turns on with a light switch! i can sit by the fire and hear the ocean roaring. the beach is clean and the ocean waves crash right off the balcony practically. this motel has the best stretch of beach in the whole city. rooms are clean, pool was great, hot tub was clean. location is great--lots of restaurants in walking distance.”— lisa s.
