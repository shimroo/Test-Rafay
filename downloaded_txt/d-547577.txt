who is the umstead coalition?

our mission is to preserve the natural integrity of william b. umstead state park and the richland creek corridorthe umstead coalition was founded in 1968 and is a volunteer-led, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization comprised of individual members and 16 partner conservation organizations. since 1968, the umstead coalition has repeatedly risen to protect william b. umstead state park from threats such as quarries, a proposal to sell the park, a dry-dam flood control structure on turkey creek, rdu airport runways that would have taken park lands and a plan to build a major highway through the park and the richland creek corridor.  the umstead coalition serves as the conduit to donate funds to help william b. umstead state park. when you donate to the umstead coalition, 100% of your donations go directly to help william b. umstead state park and are tax deductible.
