urns are (custom) personalized by hand carving then hand painting
a miniature figure of your pet. you
can also have a name chip-carved in
basswood, into the top. there is a heart shaped frame for a photo.
select one, two or all three options. choose from five different
types of wood.(click here to see what
style of urn and types of wood are currently being offered).
i do not carve human figures at this time. however there are
several ways to customize/personalize an urn for a loved one based on
their interests. skis, flowers, a beloved pet, something sentimental
reproduced in miniature, as i am also a
dollhouse miniature artist. tell me
what you have in mind, as everything is completely custom made
to order.

above is a custom carved human urn, personalized with a
chip-carved unicorn.
