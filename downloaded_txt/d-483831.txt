public notice
please be advised, the village has received numerous calls of coyotes 
	roaming the neighborhood.
	here is some useful information if you come in contact with one.
**************************
    we have noticed an increase in dog waste left behind on our residential property, village right of way and our park. this is in violation of the village code.

keeping your dog on leash at all times when on walks and cleaning up after our pets is not only a matter of courtesy, but a requirement in our community. dog waste is a threat to the health of our children, attracts pests, contaminates our drinking water, and transmits disease.

	please leash, curb, and clean up after your dog.

thank you for your cooperation and assistance in keeping our community clean and enjoyable for everyone.
