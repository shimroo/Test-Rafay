ending feline homelessnessstarts with youlearn more





facilitating the trap, neuter, and return of feral and stray outdoor cats in lake county, illinois.

 

spay and stay’s goal is to connect and collaborate with compassionate individuals in lake county, illinois to humanely control the population of feral and stray cats.if you are outside of lake county please call or email a resource in your county rather than spay and stay - we have a list here: https://www.spayandstay.org/tnr-resourceswe provide veterinary resources and coaching for caretakers to trap, neuter, and return (tnr) cats in their area. spay and stay teaches trapping techniques and colony care to reduce the number of homeless kittens born and improve the lives of adult cats through sterilization and vaccination. spay and stay does not remove or relocate cats, and we are not a shelter or sanctuary.
