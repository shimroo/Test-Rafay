welcome to nightguide new orleans, your single source for nightlife information. use our guide to find the hottest places to go and have fun.

after dark, new orleans lights up with crescent city magic all its own. no amount of post-katrina hardship could put a halt to the big easy's legendary nightlife, a voo-doo embellished cornucopia of music, color, flavor, fun, excitement, and romance.  from bourbon street's neon and noise, new orleans spreads out to moonlit streets ideal for strolling, especially along banks of the mississippi. and when all that revelry -- from red hot jazz to cool blues -- calls it a night, the 24-hour café du monde awaits with coffee and beignets. 

now in rebirth mode, the inside word is that devotees valuing after-dark new orleans for the food, music, and indefatigable spirit will find things much as they've always been. dinner at galatoire's reaps the same all-out classic creole menu, with john the waiter with a 35-year tenure still at his post, despite having lost his chalmette home to katrina. clubs are hopping, although service may be slower because of staffing shortages. nola bars  standing for new orleans, louisiana -- tend to open early in the afternoon, staying open well into the wee hours.

for live music, the french quarter and faubourg marigny have dozens of bands within easy walking distance. uptown also has plenty of clubs, as does the warehouse district. bars near the corner of royal and franklin streets cater to an eclectic  crowd. palm court jazz café and preservation hall carry on with traditional jazz, and  pat o'brien's next door still reigns as a lively place to have a few. rowdier gay bars are around st. ann street in the french quarter, and the drag scene prevails on north rampart street. larry flynt's hustler club is open, as is the bourbon cowboy, hookah café, and snug harbor jazz bistro. the landmark mid city lanes rock n bowl mixes zydeco, blues, cajun and dance with action on the lanes. ray's over the river on canal street is open, as is house of blues on decatur street. also open, bourbon street's razzoo club & patio, tropical isle, utopia, krazy korner, cat's meow, red rhino, and rick's cabaret international.
