our commitment to transparent ratings and a greener future
 



at holbeck ghyll, we believe in transparency and the power of community feedback. that’s why our hotel ratings are based on reviews from trusted booking channels such as booking.com, expedia, google, and tripadvisor. these platforms provide real, unbiased insights from guests who have experienced our hospitality firsthand.we’ve chosen to move away from traditional, dated rating systems because we recognise that today’s travelers rely more on open, social proof. this approach ensures our ratings reflect the most current and genuine guest experiences.in alignment with our commitment to sustainability, the funds previously allocated to subscribing to outdated rating systems have been redirected towards environmental initiatives. these initiatives include waste reduction programs, support for local conservation efforts. we believe this not only enhances your stay but also contributes to a healthier planet.thank you for being part of our journey towards a more transparent and sustainable hospitality experience.
