what is a resin model?
a resin model is a replica 
        of an original sculpture reproduced through a process called "cold 
        casting" in which polyurethane resin is poured into a rubber mold 
        and allowed to harden at room temperature. the resin dries to form a cast 
        or multiple casts designed to be assembled and painted by hobbyist, model 
        builders or general paleontology enthusiasts.
