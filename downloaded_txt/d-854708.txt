real people / flawless skin...


it's not magic, it's science!



 



“i've never found a skin lightening cream that actually worked before. despite having dark skin, my acne scars were really noticeable and embarrassing. i use to cake on concealer to hide it, but you could still see it through my makeup! it was awful!
but now my skin is light and fair, and looks perfectly even and beautiful.  i get compliments left and right about how great i look and how much smoother my skin is. thanks revitabright!”
 






what causes skin discoloration?
splotchy skin color is typically caused by sun exposure, acne, or skin illnesses that cause depigmentation. examples of skin discoloration include:

liver spots, sun spots, birthmarks

freckles, scars, blotchy skin

acne scarring, rosacea, melasma, chloasma


dark underarms, elbows, knees, and genitals

tan lines, sun damage

hyperpigmentation, vitiligo, uneven skin tones

          with their 30-day money-back guarantee!
if you don't experience the luxury of lighter, even-toned skin then simply return revitabright for a full refund.






skin brightening cream: revitol


editor's choice

brighter, lighter & healthier appearing skin
dermology skin brightener cream is the next best skin lightening cream available on the market today. like revitabright, dermology is non-toxic and contains only natural ingredients, including arbutin, lumiskin, shea butter, allantoin, and evening primrose oil. dermology also contains vitamins a, c and e to protect your skin from further  damage from sun and weather exposure. 
melanosomes and tyrosinase are the enzymes responsible for skin pigmentation and discoloration. revitol targets tyrosinase production to balance overall skin tone.
revitol not only lightens skin tone, but also protects from the damaging effects of the sun which further darken freckles and liver-spots over time.
clinical studies have shown that revitol's all-natural formula can lighten your skin just as a effectively as one with hydroquinone, but it is much safer for your skin.

skin lightening for hyperpigmentation: dermology


best new product

safe, gentle skin lightening
unlike revitabright and revitol, this product is really more of an exfoliant and moisturizer than a skin lightening cream. rather, dermology causes your skin to peel at first, exfoliating the skin before gradually lightening the overall skin tone.
dermology has a natural formula containing alpha arbutin, lumiskin and shea butter. unlike traditional skin brighteners, dermology does not contain hydroquinone - that means that you don't need to worry about negative side effects or skin damage from long-term use.
the one major downside to dermology is that it takes a while to take affect - as long as three months to begin lightening your skin tone. however, we recommend dermology for anyone suffering only minor splotchinesss or light freckling - it is a safe and natural alternative to hydroquinone-based skin lightening products. dermology is also very gentle and easy to use.
