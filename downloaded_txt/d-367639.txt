welcome to the washington state gambling commission


since 1973, the washington state gambling commission (wsgc) has helped protect the public by ensuring that gambling is legal and honest. in its time, the law enforcement accredited agency has expanded its oversight from punch boards and pull-tabs, to house-banked card rooms, tribal compacts for casinos, and nonprofit gambling activities. the wsgc has over 100 full-time staff throughout the state.
