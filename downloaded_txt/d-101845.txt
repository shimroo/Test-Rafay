who we are
etesters.com provides a searchable database of test and measurement equipment organized by topic and consisting solely of definitive manufacturer information.
our mission is to help test and measurement professionals make informed purchasing decisions and to guide them to the best available products for their application.


save time
to assist your product research, we have cataloged all manufacturers, product home pages, datasheets, applications, and manuals. while we do not sell any of these products, we do have links to contact/sales, distributors/reps, and buy online pages.


manage your catalog
are you a manufacturer? if so, your products are most likely already in our database. by sponsoring your product catalog, your products will appear in a sponsored tile at the top of search results, attracting more prospects to your product line.
