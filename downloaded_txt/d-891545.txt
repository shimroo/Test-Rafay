a message from our president
“with our core values being collaboration, responsibility, and diversity, it is our desire to spread hope and wholeness to all those who live in our territory.”





who we are
“the mid-america union exists to strengthen its local conferences and institutions.”

we provide services and resources for over 65,000 church members in more than 500 churches or companies throughout our territory, as well as nearly 75 elementary and secondary schools, one college, nine summer camps and a number of other youth and young adult programs.
