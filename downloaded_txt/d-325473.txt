        tzolken-sacred-cycle 1. solar-side 260-year tzolken sacred cycle 1 venus round flowsolar-side 260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles 1-4 resolves multiple venus round flows to a granular level. mayan & egyptian and jewish are the two venus round flow versions depicted by pie charts. mayan & egyptian solar-side 104-year venus rounds (s 104-y vr) equal two 52-year calendar rounds, where every 52-year calendar round  is an accepted mayan calendar term.  seth  400-year baktun cycle 3  in the mayan & egyptian version of the antediluvian calendar generates seth s 104-year vr 3  entirely by counting ordinary 365 day-solar-years. jewish solar-side 105-year venus rounds  in comparison, implement 50-year and 49-year jubilee cycle time streams. jubilee cycles  measure 364 day-ethiopic-years while reserving the final holy one day for  day & year numerical matching. mayan & egyptian version of solar-side 260-year tzolken sacred cycle 1 venus round flow  is easiest to learn, differing only slightly from the  jewish version. mayan & egyptian  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1  divides into  five 52-year calendar rounds (52-y cr) in  figure 37. two red active 52-year calendar round  sectors make each  m & e solar-side 104-year venus round. solar-side  venus round flow  diagrams are interim portraits designed to emphasize  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles 1-4. figure numbers  in this supplemental  article  refer directly to those appearing in holy_of_holies.
all  260 day-tzolken-sacred-years  and  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles  follow  day & year numerical matching concepts. lunar/solar  halving  and  quartering calendar tools  involving  360 day-tun-years and  360 year-tun-cycles  have similar provision. mayan & egyptian 52-year calendar rounds  fundamentally count  18,980-days. conversion to  260 day-tzolken-sacred-years  is accomplished through division and  73-tzolken-sacred-years  result. traditional  lunar/solar calendars employed  209-days or 210-days of lunar/solar separation time. early  jewish 19 year-l/s-cycles  with  209-days of l/s separation  closely approximate their  mayan & egyptian  counterpart that has  210-days of l/s separation  per  20 year-l/s-cycle. mayan & egyptian version  squares time by multiplying a  20 year-l/s-cycle  by itself to accomplish the  400-year baktun cycle.timeemits
 elaborates how multiple venus rounds calculate solar-side primary and 
secondary ages for seth and his grandson, cainan. this webpage in part, 
examines the solar-side linneage for the antediluvian patriarch family 
following adam. planet venus first quantifies 8-solar-year increments by
 mapping a celestial pentagram due to synodic, observable behavior. planet venus  completes a circuit in  8-solar-years, mapping out a  five pointed star  against a starry background. ancient people counted this complete  venus motion 13 times  in regard to a  104-year venus round. mayan & egyptian version  sequentially numbers  400-year baktun cycles 1-13  beginning with  adam  through  enoch. every numbered  mayan & egyptian 400-year baktun cycle  produces  208-years of lunar/solar separation time. half of 208-years  becomes the  m & e  solar-side 104-year venus round (s 104-y vr) and its  opposite half,  lunar/solar  104-year venus round  (s 104-y vr). judaism  once mixed  mayan & egyptian 400-year baktun cycle  traits with an advanced system using  210-years of lunar/solar separation time. the  jewish  solar-side  half  results in a likewise numbered  jewish 105-year solar-side time split (s 105-y vr).referring back to heliacal risings of venus figure 18, the entire synodic period of venus is 584-days. observable venus appears to average about 263-days as an evening and morning star. venus disappears on the near side of the sun for 8-days, and on the far side of the sun during a further 50-day period of invisibility.numerical matching related to venus' unique 584-day synodic cycic is obvious on many levels.  egyptian goddess, isis hides near the sun for 8-days to match a greek 8-year octaeteris of venusian motion. fifty days on the far side of the sun numerically match the famous 50-year jubilee cycle. ancient priest-astronomers saw time literally being pulled apart when venus materialized in opposite cardinal directions for similar durations. two nearly symmetrical venusian sightings were a hidden, yet profound spatial concept that gave rise to the entire antediluvian calendar. every venusian synodic cycle takes 8 solar-years or 2,920-days. six synodic cycles total 48 solar-years of an ordinary 52-year calendar round. the m & e 7th synodic cycle repeats the halving process by assigning 4 solar-years more to add with 48 solar-years of a calendar round. a standard m & e 52 solar-year calendar round pattern completes. following the inherent duality of venusian synodic cycles, the second 4 solar-years remaining begin the next 52 solar-year calendar round. together, 13 synodic cycles or 104 solar-years combine in the m & e 104-year venus round. ancient jewry promoted nearly identical venus observations in developing the 50-year jubilee cycle. thirteen venusian synodic cycles were the basis for establishing a jewish 105-year venus round. during the 7th synodic cycle, there was variation in how those 8 solar-years were divided and assigned. two opposing 4 solar-year periods were further equally subdivided to make 2 solar-year steps. after six synodic cycles or 48 solar-years, 2 solar-years were added to yield the presumed standard 50 solar-year jubilee cycle from leviticus. they carried over the next 2 solar-year step until ending the whole venus round. a second 50-year jubilee cycle followed the inherent duality of venusian synodic cycles to repeat this template. complete jewish 105-year venus rounds tallied two 50-year jubilee cycles, 4 solar-years of carry, and one final 105th solar-year left for numerical matching purposes. other innovations include the presence of the 364 day-ethiopic-year, a propensity to continue sabbaths according to 7 year-weeks, and the abandonment of egyptian theocracy after the exodus.archeo-astronomy often mixes prehistorical hebrew lore with early mythology. sun, moon and wandering planet venus were principal worship objects.  god dynamically "coming between" day and night transferred to venus rendering light and darkness throughout its entire  8 solar-year cycle. averages of 263-days ascribed for heliacal risings depended upon venus's greater rosette pattern. journey of the goddess provides impetus behind adopting 260 day-tzolken-sacred-years and 260 year-tzolken-sacred-cycles during early civilization. god is still "coming between" repeated light and darkness over 8-day and 50-day periods. venus rising in the east and setting in the west invoked a well known lighted bowtie effect prior to the fourth millenium bce. sumerian inanna/ishtar, and later mayan quetzalcoatl, both conveyed myths associating death, underworld and lastly resurrection embracing venus. naming father god, inanna, ishtar or isis reflects venus at the vanguard of early calendar systems. venus observation  was, and still is, a continuous process. prehistorical astronomy  somehow, at some time, permitted someone to synchronize  400-year baktun cycles  with their  appropriate  m & e  or  jewish version venus round. eons of  venus watching  yields two kinds of  venus rounds  demonstrated here for  seth's  active red primary age:  m & e seth  solar 104-y vr 3 (seth s 104-y vr 3) and  jewish seth  solar 105-y vr 3 (seth  s 105-y vr 3). venus round flow diagrams present a slightly different perspective in evaluating  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles 1-2. the  mayan & egyptian  solar-side  approach requires looking at the  venus round flow  directly. figure 36  segments  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1  venus round flow  into  five equal mayan & egyptian 52-year calendar rounds (52-y cr). mayan & egyptian seth  primary solar 104-year venus round 3 age (seth s 104-y vr 3) maintains  active red  color convention, dividing into  seth  1/2 s 104-y vr 3  and  seth  2/2 s 104-y vr 3  while showing  paired 52-y cr episodes. seth  400-year baktun cycle 3 in the  mayan & egyptian version  of the  antediluvian calendar generates seth  s 104-year vr 3  entirely by counting ordinary  365 day-solar-years. seth  400-year baktun cycle 3  begins counting at the close of  adam secondary 800-year generation cycle 1 age  or  when  adam  400-year baktun cycle 2 ends at  800 l/s-years in the  secondary age category. seth  400-year baktun cycle 3  adds the next  400 l/s-year step  to the   secondary age category  while simultaneously  generating seth  s 104-y vr 3. seth  400-year baktun cycle 3, along with  seth  s 104-y vr 3, count until reaching  seth midpoint age 1200 l/s-years. seth  s 104-y vr 4  is shown  inactive blue  prior to  seth midpoint age. solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1 is a product resulting from a series of  observable venus cycles.venus round flow diagrams  present  five incremental parts  to form a comparative perspective in evaluating  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles 1-4. mayan & egyptian  and  jewish  methods share  1/2  and  2/2  symbology in expressing full  venus rounds. m & e figures 36 -38 contain  five 52-year calendar rounds. m & e 104-year venus rounds  evenly divide by  two 52-year calendar rounds. jewish figures 41 - 43 substitute  five 50-year jubilee cycles  in place of  five m & e 52-year calendar rounds. jewish 364 day-ethiopic-years, along with  day & year numerical matching, are used to figure  50-year jubilee cycles, and subsequent progression to  49-year jubilee cycle diagrams. jewish 105-year venus rounds  include  2 x 50-ethiopic-years, plus the isolated  5-ethiopic-year tagline  recorded for  seth. jewish 105-year venus rounds, on the other hand, require the  approximation tilde ~ symbol. m & e  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles 1-3  provide comparisons and should not be considered a substitute for anything biblical. jewish  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycles 1-3  are products resulting from a series of  observable venus cycles. figures 36 - 37  leave  cainan  gray, holding a place value  52-y cr. gray  cainan 1/2 s 104-y vr 7 reserves the  final 52-y cr  half section of  solar-side 260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1  until m & e cainan's primary solar-side 73 tzolken-sacred-year age (1/2 cainan s 104-y vr 7).  solar-side  260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1 finishes by converting 1/2 cainan s 104-y vr 7 into its equivalent 52-year calendar round. the solar-side  path starts with  seth  and moves forward to  cainan. skipping  lunar/solar  enos  400-year baktun cycle 5, plus  enos  400-year baktun cycle 6, prepares for starting   solar-side  cainan  400-year baktun cycle 7 in  figure 38 at his 2400 l/s-year secondary age. consistent  52-year calendar rounds and/or  73-tzolken-sacred-year calendar rounds  require a specific  venus round flow  
to maintain the proper  solar-side  sequence.the above excerpt is taken from the holy_of_holies section entitled: solar-side 260-year tzolken sacred cycle 1 venus round flow.

  work continues behind the scenes. i am confident the lunar/solar green  flow accurately portrays adam, enos and mahalaleel according to their primary ages. a 360 day and year sequence finishes the first  lunar/solar 260 year sacred cycle. solar-side red operations flow down the path established by the primary ages of seth,  cainan and jared. seth articles needed most edits, especially those preparing transition to  cainan. cainan concludes the first  solar-side 260 year sacred cycle. all five characters meet biblical criterion for evaluating their  primary ages based on a  50 year jubilee cycle having  364 days per year. jared then begins the second  solar-side  260 year sacred cycle. jared's verbatim primary age introduces a stark change in jubilee cycle observtion. shifting from 50 year jubilee cycles to recording 49 year jubilee cycles is more in line with traditional sabbath keeping. leviticus 25:8 directs people to maintain seven year weeks. natural progression counts 7 cycles of 7 year weeks. i believe the  solar-side  of the jewish calendar always fulfilled intercalary functions. we currently have the 10 days of awe, that begin with rosh hashanah sunset and close with yom kippur. ten days of awe are spiritually a period of 
repentance and renewal. yom kippur is the solemn day of atonement.holy_of_holies, like ages_of_adam, divides the 360 day mark to obain about 354 days on the  lunar/solar  side.  the solar-side  carries the surplus until 364 days and the ethiopic (enochian) year completes. the last day of an ordinary 365 day solar year becomes the numerical match day, and is used to number years. ten days  of  lunar-to-solar separation time  clearly evidence remnants of an ancient system present in the modern 
jewish calendar. we cannot construe or equate these 10 days to be the named  10 days of awe, for they have entirely different meanings. my opinion numbers the last numerical match day until a full seven year week is achieved. counting continues until  7 increments of 7 year weeks complete the whole 49 year jubilee cycle. seven year weeks never carry named years. day of atonement  is named and isolated after 10 days of awe with special reverence. again, the  numerical match last day  used here is limited to similar lunar/solar math  purposes.download march 2022 instant delivery  with purchase.  payloadz download link  comes with  $ 34.95  purchase. i may follow-up with a second  download link  and/or quality check, thank you email.   buy now ages of adam  sku aoa 12-6 $9.95 ebook version 5 for mobile apps and ministry affiliates

        patriarchs adam through enoch alternate primary ages
      between the lunar/solar 260-year
        tzolken-sacred-cycle and the solar-side




















        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle. the whole lineage of genesis




















        5 progresses in a ladder-like order. lunar/solar 260-year
            tzolken-sacred-cycle 1 begins with adam.
      his son, seth starts solar-side 260-year
              tzolken-sacred-cycle 1. flow returns
      to lunar/solar
        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1 when seth fathers enos.
      enos begets cainan and the calendar alternates back to solar-side
        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1. cainan fathers
        mahalaleel to begin solar-side
        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 2. mahalaleel
      alternates the flow to complete lunar/solar
            260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1. mahalaleel
        sires jared to accomplish intersections on both sides. jared
      finishes lunar/solar
            260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 2 and
      simultaneously fulfills solar-side
              260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 3. seventh




































        patriarch enoch sums the lunar/solar
      group by opening lunar/solar


































                      260-year
        tzolken-sacred-cycle 3 and his heavenly translation. 

      the mesopotamian term, 360 day-midpoint-year was
      originally adopted in ages_of_adam. earliest lunar/solar































































        calendars chose a central 360 day midpoint position
      between a lunar-side lasting 12-lunations and the solar-side
        having 365-days. ancient biblical time is always cyclic. the
      first course of time is laid to become the foundation layer for
      the next course of time. a series of numbered repetitions are the
      key. longer times are then successively measured by multiples
      courses. all lunar/solar themes carry a natural tendency
      to measure necessary lunar/solar separation time. the jewish




















        calendar distributes about 209-days of lunar/solar




















        separation time by inserting 7-months over a 19-year




















        lunar/solar cycle. early mayan and egyptian versions
      approximated 210-days of lunar/solar separation time over
      20-year lunar/solar cycles. time rendering concepts
      include squaring specific cycles to obtain a numbered
      multiple. mayan and egyptian l/s calendars
      multiplied a 20-year lunar/solar cycle by
      itself. the 400-year baktun cycle result creates a stepped
      l/s calendar able to count vast epochs.
 
genesis 5 scripture is re-written as a mathematical
      expression for antediluvian patriarchs: adam, seth, enos,
        cainan, mahalaleel, jared and enoch. all primary age
        category entries extend until each character "begat" his
        next named son. primary age is the first of two
      numbered ages describing his lifetime. secondary age is
      the second numbered age lasting until the character ends. adam
        primary 130-tun-year age is the
      concise example applied to genesis 5:3.

mayan & egyptian and jewish are the two general
      classifications for holy_of_holies calendar material. mayan


































        & egyptian is the main source for terminology, codified
      as necessary and drawn from classical mayan calendar
      study. jewish refers to holy bible scripture taken
      from the old testament. lunar/solar calendars
      involve an exceptional kind of arithmetic. phrases and terms are
      inherently limited to simple operations: addition, subtraction,
      multiplication and division. the key to understanding the math
      used in this body of work is to grasp the basics. anyone must
      start reading a good book from the beginning. mayan & egyptian and jewish
          lunar/solar calendars have many commonalities. most
        formulas define the character name in bold black, followed by
        numerical quantity and the specific term. adam




















            primary 130-tun-year age indicates the adam personage. primary
          is adam's first quoted age he begat his listed
          son, seth. the quantity is 130.
          tun is a mayan
            calendar term meaning a 360-day length of year.
          age captures the period ... an hundred and thirty years. green text and graphics below signify adam is a lunar/solar name.

mayan 52-year calendar rounds
      culminate a dual system for tracking multiple years. the mayan
        tzolken embodies sacred, ritualistic type of year. each
        tzolken has 260-days. the hyphenated phrase 260
        day-tzolken-sacred-year summarily operates in conjunction
      with 360 day-tun-years to accomplish every 52-year
        calendar round. the 52-year calendar round counts
      18,980-days. ordinary 365 day-solar-years are used to
      compute 52-year calendar rounds. there are 73-tzolken-sacred-years
      per each 52-year calendar round.

antediluvian patriarchs adam through enoch adhere
      their respective primary ages to either the lunar/solar 260-year
        tzolken-sacred-cycle or the solar-side
        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle. adam, enos and mahalaleel
      together form the first lunar/solar
        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 1. enoch begins the first





















        quarter of lunar/solar
        260-year tzolken-sacred-cycle 2. green




































          text and graphics are used for lunar/solar adam, enos and mahalaleel
        primary age category members.
