welcome to san gabriel academy.














a higher aim for christian education.



at sga, we are educating for eternity. it’s important to be skilled in reading, competent in math, and proficient in science. but the most important thing is that our children have a personal understanding of who christ is.

standards-based learning
at san gabriel academy (sga), we believe that the highest kind of education aligns with our christ-centered philosophy and should seek to unfold god's plan for our students’ lives. this type of education program requires high levels of intentionality and design. sga uses standards-based learning (sbl) as the basis for designing our curricular program. sbl is the foundation for developing our framework.

academicswe aim to teach our students to love the lord and to strive for excellence through our strong academic program. we believe that even the way we give our students grades and feedback can be a tool to reflect the character and grace of god.

athletics
the goal of our athletic department is to develop christian character as well as athletic skills. our commitment to christ is evident in the teamwork, work ethic, integrity, discipline, sportsmanship, humility, dependability, enthusiasm, and christ-likeness of our athletes.
