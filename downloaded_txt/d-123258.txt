this is a treasure of an rv park ! we stayed 6 nights in our silent auction won rv. it was the most relaxing, easy vacation we have experienced. golfed 4 days with wonderful jeff or susan driving us to where we needed to go, including carmel valley ranch (10 minutes away).  and jeff helped with silly stuff we didn't know about rv's. next time we'll rent one of the onsite rv's, and we will definitely be back!

frequently asked questions

                please view our faq to answer any common questions you may have. for any other questions, please call our office at +1 (831) 624-9329.
            


how big is your park?
we are a small-boutique park with only 35 sites total. it is a garden-like setting, with lots of foliage, flowers, and trees throughout the park.

do you have sites on the river?
we do not have riverfront sites or access to the river. it is considered a protected area. the river does however provide a soothing background sound and is home to many frogs. garland regional park is 5.2 miles to our east and offers river access points for your pets. carmel beach is a dog-friendly beach as well.

are your sites pull-through sites or back-in sites?
most of our sites are back-in sites. we do have a handful of pull-forward sites for motorhomes only, but they are not pull-throughs as you have to reverse when leaving.

do you have full hookups?
yes we do. we offer sites with either 30 or 50 amp.

are there hiking trails from the park?
our park is surrounded by private property and there are no hiking trails from the park. closest hiking trails are garland ranch regional park (5.2 miles east of our location; dog friendly), and point lobos (8.6 miles southwest of our location; not dog friendly)

are there fire pits at the sites?
no, we do not offer fire pits within our sites. you may bring your own propane fire pit if you like. propane fire pits are also available for rent. wood burning fires are not allowed per monterey county and carry a fine of $150, $100 if wood fire debris is found in your site upon departure. you may burn charcoal or duraflame logs in your site’s grill. both are available at the park office.

can i pick my site when making reservations?
final site assignments are made the day of your arrival. we will take requests and try our best to honor those requests. 


do you have a swimming pool?
we do not.

do you have uber/lyft in the area?
there are taxis, uber, lyft, and car rental agencies in our area that you could look into as transportation. many guests drive their rv to nearby shopping centers and have car services meet, and return them, there. this seems to reduce wait times.

do you have a laundry room?
we do not. the closest laundromat is 3 miles down the road at the midvalley shopping center

do you have a dumping station?
we do not have a dumping station. all of our sites have full hookups including a private sewer connection.

confusion on arrival & departure dates
our confirmation is written as your arrival date to your departure date.

how long does it take for a refund to process?
refunds generally take 3-5 five business days for processing.

are tents allowed?
sorry, we do not allow tent camping.
