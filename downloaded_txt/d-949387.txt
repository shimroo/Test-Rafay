lead the charge in learning




change-makers, unite!the schlechty center is a private, non-profit organization committed to partnering with education leaders who are interested in nurturing a culture of engagement in their organizations, with the ultimate goal of increasing profound learning for students. we also bring change-makers together in collaborative networks to provide support as they undertake the hard work of transforming their classrooms, schools, and school districts. while many organizations are focused on measuring engagement, we are focused on the "how" of designing work—work that not only engages students in learning but also invigorates staff and gets teachers excited about teaching. that's the sweet spot. and that's at the heart of everything we do. since its founding in 1987, the schlechty center has provided strategic consultation, targeted advice, and technical assistance to district and school leaders at all levels. we support leaders in creating engagement-focused schools and school districts that result in better outcomes for students, their families, and the communities in which they live. let’s get started. it's time to lead the charge.

a legacy of learning




it began with one man and became a movement.our founder, dr. phillip c. schlechty, was a leader, a leader who faced the challenges of public education head on. for decades, he fought in the trenches with educators working to save public education. more than thirty years ago, phil launched the schlechty center to transform learning experiences. the schlechty center allowed him to scale and amplify the impact of his efforts by defining a philosophy and frameworks that change-makers everywhere could adopt and use to impact their own communities. schlechty center senior associates continue to shape those frameworks by learning with and from clients across the country. click here to see phil’s writings. click here to see our current schlechty center team.
