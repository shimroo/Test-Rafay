i highly recommend the infant massage training course. the online training was very flexible and accessible. as a mum juggling homeschooling (for my autistic son) and various casual/part time work, i really appreciated the ability to complete the course in a way that suited me and my family’s needs. the materials are clear and i loved seeing real life examples on the training videos to fully understand the material. also, the assessment process provided excellent learning opportunities to become ready for work in this field.

face-to-face course details

face-to-face training dates and locations can be found on our course dates and locations page: locations | baby massage
the face-to-face training is completed over 3 days and courses are always held on a friday, saturday & sunday.



career and qualification pathways

infant massage information service 3-day face-to-face courses have a mixture of both certified infant massage instructor (cimi) and paediatric massage consultant (pmc) students.
all students cover the same content/units of study.
the differences are:
- our cimi students are usually going into the industry as something new i.e. with no prior related background. there are no pre-requisite requirements they need to meet.
- cimi students complete the 3-day course successfully and are then able to work with parents, teaching infant massage. all assessment work is completed within the 3 days of the course.
- our pmc students have prior, related training and/or experience in health, allied health, natural therapies or early childhood education and care.
- after the 3 days in class, there is one additional assignment completed. the additional pmc task takes approximately 2 days to complete and does not need to be done in the 2 days directly following the course. pmc students can complete their additional assessment when convenient and follow the instructions provided to upload their submission for marking when they're ready. 
- our pmc students receive both qualifications – the cimi qualification and the pmc qualification. the cimi level qualification is provided immediately after the 3-day face-to-face course and the pmc qualification is issued after the additional pmc assessment has been completed. 
- pmcs can work with parents, teaching infant massage in the same way that cimis can. what pmcs are also able to do is provide theory presentations to professional groups on infant massage. the presentations are fairly straightforward and usually follow the same format e.g. – self-introduction, benefits of infant massage, research reviews, dispelling common myths relating to infant massage and information on services available to parents in this field. 
various industry bodies request these types of presentations and pmcs are paid a presentation fee for this work directly by the organisation or body who has requested them. pmc presentations offer a unique opportunity to network with other professionals and potentially receive additional referrals for your infant massage work with parents.  
 
what if i'm completing the course via correspondence study?
each correspondence intake period has a mix of both certified infant massage instructor (cimi) and paediatric massage consultant (pmc) students.
all students cover the same content/units of study.

the differences are:
- our cimi students are usually going into the industry as something new i.e. with no prior related background. there are no pre-requisite requirements they need to meet.
- cimi students successfully complete 3 competency tasks at their own pace and are then able to work with parents, teaching infant massage. 
- our pmc students have prior, related training and/or experience in health, allied health, natural therapies or early childhood education and care.
- there is one additional assignment completed for the pmc qualification.
- our pmc students receive both qualifications – the cimi qualification and the pmc qualification.
- pmcs can work with parents, teaching infant massage in the same way that cimis can. what pmcs are also able to do is provide theory presentations to professional groups on infant massage. the presentations are fairly straightforward and usually follow the same format e.g. – self-introduction, benefits of infant massage, research reviews, dispelling common myths relating to infant massage and information on services available to parents in this field. 
various industry bodies request these types of presentations and pmcs are paid a presentation fee for this work directly by the organisation or body who has requested them. pmc presentations offer a unique opportunity to network with other professionals and potentially receive additional referrals for your infant massage work with parents. 



online study

the correspondence program is thorough, easy to work through and offers a convenient way to study. 100% of the course requirements are completed from home, including all practical work meaning no travel or onsite attendance is needed.
once your enrollment is complete and the course fees are paid, you will receive a welcome email providing you with full access to the course content. your welcome email includes your pdf training manual with all of the course theory work and assessment instructions as well as links to the practical video files you need to watch. a training pack containing your demonstration doll and any other resources in your enrolment pack is sent via post.
there's no need to wait for your training pack to arrive via post before you begin studying. as soon as you receive your welcome email you can get started with the course theory work, then move on to the practical techniques once your demonstration doll arrives. 
you're welcome to study at your own pace to complete the course. most students complete everything within the space of a few weeks. if students have a lot of other commitments and limited time, they might finish the course over a few months instead. whatever study period you need is ok, there are no enforced deadlines you need to meet. 
there are 3 or 4 assessment tasks to complete depending on the qualification level you enrol in. the tasks are easy to complete and personalised assistance is available throughout the course if you need help with questions or clarifications. 
your theory assessment is an open book, multiple-choice exam which ensures you've worked through the training manual. you're provided with an answer sheet to complete which can be emailed as an attachment or uploaded for marking. practical tasks are recorded using any device (most students use their phone). the recordings are uploaded for the trainers to view and report on. practical reports are extremely detailed to ensure you're confident in practical techniques prior to certification.
