   i hope you like your god-talk
spicy! 

my name is errol
mueller, i am an
independent spiritual researcher and chronicler.  in my book and website,
i take you on a journey of rediscovery as i open an ancient door that has been
chained and bolted closed by the institutional religionists for over two
millennia.  it is the door to the ancient knowledge of personal and family home
worship.  
(to
learn more click arrows)  
 
i would like to announce (just in case you haven't
heard) that you and every other human being on the planet - rich or poor, small
or great, male or female, of every race - have a "personal,  sacred-covenant  relationship" with our
creator - even those who do not believe.  the key phrase is
"personal," no one stands between you and your maker.  

did you know, that nowhere in the  bible does
it state: "...to get into heaven you get a better deal through a group
rate."   

god is not just for priests! 
the heads of the
house are the providers, teachers, and priests of the household.  faith begins
at home (1tim.5:4), and the family is the keystone of the faith.   
home worship is home improvement  for the soul and
spirit! the spiritual power-tools needed for home
improvement have been considered by the
gatekeepers of orthodoxy as "classified" and on a need-to-know
basis.  they are ancient sacred rites and are "personal" spiritual power-tools available
to the believers directly from god, they are e-v-e-r-lasting, and they bring you
peace.   
before
there was a church, synagogue, or temple,  there were the ancient ways of home worship, or
sometimes called today, family devotions.  from
noah to abraham, to the patriarchs, to moses, and on to the very first christians, there are many biblical examples of
the ancient art of home worship. there are times
when you are away on a trip, or for some reason you are isolated, homebound, or a
shut-in, or the local worship organizations have become corrupted, one has the
right to shut the doors to the outside world, and in private, pay spiritual
respect to our creator, (2kin.4:33; mat.6:6).  
worshiping
at home is easy to do.  a simple
prayer of thanks before a meal, or a bedtime prayer is a type of home worship.
this is not about house churches, where family groups gather in
someones home for non-institutionalized fellowship. this is about an individual believers rite to communicate to the
higher powers 'directly' and to make use of the
advantages of the higher spiritual order governed by our creator.    

in the news:  a
nationwide survey indicates that the number of unchurched adults  in america
continues to grow by nearly a million people annually.  interestingly, many
of these unchurched people are spiritually active. 
do you want more of god in your life but cannot get what you need from a
local church?  do you love god but find yourself church hopping?  or are you an
out
of church christian?  then consider worshipping at home.  


the ancient ways carry
    purpose 




and should not be
    forlorned.



 
 discover the
forgotten biblical holy days along with their historical,
current day, and prophetic meanings, which a-l-l believers can enjoy.  they
are ancient spiritual keys to a timeless treasure trove of divine knowledge.  



in the news: many
christians
are
        part of a fast
        growing global movement
who say it is the ancient
        ways, the historic, and the biblical ways that matter
        most (jer.6:16).
        
 


truth is stranger then fiction. 
we
are going to examine the greatest science fact or fiction story ever told - it
is for you to decide. the hope is that you will feel energized by the
illumination of some spiritual biblical truths that are rarely taught.  
as we enter the new millennium, all humanity
should acknowledge one clear lesson from history: when discussing or debating
the higher spiritual world of our creator, if one, or several, are driven to
violence to make their point, then they have already lost the argument. 
and that should go for governments too! 


knowledge is power, 




and divine knowledge is
the most powerful!!!




sharing it is empowerment!
