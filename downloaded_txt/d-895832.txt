see "tech" for upgrade-to-deluxe model info

i am a novice heli flyer.  i had about ten years experience with building and flying model airplanes in the past, with plenty of dreaming of my first heli..(ever since i saw the first one in action when i was 7 yrs. old)  now, at 26, i finally got one for myself.
i have put information on these pages which deal only with the kyosho nexus 30 s-type-s.  it's highly recommend to visit your local ama sanctioned club or hobby shop before you ever fly your heli for the first time.  trust me, if you do not have everything exactly perfect and trimmed out correctly, your heli will become an expensive pile of garbage quicker than you can blink!  it can also kill you if you don't know what you're doing.  you can never get it flying 'as perfect as it can possibly fly' or even at all without the help of an expert.
a big big thanks to
