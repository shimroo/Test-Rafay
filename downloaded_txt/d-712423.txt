welcome to compassionate pug rescue! compassionate pug rescue (cpr) is an all volunteer organization dedicated to saving the life of one pug at a time. we open our homes and our hearts to provide food, shelter, medical care, a warm bed and loving hands to help the hundreds of broken, needy and hurting little ones that come to us. it is our goal to match each and everyone with the best possible forever home‚Ä¶ so that they will never again be homeless.


meet the pugs in permanent foster & hospice care cpr currently has about a dozen pugs and non-pugs in permanent foster or hospice care.
with the generosity of our supporters, we are able to help each of these precious souls with their special dietary, medical and physical needs!

		another big thank you is in order!  this time a big thank you goes to terri & joe for donating a dog bed, food, grooming supplies, medications and lots of fun toys in memory of all of their pups, most recently loki and gunner.  sadly, both were lost within months of each other.  hope those boys are running, playing and eating all the best snackies while they wait at the bridge! üêæüåà
