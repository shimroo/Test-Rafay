upcoming exhibitions & events
raptor program

join our weekly public raptor presentations every saturday and sunday at 11 am. our raptor educators take you outdoors to see the bald eagles in our care, liberty and ferguson. both of these majestic raptors have injuries that prohibit them from living in the wild.

not able to make it? you can still view the bald eagles on our live raptor cam in the explorer room during regular museum hours.
saturday spinners
members of the northwest weavers guild and northwest regional spinners association will be here most saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm demonstrating traditional weaving and spinning in the river gallery. join them to give it a try and discuss the past and current role of sheep ranching, wool production, and fiber arts in the region. 
riverfront trail
our scenic and historic riverfront trail is always open from dawn to dusk, and we encourage you to enjoy the trails.

we require pets to be on leashes for their safety and yours. remember: not all dogs are friendly when confronted with an unleashed animal. it triggers “stranger danger” instincts. please continue to clean up after your pets.

open daily from 9 am to 5 pm
