          as america grapples with an escalating plastic crisis, the city of houston, exxonmobil and other partners announced a new program that promised to recycle nearly all of the city's plastic waste. however, after two years, the program has yet to fully materialize. critics argue that the evidence suggests it never will. and yet, the company envisions similar programs in other american cities. cbs reports and inside climate news investigate whether this proposed solution to our plastic recycling crisis is indeed too good to be true.

          nearly 95% of people currently in prison will be released back into society, and historically a significant percentage are likely to reoffend. in california, authorities are trying to change that by providing inmates access to education, work and other rehabilitative privileges — programs that have been shown to reduce recidivism and increase public safety. cbs reports examines a controversial approach some see as being “soft on crime,” which now may be preventing it.
