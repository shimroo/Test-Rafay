			this is a link to a few amazon.com reviews of 1st album, self-titled "wilderness road"

one review:
this record is like a cowboy comic book, telling the story of a guy who killed a man because he "had the right." 
			there's some old-time religion thrown in, as well as some medicine-show. 
			the album cover is listed in several collections as one of the top covers of all time. 
			the early seventies vibe might put you off, but it's a melodious joy, even now. 
			it's more fun than gunsmoke reruns.







			this is a link to a few amazon.com reviews of the 2nd album "sold for the prevention of disease only"

one review:
wilderness road was something of a legend in chicago in the late 60s and early 70s. 
			i saw them at clubs and on the northwestern campus a few times. 
			they were ahead of their time in mixing good musicianship with really biting parody, much of it political. 
			all these years later i can still remember much of this album-- 
			commercials by ricky and the balloons for "mouth jive" (spread it on and watch your body come alive!), and a routine called "the gospel hour," 
			featuring a really nifty song called "what key does the good lord sing in?" as i recall, warren leming was a former member of second city, 
			so the satire made sense, but i don't think the record company and the public knew what to make of the band. 
			this was their high point. it's very much worthy of a listen when located-- i'm going to dig out my copy and spin it soon, and not just for reasons of nostalgia...
