i do not believe that kids who are institutionalized get enough love at all. i believe they’re treated as objects.

i want to help break down the destructive generational structures that children in foster care inherit. but also celebrate memory and ancestry – including my own ancestors, who have been right there with me for 32 hard years.

even if the world is challenging and hard, we shouldn’t just be asking young people about their traumas. we should be finding out what helps them thrive and figuring out how we can make those things possible.

one of the many reasons i participated in are you listening? is to lift up all of the voices that were never heard, all of the youth that were mistreated at the hands of the system. all the young people i have worked with over the years. people listened to me and that’s why i am who i am today.

it is unfair and cruel to expect young people who have already suffered so much, been denied support and the unconditional love every child deserves to get no help in the biggest transition of their lives — adulthood. imagine being expected to pay the rent and be responsible with no information and no resources. not fair.

today, when i encounter transgender children, be they teens or younger kids, i remember my own childhood. i recall the longing to be heard and seen as myself. i remember the confusing and oftentimes lonely battles with self-doubt. my need for support and affirmation from others was profound. i badly wanted to belong, just like everyone else. i know that these children want the same.
