the limits of ai for your foreign and comparative legal research needs

there is no doubt that artificial intelligence (ai) has revolutionized many industries, the legal sector among them. furthermore, it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future in ways that we haven’t even begun to comprehend. however, i fear that its promise of solving and revolutionizing every single legal challenge or area is often overstated, especially when it comes to foreign, comparative, and international legal (fcil) research. ai promises of easiness, rapidity, and exclusively results-oriented approaches fundamentally clash with fcil work, which demands robust research steps, awareness of processes, and a sense of curiosity in a globalized world that  . . .

swipe right on empathy: the key to legal design success

what was the last good first date you had? there may have been an element of physical interest, but it is highly likely it was a “good” date because it lasted for hours, and the longer you spoke, the more interesting you found the other person, and vice versa. maybe the conversation didn’t start off strong, but at some point you hit on a topic that you both found interesting. you found common ground and that led to connection. it is also likely that the date was better because it involved a “ping-pong” style of conversation. you asked the right  . . .

access to justice in 2025: what does the year ahead hold?

as we contemplate 2025, the nsrlp is considering how to tackle the ongoing challenges in access to justice. while the barriers facing individuals attempting to access justice remain many, it is challenging to consider where the focus on improving access should be directed, given limited resources and capacity. moreover, the coming year is likelier than not to have a fair share of political, social, and economic upheaval, all of which may also serve to impact access to justice in both anticipated and unanticipated ways. thus, thinking about where the nsrlp goes next is a necessary exercise, and one requiring flexibility  . . .

getting resolution right:  5 things to consider when making settlement agreements

when issues arise in condos, there are benefits to working with those involved to address them. collaborating offers advantages unavailable through an adversarial path – such as relationship preservation and creative, sustainable outcomes which extend beyond a tribunal’s jurisdiction. the condominium authority of ontario offers an array of online resources to support collaboration, from communication guidance to help identifying issues, to understanding how the law applies to them and more.
the cao’s condominium authority tribunal further encourages collaboration within its three-staged online process. once a case is filed, parties experiencing a dispute are invited to address their issue together through  . . .  [more]
