featuredartist:avery anna 



attracting attention from esteemed media outlets like rolling stone, billboard, american songwriter and more, exciting newcomer avery anna is currently climbing the charts with sam barber on their viral duet, “indigo.” the young singer/songwriter is also continuing to celebrate the release of her 2024 debut album, breakup over breakfast, where she “further displays promise and prowess” (grammy.com). the album features 17 tracks all written or co-written by the “towering, soul-baring tunesmith" (billboard) and showcases her ability to harness raw emotion and infuse it into a nuanced lyricism well beyond her years. produced by david fanning, breakup over breakfast contains stories ranging from romance to rage, penned with a sacred honesty and sung with a soulful heart. the “brave debut album” (entertainment focus) follows her 2022 debut ep, mood swings, that earned her artist to watch nods from amazon music, apple music, pandora, spotify, youtube, musicrow and cmt. the seven-song introduction features her viral, platinum-certified hit, “narcissist,” that she performed on the 2023 cmt music awards, where she was nominated for breakthrough artist of the year, before making her morning tv debut on nbc’s today. with more than 500 million global streams to date, the arizona native has quickly become an in-demand touring artist, recently announced as support on luke bryan’s upcoming country song came on tour.
