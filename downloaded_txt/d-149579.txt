love inside a frame





poetry i wrote during a class.  i think the ta was scared of me afterwards.love inside a frame   they say that a picture is one-thousand words worthy, of all of my pictures i’ll think of you surely   your eyes are so devious as that shade of lipstick reveals, the stains on your chest matches what drips on your heels.   and what’s on your chest, a gaping wide orifice. i’m amused you’re alive, my little snuff fetish.   i don’t seek to love, i trifle not with lust. my object of affection, you bring me disgust.   i want your punctured chest. rippling with spikes. bring it to me and, i’ll see to it. you need it. no more.anotherode to a struggling bouquet   i traveled far to find you flowering, hidden.   do you know how you curve? like an infant, nestled in arms.   hues so vibrant, so strong to survive,   lavender lover. blue creeps into a green sea, a slice of sky held tenderly   amongst brown piles.   while yellow brashlyvies for attention, onlookers look on   but i see you.   five no, six. no, five. no.   100!   petals shed like days apprehended, awaiting.   i took you and made you mine.   when you wither, i’ll remember.

ichorous gold





my most ambitious and difficult poem.  i was balancing too many images and motifs.  you might notice i don't care too much about theme - i let it occur as the process gets written.  the sound of words and the interweaving of the images is much more important.  after all, theme is so mutable, what we can learn can be valuable only in specific contexts that i don't ever stand behind any one theme.  in fact, since i do images first, i guess the images dictate the theme, so i have it unconsciously written before i decide on what the theme is.  this poem will be unfinished for a while.beneath the incandescence iron wrought with alchemymarks lines to trace backcrimes upon our facefather, i have lost my soulquenched my thirst in life with theblood of those (ichorous gold) <- backing screamscan you see, they are much like you and me <- bad grammar in the name of poetrycelestial tapestry, you're falling down, burning down, uncreated, (i know the unknown)  "your arms flail so madly is this what they call life? your skin bright, eyes wideopen your skull"  "i see you now, in you young "if it ends now, what were you? illusion" "run away, to worlds unseen, you can only go where i've been i'll place you down amongst the husks you exist as one of them" equilibria in different ways tear flesh apart revealed we're the same hey apollo,i've stolen your sunthe wheels you ridethe skein now flowsin between these concrete skiesaphrodite,your daughters consume youtear away your flesh from the terra i gave you life

jaded phrases





i wrote it in about 5 to 10 minutes, in a single stroke of genius.  will need to be edited and the imagery will need to be made more cohesive.  also, veneer isn't as poetic as i would like.  need to change that.my sky tonightis lacquered veneerdust awashthrough celestial glaretongue tastes copper with a jade braceletpry from pallid armsswinging from saturn's ringssuccumbbecomereturn to earth, spacemanour fool's traipsed over a knoll hecan't see overall my lifei've waited for thisand worn the mark too brazenlysee the viridian spinso, rings of saturn,pull me in
