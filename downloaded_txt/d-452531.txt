welcome to the department of biochemistry and molecular biophysics.
precise understanding of the molecular interactions that underlie both normal physiology and disease states is the foundation for rational approaches to genetic therapies, drug design and personalized medicine. our goal in this endeavor is to obtain a molecular understanding of mechanism (i.e., how biological molecules carry out their functions). we seek to advance our understanding of biology using the disciplines of chemistry, physics and mathematics.
our department provides a rich environment for both faculty and student growth, and we welcome inquiries.
