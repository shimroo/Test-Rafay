january & march 2022: photo gallery updates


march 15, 2022new photo album, web site updatesrcw ryan 


long time, no update everyone! i’m still alive and still very much interested in watching new buildings grow downtown. i’ve got a bit more time on my hands lately and i have vowed to start back with some periodic gallery updates. there is so much construction occurring around the metro area and i want to ensure i document it. 
the biggest recent change to the site is the update to the gallery module. the former gallery module is no longer being updated and it was only a matter of time before it stopped working. in february 2022, i migrated 19,000+ photos over to the new piwigo gallery module. please use this link to see all new content going forward.
