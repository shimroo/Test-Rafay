welcome to the continental line
the continental line, inc., established in 1987 and incorporated in 1995 as a not-for-profit organization in the state of pennsylvania, is a educational organization of recreated units representing the continental army, the continental artillery, the continental marines, the state navies, the various colonial militias, and units in the service of the french king during the american revolution.
the line, which assembles units from georgia to new hampshire, was organized to promote a better understanding of the history of the united states during the time our nation won its independence from great britain. these units share in public battle scenarios, 18th century diversions, as well as various aspects and interpretations of a soldier’s life during the american revolution.
