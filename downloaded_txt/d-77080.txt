christ episcopal church is a loving and welcoming church family, centrally located in the historic monte vista district of san antonio, texas. our sanctuary is one of the most peaceful and beautiful churches in the country, but the real beauty of our church is our people. we are a large church, but with a small, familial feel and lots of ways to become involved.
