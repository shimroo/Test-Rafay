thank you!





























teaching family martial arts in soquel village since 1980. welcome to our dojo…



sensei rod sanford opened our school in 1980 and been teaching traditional okinawan karate in santa cruz county since 1967. his son, sensei sean sanford, is now the head instructor and general manager. our school primarily practices shorinji-ryu karate, but our style also includes aiki-jujutsu (joint locks and takedowns) as well as traditional weaponry. 



our school offers classes for ages 4 and up.  classes are split by age and rank. character development is placed at the forefront of our teachings. we have weekly mat chats on subjects such as showing respect, self-discipline, honesty, bullying and stranger awareness.  our class curriculum is very structured and developed to increase student’s fitness, coordination, strength, body awareness as well as teach them the fundamentals of practical self-defense.
