fault lines interview: what hope does impeachment give democrats? 







i spoke with garland nixon and lee stranahan on sputnik's program fault lines. we talked about impeachment, how the democrats gave trump everything he wanted (space force, trade bill, patriot act) but then use impeachment to give the appearance of being a real opposition party.

in defense of julian assange









"but apparently assange didn't understand the true nature of corruption in the united states. he didn't realize what it meant for him to say that the difference between hillary clinton and donald trump was a choice between 'cholera or gonorrhea.' those words created an enmity which exists to this day and prevents people whose politics would otherwise make them his defenders from speaking on his behalf."

those are just some of the words i wrote in the or books anthology, in defense of julian assange. my chapter is entitled, "the naïveté of julian assange." i'm very proud of my contribution to this book which is edited by tariq ali and margaret kunstler. a purchase supports assange's defense fund. other contributors include chris hedges, kevin gosztola, caitlin johnstone, nozomi hayase, noam chomsky, stefania maurizi, craig murray and john pilger.
