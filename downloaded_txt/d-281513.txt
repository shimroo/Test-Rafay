hello

      these pages are currently going through an overhaul, so some pages
      will seem quite old while others have the same format as this one.
    

      i'm a somewhat irregular dude, who enjoys computing enormously, a life
      filled with love just as much, as well as spirituality and energy.  i'm
      currently walking a path where i go away from personal insecurity and
      other not so positive characteristics, and go toward a life in truth
      and personal responsability for myself.
    

i take
      my wisdom and strength from the wolf.  some might regard it as a
      totem, but since i don't feel specifically connected to any
      native american tribe, the closest i dare call it is "a totem of
      sorts".
      



      if you want to share my struggles with life, please take a peek in
      my diary.
