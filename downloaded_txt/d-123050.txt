our services 



							dental health associates provides an extremely wide range of dental services for you and your family – our neighbors – in multiple convenient new jersey locations. we also provide emergency dental care 24/7. new patients are always welcome! call us today and we’ll fit you right in!						






 




							our doctors						


						from our general dentists to our specialists, our  accredited, passionate, and caring team leaders  are here for you. we are committed to providing 
dentistry that will help you achieve your optimal  oral and overall health.					









 




							dental implants						


						tooth loss can cause embarrassment, difficulty eating, 
speaking … and speaking up. dental implants may be 
the perfect solution to reclaim your smile. call for a 
consultation about natural-looking 
replacement teeth!					









 




							teeth whitening						


						sometimes no matter how meticulous your home care, 
you can’t get rid of tooth stains. we have solutions! 
our in-office and at-home teeth whitening products 
are extremely effective and popular. call today!					









 




							dental emergencies						


						when a dental emergency happens, the sooner you are 
treated, the better the outcome. that’s why we have
 extended hours and a dentist on-call 24/7. let us 
ease your pain and provide treatment quickly.					









 




							dental crown						


						at dental health associates, we can fully restore 
damaged and missing teeth to their maximum beauty
 and performance with dental crowns. with incredible 
efficiency and beautiful esthetics, dental crowns will 
help you chew, talk, and smile with incredible 
efficiency and confidence.					









 




							invisalign® aligners						


						clear invisalign teeth aligners are one of our most popular 
orthodontic treatments. by using a series of virtually 
clear, removable appliances, invisalign will straighten 
your teeth without metal bands, brackets, or wires. 
bonus: they’re removable so they don’t restrict 
what you eat.					









 




							dental bonding						


						a pliable, natural-looking material is sculpted and 
bonded to teeth to cover stains, small gaps, visible 
cracks, and chips, and to replace silver-colored 
fillings. ask us about this one-appointment, 
affordable smile solution.					









 




							dentures						


						a missing tooth – or teeth – can be devastating to self 
image and enjoyment of life. dentures can change 
that. if you’re missing teeth, from one tooth to a 
full upper or lower arch, talk to us. let’s 
change your life!					









 




							root canal treatment						


						root canal treatment (or endodontics) focuses on 
disease or injury of tooth pulp – the soft tissue 
inside your teeth. modern dentistry allows for 
comfortable treatment that relieves pain
 and saves smiles.
