i am a xaverian clipper
“xaverian provides me with the unique opportunity to excel in all of my academic and extracurricular endeavors. academically, i have the ability to take an expansive selection of courses in the steam fields and have the ability to partake in a number of pre-professional pathways as well as hobby-related clubs. furthermore, one  of the most unique and enriching programs that xaverian has to offer is music at xaverian (max.) max gives me the unparalleled experience of performing at a number of venues and sharing the gift of musicianship through a plethora of community and international organizations. i am proud to say xaverian has challenged me to be a multifaceted leader and provides me with the resources to rise to every occasion. xaverian undoubtedly cultivates an environment of excellence that radiates through my disciplines in the classroom, on the stage, and beyond.” - christopher ledoux ‘24learn more about max













i am a xaverian clipper
“being a clipper has taught me how to seamlessly integrate my faith into everything i do, be it academics or athletics. at xaverian, i have been encouraged to analyze ideas, reflect on events, and evaluate outcomes through a spiritual perspective – understanding more deeply the role god plays in my life. through my involvement in softball, basketball, and campus ministry, i have learned how to better serve others and better connect with god. i am excited to experience the immersion and service retreats that lie ahead for me.” -rylee thompson ‘26













i am a xaverian clipper
“xaverian has offered me an opportunity to excel both in the classroom and on the field. being a student-athlete at xaverian has taught me and prepared me for my future endeavors. as an honor roll student taking advanced classes, i was worried that time management would be an issue. however, with the consideration of my teachers and other staff members at xaverian, i was able to prioritize my schoolwork while still being able to compete on the field and enjoy time to myself. the academic program at xaverian pushes students to their fullest potential day in and day out. this community allows us to strive and get the most out of xaverian.  at xaverian, we truly do form a familial community with our peers. this place has become my home, and i’m excited for what else is to come.” -michael arndt ‘25













i am a xaverian clipper
“as a student-athlete at xaverian, i am focused on my studies throughout the day and my after school hours are spent on training, getting to games, and meeting the required fitness goals in order to be able to play. practices after school allow me to build my skill set, manage my time, yet also understand the true meaning of being a part of the soccer program at xaverian. being welcomed into xaverian as an incoming freshmen has brought me joy, comfort, opportunities to build friendships, excel academically, and grow as a swimmer and soccer player. i can’t wait to see what the future holds! i will forever cherish the memories that are being made here. i am beyond grateful to be a clipper, and proud to be a part of the rich history of xaverian.” - olivia anzurez ‘27
