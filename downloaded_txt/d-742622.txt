for those of you who are new to ann ringness / leather, i have been a minnesota leather artisan since 1974 and my leather bags are classic and functional. i hand cut each piece one by one and each hide is unique. i offer free cleaning/refurbishing services for purchased bags. as art shows progress and every piece is handmade, i update sold pieces when returning home. most “sold out” pieces can be reproduced so please contact me if you are interested.

thank you for your continuing support and the all the friendships i have developed over these many years!  feel free to call if you have any questions on images posted, or products that you have purchased in the past and are not uploaded yet. i have a gallery of my bags set up in my home, please feel free to stop in by appointment.   320-252-0156. cell: 320-492-6554.
