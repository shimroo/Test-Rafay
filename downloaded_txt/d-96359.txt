the video from our relaunch zoom conference is processing and will be loaded to the website shortly for those who were not able to get on the call.
after 25 years, the door finally opened! welcome!

if you have visited our website in the past, you will notice it seems fairly simple right now. that is by design.  we wanted there to be no confusion with our new mission and vision. with all the information on autism and related issues, we decided to simplify the message to help people focus on one step at a time. unlocking autism is also planning on launching an online community where we can easily communicate and interact in real-time.  make sure you join the newsletter to stay up-to-date.
