the invisible gardener  



over fifty years of magic. the invisible gardener’s touch digs deep from soil rejuvenation to optimal vegetation abundance. he’s the integral, unseen, harmonious piece of the landscape, like the space between breaths. andy’s attentive and wholistic connection to growth understands maximum potential. whatever is in the garden has its place. and for andy, the invisible gardener, his place at the table has been set even before the seed sprouts. his wonderment of life’s cycles is an earthly treasure.
