what people are saying:



“elizabeth decker of hello dolly real estate recently helped us sell our family home in highland, ny after our mother passed away. there was a lot to attend to, from upgrading the electrical service to clearing out old furniture. in every case, dolly knew the right person for the job, and was on hand to make sure everything was attended to properly. because we were not available to oversee everything ourselves, we had to rely on ms. decker. we put our trust in her and were more than happy with the results. her performance, reliability, and resourcefulness were exceptional. i highly recommend hello dolly real estate.”— michele c.“we feel so fortunate to have met stefan when we first started looking for a place in the hudson valley three years ago. from that first viewing, for which he happily drove us around a snowy apple orchard in his minivan, to our last, stefan stuck with us, assuring us that it *would* eventually happen (something we needed to hear a few times!). he effortlessly balances warmth and joviality with professionalism, and he is clearly super knowledgeable and knows everyone in the business in the area. stefan genuinely cares about finding the right place for you, and that made a world of difference for such a big life decision.”— polly cancro“we really lucked out in finding stefan!! he made our home-buying experience a calm, grounded, fun, educational, supportive and surprisingly simple process, walking us through every step with confidence and expert advice. cheers to a real swell guy...who wears awesome socks!!:-) joanna and michael”— michael cuddire“my wife and i worked with stefan to purchase and sell residential real estate. his knowledge of the local market is excellent and his experience in the real estate transaction process is evident. on top of this, he is seemingly always available for a quick chat and is very responsive via text or email. he would certainly be my top pick if i were to consider another property in ulster county and would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone else looking for a competent, professional, and personable realtor.”— allen labulis“my wife and i were lucky to skim the cream of stefan’s 20+ years of local market experience. and his strong relationships with the local players was invaluable. several words and phrases come to mind when thinking of stefan: advocacy, integrity, communicative, proactive, prompt and "above and beyond." he also flagged some "cons" to properties that we should consider, which i’m not sure if other brokers would have done for a buyer who is in love with a property. our real estate transaction had some unexpected, stressful turns and involved a lot of big personalities. stefan deftly navigated, defused situations, found solutions, and privately was a voice of reason. oh, and he negotiated a good deal. and it helps that he’s a good humored, intelligent, wonderful guy to be around, with an infectious laugh.”— herschel thompson“stefan is an overall great realtor. he has there rare ability to see purchases from an investors point of view and point out problems & solutions that others may not see. he has been really helpful even after we completed the purchase and provided contacts to set us up for success for the long term.great person to know in the real estate business. highly recommended.”— alexan kartalyan



“stefan bolz helped us buy a home recently and we cannot recommend him and hello dolly more. he was very knowledgeable throughout the process and helped us through some hiccups along the way. stefan was very responsive and kept us updated throughout every step. highly recommend hello dolly.”— katherine s.“i don’t normally post reviews - good or bad. however, hello dolly real estate made such an impression that i had to share. amy, stefan and dolly herself made finding a place such a stress free experience after a year+ of trying different options. friendly, professional, knowledgeable and diligent.i can’t speak highly enough or recommend them more. my experience working with them all was such a positive experience that i will absolutely use hello dolly for all of my real estate needs in the future.thumbs up, highly recommend, 10/10!!thanks so much for all your help.”— darren marc“we can't say enough good things about hello dolly realty and specifically our realtor deborah. they are extremely knowledgeable and went above and beyond to assist us with purchasing our house. deborah was always available, professional and did everything she could to make it a smooth process as much as possible. we wouldn't hesitate in recommending them as a local, honest and friendly real estate team.”— verity howell“i’ve bought and sold several homes and have never had an agent go above and beyond like stefan and the hello dolly team did. with me being out of state they helped more than what i expected and i would strongly strongly recommend them for any real estate transactions in the the hudson valley.”— nick kohli“dolly helped me during a very stressful time when i was struggling to sell a house that was left to me by a long time dear friend. when i met with her initially she asked me when i wanted to sell the house, and i answered "tomorrow." two months later the closing took place and i was more than satisfied with the final offer she was able to negotiate. she answers her own phone and is readily available for questions and concerns. i would recommend dolly to anyone looking to resolve a real estate issue. she's the best!”— theresa steegmuller“i’ve used stefan for two commercial purchases and he’s always extremely helpful and very responsive. he works to make sure you get the best deal not have to settle. i’ll continue to use him for my investments.”— steven kuveikis“stefan helped us both with the sale of our house and purchase of a new one! in addition to being very charming and having a fabulous sense of humor, he is highly communicative and very responsive. he really listened to our concerns and gave excellent advise all throughout the process. when looking for our new place, he listened to our needs and worked to help us find the right place. i would recommend him to anyone getting into the real estate market.”—beth selig“dolly and her staff are 100% in the know about local properties and always ready to answer questions or show you properties!”— shelley kinsch
