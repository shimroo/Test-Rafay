oneapi ecosystem
the unified acceleration (uxl) foundation sets the open specification, with input
                                and collaboration from across the industry via special interest groups (sigs).
                                anyone can get involved with these sigs -
                                join and
                                    participate in the foundation.
individual organizations can then create their own implementations of the oneapi
                                specification. intel has developed their own implementation of this specification,
                                and we have developed several plugins for this implementation. these are our
                                nvidia/amd compatibility plugins, and our recently open sourced oneapi
                                construction kit.

oneapi for nvidia®/amd
the oneapi plugins for nvidia and amd bring all the benefits of heterogeneous computing
                                to your hardware. the plugins are used along with intel's oneapi base toolkit and
                                is also compatible with a wide range of oneapi libraries. 
furthermore, these plugins have been fully open sourced, allowing you to build them
                                for your own implementation of oneapi.

oneapi construction kit
the oneapi construction kit brings oneapi and the sycl open standard to new and
                                custom hardware. it is a framework with accompanying software components, tutorials
                                and a risc-v reference platform â all curated by our own expert developers, showing
                                you how to implement oneapi and sycl on your own hardware.

aero aims to complement the efforts of the epi project by developing the open-source
                                software ecosystem required to not only improve the efficiency of the epi hardware
                                but also accelerate and ease the processorâs integration into the cloud.







project focused on advancing ai/data mining for extremely large and diverse data
                                for europe and beyond, by democratizing its acceleration through open standards
                                and a healthy, competitive, and innovating ecosystem.
