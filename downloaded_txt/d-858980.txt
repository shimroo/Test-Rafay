danica patrick: crossing the line review





patrick, danica, danica patrick: crossing the line. danica patrick's life moves at 220 mph. she drives every race and lives every day like she has something to prove -- and she does. this 5-foot 2-inch, 100-pound woman, has had to qualify a little quicker and race a little faster than the boys. and this is just to earn all those guys respect or she would otherwise be given if she weren't the "girl on the track, driving the princess mobile."  she's had to defend herself, her skill, her ability, and her gender. she and no other professional indycar driver is a joke. even the indycar drivers who stay at the back of the pack are skilled and capable, but the back of the pack is the last place that she wants to be -- on the track or in life. she is a small-town girl from beloit, wi.  and she has had a big-boy dream and a family who helped her believe that anything was possible. her drive and hard work is paying off and keeps showing people, you can do whatever you set your mind to, that you can rise to any challenge, and that what makes you different is what makes you great. in this great new book danica patrick in crossing the line shares it all.  she shares secrets and stories, tales from the track, and insights into her personal life that reveal the spirit and drive packed into this all-star athlete and woman. from the start on the first go-kart at age ten through her sensational rookie season that turned indy racing in "danica mania", she invites readers into her life. she takes us through her early racing years, competing against the boys she now beats as men, and her livestyle in england, battling insults, homesickness, and injury. she talks about havine the best crew, all the support that bobby rahal shows her, and adjusting to the frenetic pace and attention of "danica mania." through all this, she's been blessed with a close-knit family and has been fortunate enough to find true love. she competes on a man's level and in a man's sport. this book details her extraordinary rise from a ten-year-old go-kart champion to a twenty-three-year-old indy star, and her unique perspective on how to compete in life, how to stand out, and how to get the respect and attention we deserve

danica patrick earns us sports academy awards





danica patrick earns us sports academy awardsindianapolis, monday, jan. 2, 2006 -- danica patrick made history last may by becoming the first woman to lead the indianapolis 500, a performance that was remembered by sports fans and media during year-end awards voting.patrick, who became the highest-finishing woman ever in the indianapolis 500, was named female athlete of the year by the united states sports academy after dominating a worldwide internet election hosted by usatoday.com. patrick also was runner-up in media voting for the associated press female athlete of the year, trailing only golf superstar annika sorenstam.patrick also ranked no. 6 among 30 athletes in fan voting at espn.com in the "who was the ultimate face of 2005, sportsnation?" poll.indycar® series rookie patrick electrified the sports world in may after qualifying fourth for the 89th indianapolis 500, leading three times for 19 laps and finishing fourth after a thrilling late-race duel with eventual winner dan wheldon. she was named jpmorgan chase bank indianapolis 500 rookie of the year.the athlete of the year is the culmination of the sports academy's year-long athlete of the month program, which recognizes the accomplishments of men and women in any sport around the globe on a monthly basis. tennis star kim clijsters finished second in the women's balloting, followed by sorenstam.in the ap poll, other athletes receiving votes behind sorenstam and patrick included tennis players maria sharapova, venus williams and clijsters, golfer michelle wie, swimmer natalie coughlin and basketball player sheryl swoopes.the espn.com poll asked fans to vote on the athletes who made the biggest headlines in 2005. the only athletes to finish ahead of patrick were, in order, nfl wide receiver terrell owens, cyclist lance armstrong, football player reggie bush, basketball player ron artest and football coach charlie weis.in another salute to patrick's performance at indianapolis, fox nascar analyst darrell waltrip named the 89th indianapolis 500 as the race of the year in his year-end column for foxsports.com.three-time nascar champion waltrip wrote: "we've all talked about the exciting races of the year in nascar, but one of the most exciting races that i saw in 2005 was the indy 500 with danica patrick leading and finishing fourth. it was as good as it gets. she spun out and had trouble in the pits, but she was there at the end of the day when it was time to decide who was going to win the race. she battled it out with eventual race winner dan wheldon and three or four of the top drivers in the series to see who was going to go to victory lane. it was as good a race as i've seen."of course, the irl cars put on an incredible show any time they go to the mile-and-a-half tracks, but danica's indy 500 was one race that got me really excited. it was the lead-in to the coca-cola 600 on fox so i sat and watched it, and i thought it was a pretty exciting race."

danica patrick pic, danica patrick photo





danica patrick talks with crew chief steve melson after practice for the rolex 24 auto race at daytona international speedway, in daytona beach, fla., in this jan. 27, 2006. (ap photo/terry renna)rusty wallace speaking highly of danica patrick! rusty wallace stated he is expecting big things out of danica patrick. i made a comment the other day which i really believe. when i was asked if she was going to win, i said, "hell yeah, she's going to win." i drove with her at the 24 hours of daytona; she's really into the chassis of the car. she's deeply involved in the setup. i got firsthand knowledge of working with her at daytona which proved to me she is the real deal. i've seen a lot of lady race car drivers, but she is the real deal.i do wish both open-wheel organizations could get back together and create a bigger open-wheel sport, but that's up to the powers that be. that's something that probably desperately needs to happen, and i hope all the parties can come together and make it happen one of these days.

danica patrick's starting line





 * most of the time we interview ultrafit superstars or maybe-not-so-incredibly-fit personalities who have started training. yet our favorite (and riskiest) profiles are the byproduct of keeping our eyes peeled for people off the cultural radar who seem to have a certain something that embodies what this magazine is all about.  * back in november 2003, some readers were surprised when we wrote about a 5'1", 100-pound female racecar driver. danica patrick may have been obscure at the time, but we could tell she was headed somewhere bigger than her next race.  asked then what had made bobby rahal predict she could win the indy 500 one day, she said: "if i set out to do something, i don't see letting down as an option. usually, when things get bad, i push harder."  * we didn't expect her to become (arguably) the biggest sports story of the year, but we weren't surprised, either. as everyone knows by now, patrick, 23, only the fourth woman to race at indy, finished fourth in the may 2005 event after leading with eight laps to go.  * congratulations, danica, on your achievement, and for proving yet again what this magazine has always preached--the only real limits to what you can accomplish are those that you place on yourself. you go fast, girl.copyright 2005 weider publicationscopyright 2005 gale group
