  st. pio of pietrelcina, pray for us!

padre pio, also known as st. pio of pietrelcina was a capuchin friar, priest, and mystic who lived in italy until his death in 1967. padre pio is remembered for his charity and piety, as well as his ability to levitate. he is also one of few stigmatics in the church. after seeing a vision of jesus on september 20, 1918, padre pio found the stigmata on his hands, feet, and side. after this, people came by the hundreds to see him. due to his declining health, padre pio rarely left the friary and spent his time hearing confessions and blessing the sick. padre pio was canonized by pope saint john paul ii in 2002.

patron saint of civil defense volunteers, stress relief, and adolescents.
