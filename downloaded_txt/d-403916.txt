an afghan joining method to crochet…

 

© 2006 drew emborsky, the crochet dude™



 

use this joining method to put together an afghan with the 12” squares of your choice!  just use the same hook size and yarn weight that you made the squares with.

 

with right side facing:



 

rnd 1:  join with a sc in the second st of any corner.  2 sc in same space. work 38 sc evenly on each side of square, working 3 sc in each corner st.  slip st to first sc.  (164 sc)

 

rnd 2:  ch 3, (dc, ch 5, dc) in next st.  * dc in next st. (ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next 2 sts) 9 times, ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next st, (dc, ch 5, dc) in next st. * three times.  dc in next st. (ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next 2 sts) 9 times, ch 3, slip st to top of beginning ch 3.  fasten off.  (88 dc)






 

continue with the next square and with right side facing:

 

rnd 1:  join with a sc in the second st of any corner.  2 sc in same space. work 38 sc evenly on each side of square, working 3 sc in each corner st.  slip st to first sc.  (164 sc)

 

rnd 2:  ch 3, (dc, ch 5, dc) in next st.  dc in next st. (ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next 2 sts) 9 times, ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next st, (dc, ch 5, dc) in next st, dc in next st.  ch 2, remove hook from loop.  insert hook through first ch 3 space of any side of first square and through loop, pulling the ch 2 through slightly, ch 1, skip 2 sts on second square, dc in next 2 sts. * ch 2, remove hook from loop.  insert hook through next ch 3 space of first square and through loop, pulling the ch 2 through slightly, ch 1, skip 2 sts on second square, dc in next 2 sts.* 8 times.  ch 2, remove hook from loop.  insert hook through next ch 3 space of first square and through loop, pulling the ch 2 through slightly, ch 1, skip 2 sts on second square, dc in next st, (dc, ch 5, dc) in next st.   dc in next st. (ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next 2 sts) 9 times.  ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next st, (dc, ch 5, dc) in next st. dc in next st. (ch 3, skip 2 sts, dc in next 2 sts) 9 times.  ch 3, skip 2 sts, slip st to top of beginning ch 3.  fasten off and weave in ends.

 

 

repeat the joining method as described for the second square, joining sides of squares whenever they meet.  the corners of squares are joined the same way using the corners that meet diagonally from each other, however you ch 3 before pulling the loop through the other corner, then ch 2 to complete the joining before working the next st.







 

once all the squares are joined, border the entire afghan.

 

rnd 1:  join with a slip st in any corner space.  ch 3, (dc, ch 3, 2 dc) in same space.  *@ (ch 2, dc in next 2 dc) 11 times.  ch 2, in order to join the corner loops of the two squares, take the corner loop of the square on the left and put it behind the corner loop of the square on the right.  work 2 dc in space just created. @ repeat from @ to @ across.  ch 2, (2 dc, ch 3, 2 dc) in corner space. *  three times. @ (ch 2, dc in next 2 dc) 11 times.  ch 2, in order to join the corner loops of the two squares, take the corner loop of the square on the left and put it behind the corner loop of the square on the right.  work 2 dc in space just created. @ repeat from @ to @ across. ch 2, slip st to top of beginning ch 3.

monet afghan








i called this afghan “monet” because the colors look like an impressionist painting. i suggest making this afghan in any color, either solid or variegated, because the texture of the stitches make it special. the finished afghan measures approximately 46”x66”.

click here for free pdf download now available! 
monet afghan
©2005 drew emborsky, aka the crochet dude

each square measures 13” x 13”






make 12:

materials: worsted weight yarn – (shown in red heart "water lily")
i used one 6 oz skein for each square (it's important not to start a new skein in the middle of the square because of the patterning of the colors)
and two 8 oz skeins of white for the joining and the border
size h crochet hook

row 1: ch 47, sc in second ch from hook and in each ch across. (46 sc)

row 2: ch 1, (sc, 2 dc) in first st, *skip 2 sc, (sc, 2 dc) in next st * across. sc in last st.






row 3-33: ch 1, (sc, 2 dc) in each single crochet across ending with a sc in the last st.

row 34, sc in each st across. do not fasten off. sc evenly around square working 3 sc in each corner. fasten off.






join squares together using a simplified lattice technique (origin unknown) as follows:

rnd 1: with contrasting color join with a sc in any corner, work 2 more sc in same st, work 47 sc on each side and work 3 sc in each corner. join with a slip st.

rnd 2: slip st into corner st. ch1, (sc, ch 4, sc) in same st. (ch 3, skip 2 sc, sc in next st) around, working (sc, ch 4, sc) in each corner st. slip st to first sc, fasten off.

lay the squares out in a 3 by 4 pattern. first join squares together to make three long strips with four squares each. then join the three strips together to create ghan. join by making a sc in corner loop, ch 3, sc in corresponding loop on opposite square. ch 3, sc in next loop of first square, ch 3, sc in corresponding loop of opposite square, and so on back and forth.

once joined, edge entire afghan by working three rounds of (sc, ch 3) in each loop.
