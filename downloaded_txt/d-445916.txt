digitally remastered in 1080p hd

 

one six right was filmed using the panavision / sony f900 1080/24p digital cinema camera — a high-end camera still used today.the technical limitations of dvds, however, display less than 20% of the camera's resolution. now, for the first time on blu-ray, the full 1080p image can be experienced on your hdtv.we went back to the original camera masters and re-digitized every frame. we remastered each shot to their full quality using tools that were not available when the film was first released.
