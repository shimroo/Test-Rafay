						meet the staff					


						arlene thornton & associates is a boutique talent agency located in the san fernando valleyÂ with 35+ years of experience in the entertainmentÂ industry.					















 




						on camera department					


						our on camera department focuses mainly on commercials but does offer theatrical representation on a case by case basis. because we are a boutique agency by design, our on camera department keeps a tight roster in order to enable us the ability to tailor our representation to the needs of each specific actor instead of the industry standard blanket approach. the majority of our talent is sag/aftra, though we do occasionally represent non-union talent looking to grow their careers. 					









 




						need representation?					


						if you're looking for representation with our agency you must submit your demos, resume & current headshot(s) for consideration. 
we are open to union and non-union talent.
