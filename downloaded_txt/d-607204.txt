patient testimonials


i am happy that san dimas is an amazing community hospital that is here for my needs.jordan s.  my mom’s nurse, zeny, is great! she took care of me when i was in the hospital years ago, and now she is taking care of my mom. she’s just as wonderful now as she was then. i know we have a lot of options, but we choose to come to san dimas community hospital.rey r.  my leg was saved by an excellent orthopedic surgeon at san dimas community hospital. just seven weeks post-surgery, i’m already cycling for 20 minutes without any issues. i’m grateful for my surgeon and mckena, operating room director, her team, and the wonderful individuals at san dimas community hospital.thomas m.  i have been here almost a week and i already feel very attached to the staff. i enjoy their spontaneity and how i can joke around with them and be myself, particularly with my physical therapist, todd, and my nurse, michelle, who have been extremely kind and has the best personality. the same lady, who cleans my room every morning, asks me how my day is going. i am very extraverted, and these small day to day interactions make such a difference.monika m.  i’m weary about new hospitals because i am chronically ill and have my “usuals”. i came here hoping for good care with low standards, but the nurses and doctors were awesome. i was in and out fast, and cared for really well. i can’t really ask for more. i appreciated all of the staff a lot.abby fellows  great doctors and staff. they provided great service and care during my stay.anaalicia orozco  honestly think this is the nicest hospital i’ve ever been to.  my wife and i had our baby here and the staff were amazing.  highly recommend!ak kist
