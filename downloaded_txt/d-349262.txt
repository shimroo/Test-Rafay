on the platform with tiffiny carlson



chris kerr is such a cool lady. i met her (online) last year, and have admired her amazing adventurous life since making her acquaintance. she is half a world away from me (australia), and has an adult daughter and husband. sheâ€™s been injured for decades and hasnâ€™t let her injury stop her from living her life her way (my kind of lady). she was kind enough to do a writeup on me for platform stories, a site in australia sharing bios of women with disabilities to lift up other women with disabilities. thank you so much chris! read the article here

why i will not be watching the sex & city reboot



for all i know, kim cattrall doesnâ€™t even want to be involved in the reboot, but i feel possessed to say something. this was the first tv show i binged after all. it holds a special place in my heart, but samantha holds an even deeper space in my heart. like deep, deep. just call her samantha, the heart miner.
as a young twentysomething woman, this show literally showed me, and women all around the globe, what our sex lives were capable of whether that be good or bad, but in samanthaâ€™s case, it was always a very good thing. she was the best character in the show. and iâ€™m not just saying that because iâ€™m also blonde and have been known to have a voracious sexual appetite.
no. kim cattrallâ€™s portrayal of a financially and sexually independent woman in her 40â€™s (gasp), was unheard of in any other arena of media at the time. and honestly, i canâ€™t think of any other character that has been portrayed since samantha that has been better when it comes to possessing these fierce fucking qualities.
samantha in many ways made the world better for women. while the other characters wiled away, pining for a husband or crying over over a man that said goodbye on a post-it, samantha was on the offense at all times. she never let a manâ€™s ineptitude veer her off her goals in life. eh-hemâ€¦now why isnâ€™t she returning again?
sure, carrie, charlotte and miranda are all adorable and look great in clothes, and iâ€™ll admit, i squeed when their storylines had a happy ending just like every other person watching, but do i really care whatâ€™s going right now in their lives? nah. the only character i honestly would love to see are right now is samantha, and unfortunately sheâ€™s not going to be in the reboot. iâ€™m afraid jason matheson from the jason show is right, and sheâ€™ll probably be killed off in the first episode in some funeral scene while the other ladies sit around her coffin wearing luxe black designer clothes and big sunglasses.
there are rumors that sarah jessica parker did not get along with kim cattrall in real life, which is why samantha jones will not be in the new series. really? are they that immature to forgo such a monumental and important character over on-set emotions? who knows what the truth is. only those who are involved know. all i know is that samantha wonâ€™t be in the reboot while so many minor characters areâ€¦and i simply cannot observe this travesty. my heart is broken.
now excuse me while i go watch mannequin.

whereâ€™s the power wheelchair art?



there is an amazing trend going on in the wheelchair world right now â€“ the crocheted wheel covers being made by dutch designer simeli.nl. these are fantastic and beautiful in every way. they make me want to take my old manual chair out of storage, dust it off, and buy a pair. sadly however, iâ€™ve been a full-time power wheelchair-user for years and these lovely wheel covers wonâ€™t work on my spoke-less wheels.
power wheelchairs get no love. the beautifying accessories available to our cross-section of the universe are far and few between. do you know of any power wheelchair accessories that enhance their aesthetic appeal? am i uninformed about some amazing powerchair pouff that exists unbeknownst to me? ðŸ˜‰ please share in the comments below.

congrats to ali stroker! <3



having briefly met ali 6 years ago at an adaptive yoga conference on rainy saturday, iâ€™m thrilled to see her career flourish! she won a tony award last sunday for her role as ado annie in oklahoma! and shattered the glass ceiling for actors in wheelchairs, becoming the first wheelchair-user to win a tony. hereâ€™s a bio i wrote on her this week for spinalpedia 
congrats ali!
