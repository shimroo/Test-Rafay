my work, your work and 
        a whole load of books!



 

 welcome
to my site.  i am lynne, also 
                    known as mini-mum due to being a mum of two with a love for 
                    all things mini. i live in the uk. my interests particularly 
                    include 1/12th scale miniatures, but i also have a fascination 
                    for things like the tiniest of dolls within a set of nesting 
                    dolls. 
out of all the crafts that i have 
                    tried i find that i return time and again to my great love 
                    of hand sewing.  even 
                    in this area i have worked with mini pieces -my millennium 
                    project was a quilt "scrap happy' with 25,000 pieces. 
                    embroideries and quilts large and small can be found on my 
                    pages. knitting is another favourite interest which i started 
                    doing in mini at the beginning of 2003. click on the sweater 
                    photo below to go straight there
christmas decorations, another mini interest 
                    of mine are featured in their own section. nesting dolls are 
                    nestled on the site on the this 'n that page.
'other crafts' covers anything else i 
                    have experimented with other than sewing.
 

2010
lots more knits put up here. the photos 
                    are in the process of being re photographed and this is a 
                    temporary page. new knits made this year have been marked. 
                    i have yet to add all the little sweaters to it.

                    style of a stained glass window. this is 90% finished now, 
                    having started it in august 2009

 i 
                    hope you enjoy the bookshops. i don't hold any stock as these 
                    are in association with amazon.com and amazon.co.uk. you can 
                    be assured of their excellent sales and service. i have tried 
                    to display a selection of the most useful or interesting books 
                    for each category of this site. do 
                    click through on the book titles and buy one or ten!! the 
                    commision from the sales will help me have a mini-mum wage. 
                    lol
as regards my own craftwork, this site 
                    is almost entirely show and tell, with only occasional items 
                    made by me for sale.
enjoy!
