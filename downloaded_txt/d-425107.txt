film 
             -  movies



initially, moving 
              pictures meant only the movement that is perceived when a string 
              of celluloid - recorded images are projected at a rate of 16 or more 
              frames per second (see persistence of vision). today, motion pictures 
              (or "movies") are an art form, as well as one of the most 
              popular forms of entertainment. 
              a feature film is usually defined as being more than 60 minutes 
              in length. 
originally moving 
              picture film was shot at a nominal 16 frames per second, but was 
              changed to 24 frames per second with the introduction of sound. 
              other improvements since the late 1800s include the mechanization 
              of cameras, allowing them to record at a consistent speed, the invention 
              of more sophisticated film stocks, allowing directors to film in 
              increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synch sound 
              - , allowing sound to be recorded at the same speed as its corresponding 
              video. since the advent of many other media technologies, film may 
              include a broad range of media - - both linear and non - linear, 
              dramatic and informational, motion and still (though progressive).
