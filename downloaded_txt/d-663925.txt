a rally witha purpose 

bikes,
blues, and bbq is  501c3 non-profit
motorcycle rally with a purpose that benefits women, children, and the
underserved members of the northwest arkansas community.  since the first bikes,
blues, and bbq we have donated in excess of $3 million to local charities.  bikes, blues, and bbq has always taken pride
in being a family friendly event that is inclusive of all people in our society.  bikes, blues, and bbq in no way condones, accepts
or tolerates racism, sexism, intolerance, anti-semitism, white supremacy or
hate speech.
ride on
and ride safe. rally info
