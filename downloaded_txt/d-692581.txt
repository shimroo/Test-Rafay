          embedded developers with niche skills are like gold dust.

if you find one, don’t hesitate... hire them quickly. 

i see over and over that these specialists are often snapped up by companies that understand their value. 

that means your hiring process needs to be not just fast, but also enticing. 

competitive salaries, interesting projects, and a clear path for career growth are essential if you want to attract and retain this top talent.

speed and flexibility in hiring can make all the difference 🙏

the companies that adapt their recruitment strategies to move quickly are the ones that will come out on top.

          ☕ the coffee-driven code review manifesto: a sleep-deprived guide to excellence

[everyone talks about clean code, but let's be honest - most of our best reviews happen after that third espresso shot]

🌅 6 am: first commit

code looking pristine
tests all green
documentation spotless
reality: haven't written a single line yet

☀️ 9 am: the morning stand-up revelation "wait, did i just promise to deliver this by eod?"

frantically opens ide
types while drinking coffee
spills coffee on keyboard
git commits anyway

🌮 12 pm: the lunchtime code review

pr comment: "interesting choice of variable names. is 'pizzatime' really the best name for a payment processing function?" 
me: "i was hungry when i wrote that..."

🌙 5 pm: the final push

git commit -m "fixed everything (hopefully)" 
git push origin please-work 
git prayer --recursive

📊 our revolutionary metrics:

bugs found vs coffees consumed (1:1 ratio)
time spent reviewing vs time spent making memes about code
number of "lgtm" comments that actually meant "i trust you”

🎯 pro tips for sleep-deprived reviews:

if the code works on the fifth try, it's probably production-ready
comments like "magic. don't touch." are perfectly acceptable documentation
if you can't explain your code, blame it on the keyboard

🤔 the real code review checklist:

does it work?
no one knows why it works
but it works
ship it!

💭 question for fellow night owls: what's your record for most consecutive hours staring at a pr before realizing you were looking at the wrong branch?

          i'll be talking about building future-proof react applications on the 30th of may in bucharest. everyone needs to have a set of principles they follow so they don't have to think about every problem from scratch.

i'll tell you how i've been building react applications for the last 8 years.

what works.

what doesn't.

what to focus on to make sure you don't have to rewrite your application every year.

because programming is about solving problems.

but engineering is about maintaining those solutions over time.

          the worst code i worked with sold for $700m

it changed how i see tech:

i was an idealist:

• clean code
• thorough testing
• best architecture possible

when i saw the news, i realised i was wrong

there was value in

• 2 enormous php monoliths
• integrated over database
• without tests

the business made $1b in trades.
the software was just an automation.

business value > tech purity

          in what world would anyone use microservices, when there is a thing called monolithic architecture. 

yesterday i attended aws cloud day in prague, where they had a coffee stand where you could order coffee using their app built using microservices. from what i understood, it is a proof of concept, but i can’t see how it’s a proof of concept and not a proof, that you can indroduce a lot of useless complexity you add to a project, when you decide to use microservices.

during breaks between the lectures, i built an app, which achieves pretty much all things their app does, only without the phone number verification. it took me in total of 20 minutes to build the backend and 40 minutes to create decent frontend using htmx and tailwind css.

i simply think that 90% of projects would eliminate a lot of useless complexity, if they built their apps woth monolith architecture.

          i could not agree more. recent articles about "ghost developers' based on the number of github commits reflects an incorrect perception of how hard software developers working in different roles. i was also annoyed by the notion that somehow, there are 10% of developer's 'coasting' and getting paid hundreds of thousands. this happens in all industries not just software development. https://cstu.io/d41234

          99% of ctos i speak to avoid hiring software engineers for this reason: 

if you can’t: 

> accept constructive feedback
> talk about a project that went wrong
> take accountability for mistakes
> acknowledge contribution of others 

it’s time to reassess- fast 

less ego, more modesty

          gave a talk at work on "dependencies" today, trying to externalise and make explicit some of the background awareness that shapes my everyday practice as a software developer. it takes time for this awareness to develop. i remember the first time someone talked to me about how gradle uses a topological sort over a graph of dependencies to determine a build order for tasks, and what a revelation that was. i remember the first time i was shown how to get intellij to scan a java project for cyclic dependencies between packages, and coming to understand why one might want to avoid them and how to unpick them if they arose.

now dags (directed acyclic graphs) are a comfortable piece of my mental furniture, but i don't know that more junior developers are often directly introduced to them - they might come up as a data structure with associated algorithms in cs courses, but is it explained that they're fundamental to the way compilers and build tooling assemble working software from many related pieces? many developers are aware at some level that transitive dependencies can balloon out into bloat (and an ever-expanding attack surface for vulnerabilities), but how many can articulate this clearly?

a large part of my practice as a principal engineer is mentoring individuals and looking out for knowledge gaps in teams. it can be hard to recover a "beginner's mind" and remember what it was like not to know (or to be only vaguely aware of) something that became second nature to you over a decade ago, but it forces you to make your implicit knowledge explicit - which also gives you opportunities to reflect on it. teaching is learning: you go back and retread old paths, and are confronted again with long-forgotten questions.

like everyone at the moment, i wonder what the impact of llms is going to be on the way developers acquire the background awareness and instincts that guide accomplished practitioners. will they help to make implicit knowledge explicit, or will they paper over gaps in knowledge and obstruct the process of learning?

          a friend of mine, also a software engineer, has worked in both the usa 🇺🇸 and poland 🇵🇱. currently, he's living in warsaw, earning about $160k as a remote developer for a us-based startup.

he spent a decade in new york city 🗽 before moving to warsaw a few years ago. 

recently, missing nyc's vibrancy and social life, he returned there for a few months to evaluate a potential comeback.

he’s quite progressive—think polyamory and burning man—so it might seem that nyc would suit him better than the more traditional, yet modern, warsaw.

yet, after spending a few months back in the big apple, he found its high pace and constant hustle too stressful for long-term living.

the root issue? nyc’s high cost of living, which forces everyone into a perpetual hustle to stay afloat. 

even though he could aim for jobs paying between $200k and $500k, the significant increase in monthly expenses—like a bigger flat, childcare, and other family needs—wouldn't effectively boost his purchasing power.

moreover, high-paying tech jobs in high-cost-of-living (hcol) areas often come with intense pressure to deliver substantial roi, adding to workplace stress.

additionally, the risk of job loss, which many engineers in the us have experienced recently, could drastically impact his financial stability, given the minimal social security support in the us — a stark contrast to other hcol places like switzerland 🇨🇭, which offer more substantial safety nets.

despite the potential for higher salaries in nyc, the financial and emotional toll seems too great. 

he's now considering remaining a remote worker in warsaw or possibly moving to lisbon or barcelona for a more progressive environment, where even a lower salary could support a comfortable lifestyle without the constant grind.

he seems to be prioritizing peace of mind over chasing higher earnings in a high-stress environment, especially considering that a higher salary wouldn’t necessarily enhance his purchasing power.

what do you think? 

is the trade-off of a high salary worth the relentless pace and high cost of living in a city like nyc? 

do engineers in lcol experience great purchasing power while keeping living costs low, and live a more relaxed life?

check out my other 2 posts on this topic of remote work, purchasing power, offshoring and quality of life. links in comments.

if you ask me, i'd also make the same choice he did, especially when considering a long-term solution. 💆‍♂️ 👍

          unpopular opinion:

it's not the software devs who need convincing.
selling devs on tbd, tdd, ci/cd, and ensemble programming, is a waste of time.

we need instead to focus on continuous feedback.
we need to sell it to the higher ups.
to the people who call the shots.

because in the end, the aim of these tools and processes is to decrease the time it takes for us to collect valuable feedback from customers.

once the c-level people are sold on the merits of fast feedback, software devs will quickly learn how to write and deliver quality code.

          many of us are working on exciting projects but only few succeed. 

during my attendance to two european ruby conferences in june, i had the opportunity to ask top ruby developers this crucial question: why do software projects fail?

these are some great insights they shared on common pitfalls, unexpected challenges, and lessons learned from project failures .

          developers/engineers: what's your preferred cloud stack for side projects?

i've recently embarked on an ambitious side project, where i'm using nextjs/postgres as the base. i don't want to pay anything to run it, but i do want to be able to share it with a small audience for testing.

i've gone for the following setup:

- vercel (frontend / api / postgres)
- firebase (auth / cloud storage)
- cloudflare (dns / security)

all of these have free tiers that provide more than enough scope for development & testing. however, i'm not sure i'd want to launch anything with this setup. i've heard too many horror stories of running up huge cloud bills by accident. fixed cost vms seem like a safer option.

tell me your favoured setup down below.

          developers use boolean logic operators on a daily basis. while some priorities were always clear to me, others i was not sure about. this is the reason why i wrote this slide deck.

also please remember: we are programmers, not mathematicians. always use as many lines and comments as needed to write better understandable code!

          82% of ctos underestimate the true cost of local developers.

that $80k developer? they actually cost $180k/year:
	•	$120k: benefits, equipment, and overhead
	•	$25k: management
	•	$20k: recruitment
	•	$15k: training

but it doesn’t stop there. hidden costs pile up:

⏳ time wastage
	•	6 months to reach full productivity
	•	1st week is pure onboarding
	•	team slows down for training

💸 operational costs
	•	$2k/month: office space
	•	$500/month: software licenses
	•	$1.5k/month: it support

📉 opportunity costs
	•	slow hiring = delayed launches
	•	competitors ship 2x faster
	•	6-month delay = $300k+ in lost revenue

the solution? offshore development teams.

          sometimes when we think about technical debt, the immediate reaction is to want to stamp it out. fix things, upgrade everything, refactor. now.

but sometimes you have to pause and ask: will an application gain value when we refactor it?

try flipping that question around: does a badly written app have enough value that it's worth refactoring?

maybe that's the question you need to ask.

          what developers won't tell you about ai replacing them

last week i deep dived into the world of ai development with cursor, replit, v0 by vercel + some others. 

i'm a person who always comes up with ideas that can solve my own problems. be it crossfit workout tracker or personalized meditations based on life events – i come up with solutions all the time. 

so when i saw 🃏 sherry jiang's announcement on the ai coding course (and signed up for it), greg isenberg's interview with riley brown (joined his seniorswc community), i naturally got attracted to the idea of developing without full coding skills. 

after a week of researching i conclude the following (for now!): 
✅ it's here, and it's here to stay
✅ for now it's a bit tricky if you have absolute 0 knowledge
✅ ai will not fully replace developers for some time 
✅ but it will get super close with further advancements
✅ it will improve dramatically, and enable everyone to create

all in all, it's super easy to create a simple product (limited stack, but good to start with), but you will struggle like crazy with more complicated products. i'm sure development will become much faster and easier with new openai releases – just look at the recent announcements, and watch the video. 

this feels like revolution in the world of creating products. we will start with creating fully functioning mvps in hours-days without any coding experience, and will progress super fast. 

devs will hate me for this, but ai is getting very close to replacing the majority of their work. devs will start shining at orchestrating ai development work, as i see it. 

what do you think? have you tried developing products from scratch with ai? would you be interested to try? 

video creds stepan gershuni's channel, thanks!
