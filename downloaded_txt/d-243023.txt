marihuana
					shrinks lung cancer tumors

(rrc - ri) -- compound in marihuana, thc, cut lung tumor growth in half in lab animals 
	and helped prevent metastasis in others, says harvard researcher, preet. thc 
	boosts 
	anti-inflam-matory properties of endocannabinoids found on 
	lung cancer cells.
after  injections of thc mouse tumors shrank about 50 percent in  
	three weeks compared  to untreated tumors.
other research suggests thc also could help fight brain, prostate, and 
	skin cancers.

 
new pancreatic vaccine

(rrc, ri) -- doctors at johns hopkins are giving a 
	select group of patients a new pancreatic cancer vaccine after surgery and again after chemo and radiation.  
	the results appear to be  dramatic.
pancreatic cancer kills 30,000 americans annually. 
	surviving more five years with it is rare.
ron windle, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer three years ago, never imagined he'd be 
	alive and still walking hand-in-hand with his wife three years later. 
"i was 
	afraid," windle says. "i still have many things to do in life."
after surgery, chemo and radiation, he had only a 20-percent chance of 
	surviving five years...but then he enrolled in a clinical trial to test the 
	new vaccine.
daniel laheru, m.d., an oncologist at sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer 
	center at johns hopkins said that the vaccine uses a form of genetically altered cells 
	to create a molecule that lures immune cells and then retrains them to 
	recognize the tumor as cancer and fight it!
according to dr. laheru, "essentially, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize 
	pancreas cancer cells as being foreign and attack them, leaving 
	healthy cells alone."
so far, he says results have been encouraging, with  76 
	percent of patients still alive after two years, compared to only 42 percent 
	of patients who received just chemo and radiation.
windle, however, is completely cancer-free! 
"i'm sure the vaccine is why i'm here today. i've 
	had many mris and cat scans, and there's no sign of cancer. none," he says.
the vaccine is injected eight weeks after surgery and again after chemo 
	and radiation. 
another study to 
	refine the vaccine's targets will start in ri. if the results are 
	positive, john hopins will immediately apply for fda approval.

pancreatic cancer survival rates enchanced



(rrc, ri)  a multi-center 
	research trial 
	now confirms, beyond doubt, that combining chemo-therapy with radiation after surgical removal of pancreatic cancer significantly improves survival rates.

patients with pancreatic cancer, a 
	notoriously difficult-to-treat cancer with poor survival rates, have good 
	reason to be encouraged. 

the study, conducted 
at the comprehensive cancer center of wake forest 
	university baptist medical center and the centre hospitalier lyon sud in 
	france, is 
	published in the august issue of the british journal of cancer.
	
"this study built on previous research that showed that the use of a 
	particular chem-therapy agent (gemcitabine) plus radiation therapy might 
	improve survival rates for patients with this devastating cancer," said a. 
	william blackstock, m.d., associate professor of radiation oncology at wake 
	forest baptist and lead investigator.
	
the study evaluated a combination of six weeks of daily radiation therapy, 
	concurrent with twice-weekly doses of gemcitabine, followed by two cycles of 
	maintenance doses of gemcitabine alone.
	
between june 1999 and october 2003, 46 patients were evaluated. the majority (70%) had advanced pancreatic cancer (known as 
	t-3/ t-4) with involvement of the lymph nodes.
	
the median survival for all the patients in the study was 18.3 months, 
	compared to a national average of only 11 months for patients having surgery 
	alone. twenty-four percent (24%) of the study participants were still alive 
	at three years and 69% at one year. 

"the results are promising because they may reflect not only 
	longer survival of these patients, but also an improved local-regional 
	control of the disease. in addition, because lower doses of gemcitabine were 
	used, it proved to be a less toxic approach to treatment," said blackstock.
	 





better catheter option for male cancer patients


		(rrc - ri) -- so-called "indwelling catheters" are painful and 
dangerous for male patients who don't need them -- causing numerous infections, 
some of which are deadly, a recent study shows.
a new study reveals, however, that tight-fitting "condom catheters" reduce 
infection by 80 percent, are more comfortable, less likely to fall off than 
older types, and much less likely to result in death.
since 25 percent of hospitalized patients are catheterized, the study 
conclusions could have striking implications for hospital patients as well as 
those in nursing homes and other settings, according to study leader, sanjay 
saint, m.d., m.p.h., director of the patient safety enhancement program and an 
associate professor of general medicine at the u-m medical school.
saint says utis (urinary tract infections) are a common hospital problem 
that lead to fevers, prolonged stays and needless deaths.

the first-ever randomized controlled trial comparing so-called "in-dwelling" 
to "condom" catheters, showed striking declines in infection and death rates 
among men who didnt have dementia and didnt need indwelling catheterization. 
(see: july journal of the american geriatrics society).

the studys authors are samuel r. kaufman, m.a. and mary a.m. rogers, ph.d., 
of u-m and the ann arbor va, and paul d. baker, arnp, and kathleen ossenkop, 
arnp, of the va puget sound. the study was funded by the department of veterans 
affairs, the va/u-m patient safety enhancement program (psep), mentor corp., and 
the robert wood johnson clinical scholars program.

 the screen, developed by sara sukumar, ph.d. 
					and mary jo fackler, ph.d., first separates cells from 
					fluid, then sifts through their dna for chemical tags on 
					genes associated with cancer.



pancreatic cancer vaccine gives patients new hope
(rrc - ri) --  
pancreatic cancer kills 30,000 american cancer 
patients every year.  another 30,000 are newly diagnosed every year.  
chances of living more than five years with pancreatic cancer are low, but researchers 
are changing that.  ron windle, for instance, was diagnosed with pancreatic 
cancer three years ago.  doctors operated, treated him with the usual rounds 
of chemo and radiation, and told him he had a 20 percent chance of 
surviving five years.  he thought he'd be dead or, at the very least, 
incapacitated by now.  instead, he's walking hand in hand with his wife, 
and is still very much alive!  
		
why?  johns hopkins university doctors 
gave him a pancreatic cancer vaccine.  daniel laheru, m.d., of johns 
hopkins university, says the vaccine "taught" ron's immune system to recognize 
and attack pancreatic cancer cells ...leaving healthy cells alone.  
seventy-six percent of similarly vaccinated patients are still alive after 
two years, compared to 42 percent of those traditionally treated.

halting breast cancer spread
(rrc - ri) -- new york researchers say drugs targeting 
			four genes may stop breast cancer from spreading to the lungs. the 
			troublesome genes -- the ereg gene, the cox-2 gene, the mmp1 gene 
			and the mmp2 gene -- may be necessary for cancer to spread.
scientists at howard hughes medical institute and the cancer 
			biology and genetics program at new york's memorial sloan kettering 
			cancer center used three drugs, the cancer drug erbitux, the 
			anti-inflammatory drug celebrex, and an experimental 
			anti-inflammatory drug to target the four genes in mice, which had 
			been injected with breast cancer cells.
cancer cells where all four genes were inactivated had 
			difficulty growing new blood vessels and this stopped cancer from 
			spreading into the lungs. however, in mice where only one of the 
			genes was inactivated, the cancer had no trouble spreading.
clinical trials of the drug combination are being discussed. you 
			can find trials that you may be ale to participate in by using the 
			trialsfinder link on this web page.
     

reducing pancreatic cancer deaths by 50%

(rrc, ri) --  a study 
			of 2,000 people for ten years 
			reports eating certain foods reduces the risk of getting pancreatic cancer by 50 percent and helps fight 
			the nation's fourth most deadly disease, if you do get it. the fruits and vegetables that play the biggest roles:
			
1. garlic2. carrots3. cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli.4. dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale or romaine 
			lettuce (not "iceberg").5. oranges6. onions7. beans
people who ate five or more servings of these daily had the 
			lowest incidence of  pancreatic cancer by far.  
meanwhile, diets high in processed meat (sausages, luncheon 
			meats, etc.) may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer by 70 
			percent, according to a major study of 180,000 individuals published in the journal of 
			the national cancer institute. people who ate the most processed 
			meat suffered double the rate of pancreatic cancer as those who ate 
			the least.
those who ate even non-processed red meats, including pork, beef, 
			and other red meats, had a 50-percent higher risk of pancreatic 
			cancer compared to those who ate the least. 
the culprit might not be the meat, but nitrate-based 
			preservatives and the cooking method, like charcoal-grilling.


common herb hinders
			pancreatic cancer

(rrc, ri) --  triphala, 
			one of the most popular herbal preparations in the world, is used to 
			treat intestinal disorders and is typically taken with water to 
			promote appetite and digestion and to increase red blood cells.
			
now, however, a study at the university of pittsburgh cancer 
			institute suggests another use:  it also helps prevent or slow 
			the growth of  pancreatic cancer tumors! 
triphala, found in dried 
			and powdered fruits of three plants, causes pancreatic cancer cell 
			death in mice by enhancing apoptosis -- the body's normal method of 
			disposing of damaged cells.
reports presented at the annual meeting of the american assn. 
	for cancer research reveal that, triphala fed orally to mice with human pancreatic tumors was an 
			extremely effective inhibitor of the cancer process." 
sanjay k. srivastava, ph.d., lead researcher and assistant professor, 
			pharmacology dept., univ. of pittsburgh school of 
			medicine, stated, "triphala triggered the cancerous cells to die off and 
			significantly reduced the size of the tumors without causing toxic 
			side effects."
mice he grafted with human pancreatic tumors 
			were fed 1 to 2 milligrams of triphala five days a week and then 
			their tumor size and levels of apoptotic proteins in the tumors were 
			compared to those of a control group of mice that had not received 
			the herb.
			
researchers found that mice that received triphala had increased 
			proteins associated with apoptosis and smaller tumors.  
	compared to control group specimens, triphala-treated 
			tumors were half the size of those in untreated mice.
triphala, as 
			it turns out, activated tumor-suppressor genes, resulting in the 
			generation of proteins that support apoptosis, but that did not 
			negatively affect normal pancreatic cells.
"our results demonstrate that triphala has strong anticancer 
			properties given its ability to induce apoptosis in pancreatic 
			cancer cells without damaging normal pancreatic cells," said dr. 
			srivastava. "with follow-up studies, we hope to demonstrate its 
			potential use as a novel agent for the prevention and treatment of 
			pancreatic cancer.

cancer&
			supplements



excerpted from: the definitive guide to 
cancer: an integrative approach


the world of dietary supplements can be overwhelming.  the vast variety of products available and conflicting information 
			make the supplement seas hard to navigate. to help you chart your 
			course, we've done a lot of research and have compiled our findings 
			in the "integrative cancer care supplement guide". because different 
			types of cancer require different supplement programs, we'll provide 
			details about specific supplements in each of the cancer overviews. 
			
there is no question that some herbs and nutrients can stimulate 
			strong and directed immune activity, influence hormones, help 
			balance blood sugar levels, and reduce inflammation. 
			

supplements can 
			also be used to support optimal digestion, detoxification, and 
			elimination. some specific herbs and nutrients even have direct 
			anticancer effects. and finally, for those undergoing conventional 
			cancer treatments, certain supplements can help offset side effects.
			
here are some general guidelines to follow when using dietary 
			supplements:


herbs and nutrients can interact 
				with other drugs, so be sure to consult with a qualified 
				integrative health-care practitioner such as a naturopathic 
				physician or pharmacist about potential interactions and contra 
				indications. 


always tell your physicians which 
				herbs and nutrients you are taking; even if they aren't familiar 
				with your supplements, they need to know that you're taking 
				additional substances. 


the quality of supplements is 
				variable; consult with a knowledgeable integrative health-care 
				provider such as a naturopathic physician or pharmacist about 
				how to obtain high-quality supplements. also look for 
				independent, third-party validation of quality. 



be careful of cancer cure claims 
				associated with some dietary supplements. 


the science of herbs and nutrients 
				to prevent and treat cancer is evolving quickly, so be sure to 
				consult someone you trust to develop the safest and most 
				effective supplement program-preferably a naturopathic 
				physician, an integrative health-care doctor or nurse 
				practitioner, or someone on the staff of a clinic or a hospital 
				that consistently uses nutrients and herbs in treatment plans. 
				consult with this person regularly, especially whenever your 
				conventional treatment plan changes, so that you can benefit 
				from the most up-to-date information and receive the best 
				support.
			
oftentimes, people with cancer hope to find a supplement program 
			that's both simple and effective -- just one or two supplements they 
			can add to their treatment plan not only as additional dietary 
			"insurance" but also as complementary therapy. however, because 
			there are so very many different supplements available and, 
			unfortunately, so many different forms of cancer, it's nearly 
			impossible to provide simple recommendations that apply to all forms 
			of cancer. nontheless, there are some shining stars that have been 
			scientifically shown to have anticancer potential and that are also 
			generally considered safe.
			
it can be difficult to get enough nutrients from food due to a 
			variety of reasons, including poor quality of the food as a result 
			of soil depletion, food processing and packaging, or food 
			preparation. even those with relatively healthy diets may be 
			deficient in certain nutrients. this issue is compounded for some 
			people with cancer. as mentioned, cancer commandeers nutrients, 
			leaving healthy tissues depleted. plus, many cancer patients 
			experience loss of appetite or have digestive or absorption issues, 
			especially when undergoing conventional treatments. therefore, a 
			comprehensive multivitamin-multimineral supplement is usually a good 
			idea. in addition, we recommend the following key nutrients: 
			
essential fatty acids reduce inflammation, 
				support apoptosis in cancer cells, help balance hormones, and 
				support antitumor immune activity. the omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil -- eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) and 
				docosahexaenoic acid (dha) -- are especially beneficial. 


green tea interferes with 
				carcinogenesis in multiple places, supports apoptosis in a wide 
				variety of cancer types, exerts antiangiogenic actions, supports 
				detoxification, and has demonstrated anticancer activity in most 
				cancers studied. 


melatonin in high doses (at least 
				20 mg) supports apoptosis of cancer cells, reduces the signals 
				for tumor growth, and improves quality of life during active 
				conventional treatment. 


complementing 
			conventional treatment


			the majority of cancer patients use conventional medicine 
			(surgery, drugs, radiation, or a combination of these) to treat 
			their cancer at some point during their illness. it is vital for 
			these people to realize that conventional medicine and healthy diet, 
			positive lifestyle choices, and dietary supplements are not mutually 
			exclusive (although some care must be taken to ensure that specific 
			supplements aren't contraindicated). in fact, attention to these 
			cornerstones of an integrative approach is absolutely critical 
			before, during, and after conventional treatment. 



it is safe to incorporate the 
				previous diet and lifestyle guidelines with conventional 
				treatments. 


some nutrients and herbs should 
				not be used before surgery, and some should not be used 
				concurrently with some chemotherapy agents or radiation 
				treatments. for safety reasons, it is always best to keep all of 
				your doctors and health-care providers informed about what 
				supplements you're using .  


scientific studies have 
				demonstrated that certain herbs, nutrients, and complementary 
				therapies can help offset side effects of chemotherapy. for 
				instance, l-glutamine can prevent or reduce nerve damage from 
				docetaxel and paclitaxel. coenzyme q10 (coq10) can help protect 
				the heart from damage from doxorubicin. ginger can reduce nausea 
				after surgery. acupuncture can be helpful for nausea or pain 
				relief. mind-body techniques such as mediation, yoga, and guided 
				imagery have also been shown to be effective in helping people 
				cope with cancer, its treatments, and treatment side effects.
				

comprehensive 
			cancer treatments


conventional medicine has made incredible advances in the fight 
			against cancer. however, true and deep healing is only possible with 
			a multifaceted and integrative approach that revolves around the 
			individual needs of the patient. we must find a way to address the 
			whole as we consider the sum of our parts. according to paul reilly, 
			nd, l.ac., of the seattle cancer treatment and wellness center, if 
			we change the internal environment that allowed the cancer to grow, 
			we can change the outcome. we need to tackle cancer using 
			integrative and appropriate body-mind-spirit techniques. an 
			integrative treatment plan requires initiative, cooperation, and 
			commitment from all parties involved and should always be focused on 
			your wellness...


high-fat / low-carb slows brain tumor growth

(rrc -- ri) -- ketocal, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to treat epilepsy in 
		children, can greatly decrease growth of brain tumors in lab animals.
professor tom seyfried, who over saw the study, said, "while the 
		tumors did not vanish in mice who received the strict ketocal diet, they 
		got significantly smaller and the animals lived significantly longer. 
		and compared to radiation, chemotherapy and surgery, ketocal is a 
		relatively inexpensive treatment option."
malignant brain cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and is the 
		second leading cause of cancer death in children. many current 
		treatments target tumor cells while also harming the health and vitality 
		of normal brain cells. the ketocal diet avoids this by starving brain 
		tumor cells of the glucose molecules on which they rely for survival 
		while providing normal brain cells ketones, a class of organic compounds 
		they can metabolize effectively but the tumor cells cannot.
the ketocal diet decreased the growth of brain tumors by between 35 
		percent and 65 percent, researchers reported. moreover, survival rates 
		were higher in the mice on the restricted diet.
the findings were based on a study published this week in the online 
		journal nutrition & metabolism.



pancreatic cancer: capsaicin inhibits 
					tumor growth



		
					(rrc, ri) -- researchers at the university of 
			pittsburgh medical center have discovered an ingredient in red chili 
			pepper, called capsaicin, prevents or slows the growth of pancreatic cancer tumors implanted in lab animals.
			
lead investigator sanjay k. srivastava said,
			"capsaicin fed orally to mice with human pancreatic tumors was 
			an extremely effective inhibitor of the cancer process, inducing 
			apoptosis (cell death). capsaicin triggered  cancerous cells to 
			die off and significantly reduced the size of the tumors."
mice grafted with human pancreatic tumors were fed different 
			amounts of capsaicin for five days per week or three days per week 
			according to their weight, then researchers compared tumor size and 
			levels of apoptotic proteins in the tumors to a control group of 
			mice that received no capsican.
			
mice that ingested capsaicin had increased levels of proteins 
			associated with apoptosis and significantly smaller tumor sizes than 
			the control group. in fact, tumors were half the size of tumors in 
			non-treated mice, the researchers say. 
capsaicin 
			disrupted the mitochondrial function of cancer cells, which resulted 
			in the release of several apoptotic proteins.  the good news 
			is, capsican did not negatively affect normal pancreatic cells.
" our results demonstrate that capsaicin is a potent anticancer 
			agent, induces apoptosis in cancer cells, and produces no 
			significant damage to normal pancreatic cells, indicating its 
			potential use as a novel agent for the prevention and treatment of 
			pancreatic cancer," said srivastava.

gene treatment for chemo-resistant metastatic pancreatic, breast, colon, melanoma cancers


					fda grants "orphan" statusphillipines 
					approve immediate use

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- human clinical 
			results reported in the internt'l journal of oncology reveal 83% of patients with chemo-resistant metastatic 
			pancreatic cancer tumors who received rexin-g, a new gene therapy, showed 
			impressive tumor reduction or tumor death! 
in a second study, 64% tumor 
			response was observed in patients with metastatic breast cancer as 
			well as colon cancer, 
			uterine cancer, muscle and vocal cord cancers, as well as malignant 
			 melanoma.  in a third study, where optimally 
			adjusted doses of rexin-g were administered to three patients, tumor 
			reduction and/or necrosis was achieved in all three patients.
the dramatic functionality of this, the world's first cancer 
			targeted gene delivery system is profound.  the treatment 
			appears to offer broad spectrum activity in many treatment-resistant 
			tumor types, and, equally important, the treatment appears to be 
			exceptionally safe and easily tolerated by patients.
lack of toxicity, dramatic tumor reduction, and the enhanced 
			quality-of-life experienced by patients receiving rexin-g during 
			phase i/ii fda approved trials, constitute meaningful clinical 
			benefits that underscore the need for expediting development and 
			testing of rexin-g for pancreatic cancer patients, and, potentially, 
			for all solid tumor patients.  the fda has already taken note 
			of these first human test results and has moved to speed the process 
			of testing and marketing.
dr. frederick l. hall, president and ceo of epeius 
			biotechnologies, helped develop the remarkable mew treatment said, 
			"whereas logistics had previously stymied delivery of genetic 
			medicine to target lesions (tumors) within the body, intravenous 
			infusions of rexin-g (succeeded and) has stymied intractable cancers 
			without collateral damage to normal organs."
			
the results compiled in these pioneering early  studies, 
			already have convinced the u.s. fda to grant rexin-g "orphan drug" 
			status for treatment of pancreatic cancer, and subsequently, to 
			provide federal support to speed up and continue clinical trials 
			using rexin-g in the united states.  other countires aren't 
			waiting:
based on the dramatic new results, 
			the philippine bureau of food and drugs aren't waiting.  they 
			already have granted rexin-g approval for use in treating all 
			chemo-resistant tumor types in the phillipines.

cancer cure discovered? 
leukocyte infusion 100% effective!now being tried on 
					humans

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- scientists are 
					about to embark on a precedent-setting human trial to 
					determine whether a new cancer treatment called leukocyte infusion therapy (lift) will be as effective in humans as it 
					has proven to be in mice. 
researchers at wake forest university's baptist medical 
					centertransfuse specific white blood cells, called 
					granulocytes, from select donors, into patients with 
					advanced cancers. a treatment using the same type cells from 
					cancer-resistant mice has cured 100 percent of lab mice with 
					advanced malignancies, according to zheng cui, ph.d., lead 
					researcher and associate professor of pathology.
"in 
					mice, we've been able to eradicate even highly aggressive 
					forms of malignancy with extremely large tumors," cui said. 
					"hopefully, we will see the same results in humans. our 
					laboratory studies indicate that this cancer-fighting 
					ability (of granulocytes) is even stronger in healthy 
					humans!"
fda-approved human trails will use white blood 
					cells from healthy young people whose immune systems produce 
					cells with the highest levels of cancer-fighting activity. 
					the anti-tumor response primarily involves granulocytes of 
					the innate human immune system, a system known for its 
					powerful ability to fight off infections.
granulocytes 
					account for up to 60 percent of total white blood cells in 
					healthy humans, researchers say, and people can donate 
					granulocytes through a process called apheresis. it 
					separates granulocytes and returns other blood components 
					back to donors, whose systems quickly remanufacture 
					replacement granulocytes.
for the study, 500 potential 
					local donors are being recruited who are 50 years old or 
					younger and in good health. the 100 donors with the highest 
					cancer-killing activity in their cells will be asked to 
					donate white blood cells for the study. twenty-two cancer 
					patients with solid tumors that don't respond to 
					conventional therapies will receive the donated cells.

skin cancer cured in patients by genetic 
					material from another patient who beat it

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- immune cells in some 
					cancer patient recognize, attack, and kill cancer cells, 
					leading to full patient recovery.     
					recently steven rosenberg at the national cancer institute 
					isolated these cancer kiling t cells (tumor-infiltrating 
					lymphocytes) in a patient who had successfully beaten 
					melanoma.  he then  introduced genetic information 
					from them via a harmless retrovirus into the t cells of 
					patients suffering from active cases of potentially deadly 
					melanoma.
					     the result?  one month 
					after treatment the new killer t cells made up between 9 and 
					56 percent of the t cell population in 15 of 17 patients 
					treated!     better yet, 18 months 
					after treatment, 2 of the 17 cured themselves of skin-cancer 
					and continued to show high levels of the cancer killing 
					cells in their systems. 
					 


new treatment destroys
					cancer cells & tumors

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- scientists at katholieke 
					universiteit leuven in belgium, in collaboration with the 
					flemish biotech company, thrombo-genics, report the 
					anti-cancer agent "anti-plgf" not only treats 
					tumors for which other therapies fail, but also enhances 
					effectiveness of existing forms of chemotherapy -- all without side 
					effects!  the findings were published in the 
					prestigious medical journal, cell.
how it works
all living tissue is supplied with oxygen 
					and nutrients via blood vessels. but tumors grow much more 
					quickly than normal tissue and have greater need for 
					nutrients. this causes tumor cells 
					produce growth factors that stimulate formation of 
					additional blood vessels (called angiogenesis) to feed the 
					tumor.
when formation of blood vessels that feed 
					tumor cells is blocked, the tumor starves to death due to 
					the lack of oxygen and nutrients.  existing 
					anti-angiogenesis drugs eliminate the most common 
					angiogenesis growth factor but cause serious side effects.  
					in addition the cancer compensates by producing other growth 
					factors, so that the drugs lose their effect.
for several years now, researchers have 
					been experimenting with a new angiogenetic growth factor: 
					the placental growth factor, or plgf. plgf only stimulates 
					blood vessel formation in cancer and other diseases. 

researcher christian fischer and his 
					colleagues − under the direction of peter carmeliet and in 
					close collaboration with the biotech company thrombogenics 
					directed by désiré collen − have been studying the 
					therapeutic possibilities of anti-plgf, which retards the 
					action of plgf. anti-plgf not only increases the 
					effectiveness of chemotherapy and the current 
					anti-angiogenesis therapy, but  also inhibits growth 
					and metastasis of tumors resistant to existing drugs. in 
					contrast to current therapies, anti-plgf does not trigger a 
					rescue operation in which other growth factors are 
					produced as compensation.
what's next?
favorable evaluation of anti-plgf as a 
					potential cancer treatment raises hope for a more effective 
					cancer therapy with fewer side effects − which can be used 
					with children and pregnant women, too.  first clinical 
					tests of the new treatment are expected to begin shortly.

new lymphoma treatment
					delivers 8+ yr survival ratebut patients 
					are not getting it!

 

(robertsreview, ri, usa) --  researchers 
					say r 
					9 of 10 cancer patients given a relatively new combinative 
					radiation/cancer-killing antibodies treatment are still 
					alive eight years later. 


 

half with previously untreated follicular 
					lymphoma suffered no relapses after 
					treatment.  follicular lymphoma (a cancer of the lymph 
					tissue, an important part of the immune system.) is a common 
					form of non-hodgkin's lymphoma accounting for about 15% of 
					cases.

 

treatment stimulates the body's immune system 
					to kill cancer by combining the antibody (tositumomab) with 
					radioactive iodine  administered through infusion.

 

the advantage is that bexxar (the treatment) 
					is given in one week, with very little toxicity, says mark 
					kaminski, md, professor of internal medicine at the 
					university of michigan comprehensive cancer center in ann 
					arbor.

 

traditional chemotherapy requires several 
					months of therapy and is associated with a variety of 
					toxicities and side effects which can include nausea, hair 
					loss, and infections.

86% still alive at 8 years

 

this is the first study to use bexxar in 
					untreated patients.  (fda approved bexxar in 
					2003 for treatment only  of follicular non-hodgkin's 
					lymphoma in patients non-responsive to therapy with rituxan who relapsed following chemotherapy.)
					


 

seventy-six people with advanced follicular 
					lymphoma (stage iii & iv) who had not yet been 
					treated for their disease participated in the eight year 
					study.  results showed 95% responded positively.  75% 
					had a complete disappearance of any sign of cancer.  overall 
					survival was 86%. fifty percent (50%) continued to show no 
					signs of cancer. of the 57 patients who had complete 
					remission, two-thirds remained in remission.

 

when injected, bexxar acts like a homing 
					missile, traveling through the bloodstream it zeroes in on a 
					protein "target" found on the surface of cancer cells. its 
					radiation kills these cells while generally sparing healthy 
					ones.why are 90% of patients 
					not 
getting this treatment?
fewer than 10% of patients 
					who could benefit are getting it, according to dr. 
					kaminski.
why?   most are initially seen by 
					so-called "medical oncologists" who can easily deliver 
					chemotherapy right in their offices. bexxar treatment, 
					however, requires coordination between the medical 
					oncologist, the radiation oncologist, the radiopharmacy, and 
					others.

bottom line:  if patients want this 
					highle-effective treatment, they first must know about its 
					existence...and then they have to demand it from their 
					doctors who, more often than not...take the "easier, faster, 
					more profitable approach" to treating the patient.
 

chemo combo extends 
			asbestos related 
			cancer patient survival

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- mesothelioma 
			attacks the lungs, heart and abdomen and is associated with exposure 
			to asbestors. although there is no known cure, a new study shows 
			patients given pemetrexed and cisplatin -- along with the vitamin 
			supplements folic acid and b12 live longer...and better..
			
researchers led by john green, m.d., at the clatterbridge center 
			for oncology in england, studied 448 patients and reported that, "pemetrexed 
			used in combination with cisplatin significantly increases the 
			length of survival, compared with cisplatin alone."
patients receiving the combo survived nearly three months longer 
			than patients getting cisplatin alone and reported improved quality 
			of life in terms of fatigue, loss of appetite, pain and cough. 
			during early stages of the trial, however, some patients receiving 
			pemetrexed had serious symptoms of toxicity, including drug-related 
			death. other side effects included blood cell abnormalities, nausea 
			and diarrhea. these decreased in both frequency and severity after 
			vitamins were added to the treatment.

drug improves 
			advanced colorectal cancer survival

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- an effective 
			treatment option for colorectal cancer patients for whom other 
			treatment options have been exhausted  cetuximab  was revealed in 
			research presented at the ri annual meeting of the american 
			association for cancer.
cetuximab, marketed as erbitux improved survival rates and slowed progression of the disease, according to a study 
			of 572 colorectal cancer patients conducted by researchers in 
			canada, australia, new zealand and singapore.
derek jonker, m.d., assistant professor at the university of 
			ottawa and study co-chair reported, "this is the first time a single 
			agent biologically targeted therapy has demonstrated a survival 
			advantage in patients with colorectal cancer, and it is also the 
			first time an egfr-targeting drug has achieved this goal."
the study, called co.17, was a randomized, multi-center, phase 
			iii trial. it compared cetuximab plus best supportive care to best 
			supportive care alone in patients whose metastatic colorectal cancer 
			was no longer responding to all available chemotherapy, including 
			irinotecan, oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidines.
			
patients who received cetuximab were given 400 mg intravenously 
			at the outset, followed by weekly doses of 250 mg.
			
cetuximab, an antibody against the epidermal growth factor 
			receptor (egfr), binds to the receptor on the surface of cancer 
			cells, preventing activation of enzymatic pathways that lead to cell 
			growth and proliferation. cetuximab also enlists the body's immune 
			system by triggering "natural killer cells" to attack the cancer, a 
			process called antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity.
jonker says the co.17 trial showed a 23 percent improvement in 
			overall survival and a 32 percent reduction in the risk of disease 
			progression. the survival time of the participants was, on average, 
			six months for the patients given cetuximab versus four-and-a-half 
			months for patients who received best supportive care alone.
"earlier studies demonstrated cetuximab could shrink colon 
			tumors, both alone and when combined with chemotherapy," jonker 
			said. "while some patients receiving cetuximab in the co.17 study 
			had significant tumor shrinkage, many more had the cancer growth 
			arrested, delaying progress of the disease and resulting in patients 
			living longer."
					 


experts clash on efficacy of new brain cancer 
					treatment


(robertsreview, ri, usa)
		
					children with high-risk medulloblastoma have had only a 30-40 percent chance of 
					surviving to five years. now, however, a new experimental 
					treatment that relies on a child's own stem cells 
					dramatically improves the odds.
"we can now cure 70 percent of children with 
					high-risk medulloblastoma and more than 80 percent of those 
					with standard-risk disease with a much shorter chemotherapy 
					approach," said lead researcher dr. amar gajjar, from st 
					jude's children's research hospital in memphis, tn.
in sept. 7 online edition of medical journal the 
					lancet oncology doctors described the new treatment in 
					which radiation therapy is tailored to fit the severity of 
					the brain cancer. it is then followed by a dramatically reduced 
					course of chemo. to accomplish the reduction researchers 
					took stem cells from patients before chemotherapy and 
					implanted them after each round of chemo.  researchers 
					report that this allows the chid's body to recover from the 
					extensive damage caused by chemo.
use of (chemotherapy drug) cisplatin was reduced from 
					eight doses to four doses, and the amount of vincristine 
					from 32 doses to just eight!  this alleviated much of 
					the neurotoxicity associated with the normal chemo dosages.
gujjar says, "investigators should consider adopting a 
					similar therapeutic strategy for high-risk patients. this 
					approach should be feasible in most pediatric oncology units 
					at academic medical centers, but meticulous staging and 
					careful attention to detail during radiotherapy planning and 
					treatment are essential to obtain similar results."
but dr. anna j. janss, co-director of the neuro-oncology 
					program at the aflac cancer center of children's healthcare 
					of atlanta -- said the findings won't change her approach to 
					treating childhood brain cancer.
					
dr janss says the results don't make her say: "oh, i 
					want to treat all my patients this way." she said the new 
					approach is only as good as what has been done before, but 
					not good enough to make her harvest stem cells from every 
					child she treats.

vaccines reversing


		
			melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, pancreatic, prostate cancer

(robertsreview, ri, usa) -- when 
			retired surgeon, dr. eugene overton, 74, was diagnosed with 
			melanoma, instead of chemotherapy, which causes devastating side 
			effects, he chose an immune system "booster shot" to fight the often 
			deadly cancer..
he receives injections every three weeks that signal the his 
			immune system to attack malignant cells, much as the body does with 
			viruses and bacteria...only this time the target is cancer cells. 
			and it is working!
overton boasts he's not only had no recurrence of melanoma, but 
			also no side-effects from the treatment. this is because 
			immunotherapy doesn't damage healthy tissue the way chemotherapy and 
			radiation do..
			
about 160 immunotherapy approved "trials" are under way in the 
			u.s., some are on the verging of going for fda approval. leading the 
			way is the university of texas m.d. anderson cancer center, which 
			three years ago opened a state-of-the-art immunology research 
			center.
high-profile success is keeping an m.d. anderson doctor 
			healthy and thriving nearly 15 months after diagnosis with glioblastoma, a 
					brain cancer he treats that typically kills 
			its victims well within that time.
even though prostate and brain cancers are being treated 
			successfully with the approach, the greatest promise involves blood 
			and microscopic cancers.
"it's the first time i've seen usually jaded oncologists excited 
			about the prospects with immunotherapy," dr. amy heimberger, an m.d. 
			anderson neurosurgeon says. "suddenly, senior doctors who once 
			pooh-poohed immunotherapy are referring patients to junior 
			researchers in the field."
oddly, the treatment dates back to 1891 when new york doctor 
			william coley inoculated cancer patients with live streptococcal 
			cultures and some experienced remissions.the shot fell by the 
			wayside due to inconsistent results and the growing dominance of 
			surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
now, however, researchers have identified "markers" unique to 
			cancer cells that the immune system can be trained to target. 
			they've also discovered naturally occurring, immune system-boosting 
			compounds that can be produced in labs. the result is a new, one-two 
			punch of drugs that energize the immune system and direct it to go 
			after specific cancer cells that it had hardly noticed before.
dr. jeff molldrem, an m.d. anderson professor of blood and 
			marrow transplantation says, "it's like suddenly having the cancer's 
			postal address and being able to activate the immune system to 
			deliver its blow there."
an m.d. anderson treatment produced complete responses in a 
					clinical trial for patients with acute leukemia for which no 
					other intervention had been successful. another showed
					glioblastoma patients survived 
					much longer than those 
			treated with chemo and radiation...and with fewer side effects. the 
					mary crowley medical research center in dallas produced 
					responses  sometimes years-long remission  in half of 
					trial participants with a lung cancer that typically kills 
					in four to six months. at the national cancer institute, a 
					mix of cancer-specific t cells and a booster produced 
					radical 
			improvement in patients with advanced melanoma.
johns hopkins is working on pancreatic cancer, which kills 
			31,000 americans annually. to battle it, jh researchers are 
			supplementing surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation with a new 
			vaccine that uses stunted cancer cells that emit a molecule called 
			gm-csf. it attracts cells that still have immunity to the tumor and 
			causes these cells to come in contact with antigens from cells that 
			have been exposed to radiation. these same cells then travel around 
			the body and annihilate other cancer cells.
			
patients receive the vaccination eight to 10 weeks after surgery 
			and again after chemotherapy and radiation. two years into the 
			study, results are optimistic: survival rates for the 60 patients in 
			the study are reported to be 88 percent after one year and 76 
			percent after two years for the rapidly deadly form of cancer, which 
			is the fourth leading cause of u.s. death.
dr. daniel laheru, who heads the study, says the only known cure 
			for pancreatic cancer is surgical removal of the cancer. the 
			setback, he explains, is that only 15 to 20 of every 100 patients 
			can have the surgery because this type of cancer is often not 
			detected early enough. survival rates, especially in the long-term, 
			were grim under traditional approaches...until now.
immunotherapy sometimes works even better when 
			combined with chemotherapy or radiation, which suppress the immune 
			system! an m.d. anderson study found immunotherapy helped fight an 
					aggressive lymphoma, even 
			though prior chemotherapy obliterated all the b cells thought 
			necessary to mount an immune defense!
			
nevertheless, lack of randomized trials in support of 
			the therapy continues to exist. nevertheless researchers say the 
			greatest strides are being made against cancers where the immune 
			system can fight them in manageable stages, such as in the blood or 
			lymph nodes or in early diagnosis. late stage tumors, they say, can 
			be attacked, too, but winning the battle against them is more 
			difficult.

57% 
	of lung cancer patients survive 2 years longer with thermal ablation 
(rrc, ri) -- 
according to 
	research in the july issue of the journal of vascular and interventional 
	radiology, utilizing imaging and targeted thermal ablation, can heat and 
	destroy lung tumors, and significantly extend a patients life.
	
to do it, interventional radiologists insert a probe into the tumor. 
	energy is then transmitted to the tip of the needle to either "cook" or 
	"freeze" the tumor, killing it, says study author damian dupuy, m.d. of 
	rhode island hospital, in providence.
only one-third of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer 
	are eligible for surgery  the rest face the reality of having less than 12 
	months to live," says dupuy.   these new outpatient treatments 
	not only are effective, but allow us to treat patients who historically have 
	no other options.
tumors need a blood supply, which they actively generate to feed 
	themselves and grow. interventional radiologists can attack the cancer and 
	destroy the supply and the tumor from inside the body without medicating or 
	affecting other parts of the body. these minimally-invasive treatments are 
	much easier on the patient than chemo or radiation therapy. thermal ablation 
	can be given without affecting the patients overall health and most people 
	can resume their usual activities in a few days. the treatment usually does 
	not require general anesthesia and is typically performed on an outpatient 
	basis. 
	
radio frequency ablation (rfa) kills the tumor cells with heat, while 
	sparing healthy lung tissue. depending on the size of the tumor, rfa can 
	shrink or kill the tumor, extending the patients survival time and greatly 
	improving their quality of life while living with cancer.
microwave ablation utilizes electromagnetic microwaves to agitate the 
	water molecules in the tumor and surrounding tissue, ultimately reversing 
	the cells polarity. this causes friction and heat which kills the cell 
	(coagulation necrosis).

vitamin 
					cuts risk of pancreatic cancer 


			(rrc, ri)  northwestern university 
			and harvard medical researchers have discovered that taking the recommended us 
			dose of ten microgrammes a day of vitamin d almost halves the risk 
			of pancreatic cancer. results of their survey of 46,711 men and 
			75,427 women are published in the september issue of cancer 
			epidemiology biomarkers & prevention. they show that simply taking 
			the minimum u.s. daily allowance of vitamin d reduces the risk of 
			pancreatic cancer by 43%
those who consumed less than four microgrammes had a 22 per cent 
			lower risk, according to an analysis of the health of more than 
			120,000 people.
vitamin d is present in foods such as oily fish, liver and eggs 
			and is also produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. more 
			research is needed to determine if vitamin d from dietary 
			sources...or...the sun may be preferable to supplements.
dr halcyon skinner, of northwestern university, who carried out 
			the study with harvard, also said: "vitamin d has shown strong 
			potential for preventing and treating prostate cancer, and areas 
			with greater sunlight exposure have lower incidence and mortality 
			for prostate, breast and colon cancers, leading us to investigate a 
			role for vitamin d in pancreatic cancer risk. few studies have 
			examined this association, and we did observe a reduced risk for 
			pancreatic cancer with higher intake of vitamin d."
			
there is no known cure for pancreatic cancer and surgical 
			treatments are not often effective. apart from cigarette smoking, no 
			environmental factors or dietary practices have been linked to the 
			disease.

studies show cell phonesdo cause cancer

		
					other serious illnesses also suspected
(rrc, ri) --  the cell 
			phone cancer connection has been hotly debated for years, but now experts 
			warn mobile phones do, in fact, increase brain cancer, 
			parkinsons, memory loss, alzheimers, acoustic neuromas, vision 
			impairment, hypertension, and, perhaps, other health problems.
			
global research now proves beyond doubt that continuous exposure 
			to cellphone radiation can lead to many harmful effects according to 
			dr s. pattnaik, head and professor of the etv centre, 
			electronics and communication engineering, national institute of 
			technical teachers training & research (nitttr), chandigar, 
			india.
			
one study includes a three-year $27 million research program headed by george carlo, a public health researcher, who now 
			says radio frequency radiation from cell phone antennae appears to 
			cause genetic damage in human blood.
			
dr. pattnaik says his research shows that children are even more 
			vulnerable than adults to mobile phone radiation and that damage 
			varies in correlation with head size, age, duration of exposure, 
			distance of antenna from the body and the users posture at the time 
			of phone use.
dr. pattnaik warns cell phone buyers to carefully assess the 
			specific absorption rate (sar) when buying. the u.s. 
			fcc sar limit for the head is 1.6 watt per kg of body tissue. he 
			advises: buy a mobile phone with as low an sar rating as 
			possible.
			
dos and donts* buy cell phones with low sar values.* 
			use landline when possible.* frequent users should use 
			earphones.* use phones which keep antennas farthest from the 
			body.* keep phones away from body as far as possible.* limit 
			children's use of cell phones* do not keep cell phones in shirt 
			pockets as they may also interfere with heart function.
 


new cervical cancer treatment extends lives
(rrc - ri) --  combining glaxo's drug,
hycamtin, with other drugs better treats severe 
cervical cancer when surgery or radiation may no longer work, according to the 
fda.
when used with the chemotherapy agent cisplatin, hycamtin patients lived 
more than three months longer than those receiving traditional treatments, according to the fda. both drugs are already used to 
treat other cancers, including ovarian and lung and the newly approved 
combination only should be used, the fda says, after other options are ruled out 
when the disease is incurable, recurrent or has spread to other organs.
hycamtin itself, however, can harm the immune system, lower white blood cell 
counts crucial to fighting infection, and spawn a range of other side effects 
including decreasing blood platelets, which can lead to excessive bleeding and 
anemia.
nevertheless, fda acting commissioner andrew von eschenbach says, "this course 
of drug therapy is a potentially life-prolonging option for thousands of women."
