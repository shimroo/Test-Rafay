the ataturk society of america (asa) enthusiastically supports the sustainable development goals of the united nations, especiallygoal #4 "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"


since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. the total enrolment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half. there has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before. these are all remarkable successes. but despite progress, the world failed to meet the millennium development goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. the sustainable development goals clearly recognize that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly addresses the challenges of quality and equity. achieving inclusive and equitable quality education for all will require increasing efforts, especially in sub-saharan africa and southern asia and for vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, indigenous people, refugee children and poor children in rural areas.


goal #5 "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls"


gender inequalities are still deeply rooted in every society. many women still lack access to employment opportunities, basic education, and healthcare, and they’re often subjected to violence and discrimination. the math is simple: in countries where there’s higher equality, there’s less poverty, more economic growth, and a higher standard of living. let’s improve opportunities for everyone by dismantling barriers to women’s participation in economic, social and political life.


goal #16 "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels"


we can only look forward to a more equal and sustainable world if we have more peaceful and inclusive societies. that means we’ll need to reduce crime, violence, and exploitation. the illegal arms and drug trade will have to stop. public institutions that we all rely on will have to be effective, transparent and accountable.

“atatürk’s thought”: a political theory of progress and peace


the atatürk society of america adds a publication to the vast literature on atatürk. the book, “atatürk’s thought”: a political theory of progress and peace, authored by the society’s former president metin camcigil has been launched on the occasion of the annual atatürk commemoration day event of november 10, 2020.
the book, unlike most publications regarding of all things atatürk, studies his thought system as going beyond the circumstances of its time to constitute a political science theory for good state governance. the author’s view is that atatürk’s thought system may be summarized as being governance with rationality, dynamism to conform to social changes, recognition of a high status for women in society, and an education policy that embraces progress and peace for the entire humanity. it is the author’s and the atatürk society of america’s hope that this publication will initiate a well-deserved but long missing discourse in political science.
