welcome to my creative journey! all of the musical instruments shown here have been professionally hand-built and designed by me. my mbiras, and other percussion instruments, are used by professional studio and touring musicians, in schools, by storytellers, by music and sound therapy practitioners, art collectors, gourd enthusiasts, and by people from all walks of life who enjoy the beautiful, relaxing qualities of their sounds.
