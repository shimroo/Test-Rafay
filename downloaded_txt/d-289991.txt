welcome to film-friendly monterey county
there’s a great history of filmmaking in monterey county, and a wealth of film locations for features, commercials, tv, and other media productions. the monterey county film commission is a nonprofit organization, which promotes our area’s locations, crew and businesses to the film industry, making it easy for filmmakers to take their projects from start to finish here. nearly $136 million has come into local communities from film production since the film commission was created by the monterey county board of supervisors in 1987.
