what our members say







donna coxi can truthfully say i wouldn’t be the owner of a successful business without the support and opportunities i’ve received from corridor nine. i have been a member of the chamber for 25+ years, when my husband and i started our first business.  we became ambassadors, members of the board, and i joined the school/business partnership committee (sbpc), which became a passion.  i never imagined then that one day, i would be the long-time chair of the sbpc and would have served a term as the chair of the board of directors.  i have made valuable business contacts as a result of my chamber membership, but even more importantly, since i joined the chamber, i’ve done business with friends: my personal and business lawyers, my banker, my accountant, even my vet are all friends from the chamber.  when i joined, the last thing that you would ever have found me doing was speaking in front of a group.  because of the opportunities i’ve been given to develop personally and professionally as a business leader at the chamber, i speak regularly in front of hundreds of chamber members at events.

david bagdonhaving been a member of corridor nine for well over 20 years, i can say without hesitation that it has been the most valuable business association i have ever been involved with. my involvement has exposed me to literally hundreds of new and potential customers.  although i’m certain my involvement has caused a significant jump in my business… i’m just as pleased to say it has also rewarded me with a long list of new connections and some very special friends.  i can say from experience that those who are willing to invest their time and effort in corridor nine will find rewards that pay them back many times over.

ryan fitzgeraldas a new chamber member, i wasn’t sure what to expect.  it was such a nice surprise to receive an inbound call from a chamber member that she heard about us through the corridor nine chamber of commerce.  everyone i have met has been extremely helpful and welcoming. i look forward to getting to know more chamber members and really appreciate the referral.

dawne dragonettii would like to thank corridor nine for doing such a fabulous job running such an amazing organization. every time bbbs staff members have been to a corridor nine event there we have met amazing people and have formed some great relationships. usually whenever anyone sees bbbs coming at them they get nervous and you can see them thinking – oh boy! what do they want. not at corridor nine – especially the bff group! everyone knows the important work we do and will bend over backwards to help us out. thank you!!!!

jennifer richtsmeierit is an overwhelmingly gratifying experience to be amongst 100+ talented and brilliant women from the community each and every month as we support and learn from one another at business forward females (bff) luncheons.  i feel so empowered by the amazing speakers and the women in the room.  now that i have been to 4 or more bff events, this has become my favorite day of the month!

sandy pochapinrenewal by andersen was a first time exhibitor at the corridor nine business expo and signed up last minute to boot! it was a great event for us, the expo was well attended, the attendees were qualified and relaxed – and our 4 hours there resulted in a $23.5k sale!  we will definitely be back next year.

kate mcevoy-zdonczykas a health care services company, harvard pilgrim health care works with many chambers of commerce across the new england states, and the corridor nine chamber of commerce is definitely one of the best.  their programs are both relevant and substantive which makes for a packed room at any corridor nine forum.  as a team, they are masters of mass communication and (best of all) they are a pleasure to work with.  i marvel at their ability to effectively connect with and support so many different constituencies – from ceo’s to those just entering the work force….no one does it better than corridor nine!

emily m. cabrerabeing a member of corridor nine impacts our business and our community nearly every day. being active is key. one of the first things i learned was “don’t think about what the chamber can do for you, think about what you can do for the chamber.” and it’s true! i joined the young professional group, hype9, and my first event was pulling weeds with a group at the community harvest project (how would that possibly impact our business?). i met a few new people, not thinking that anything would come from it. a few weeks later, a gentleman i met called me with a lead for a holiday gift card sale. that sale resulted in over $3,000; just because i met him at this event (pulling weeds!). i’ve also realized, it’s quality over quantity. building more meaningful relationships one-on-one is much for useful than trying to collect the most business cards. every meeting i go to, someone tells me that they have recently visited the restaurant, and that’s amazing!

dr. joseph sawyercorridor nine’s school/business partnership committee is a stellar example of collaboration between the local business community and local schools.  schools in the corridor nine region benefit from the mini-grant program that provides funds that turn educators’ innovative ideas into reality, while high-achieving graduating high school students benefit from valuable financial assistance through the corridor nine scholarship program.  perhaps more importantly, the school/business partnership connects business and school leaders so that they may learn from each other about key topics and collaborate to support the critically important work of educating the next generation.

james p. desrosierswhat am i most thankful for in 2014? joining the corridor nine area chamber of commerce. in addition to meeting a group of business people who are professional, committed, helpful, and fun…my training and coaching company engaged with six new clients, resulting in growthco’s best revenue date so far! and 2015 is showing to already have 65% of our sales goal booked. again, thank you so much!!!!!!

kevin russelli’d like to take a moment and thank the corridor nine chamber of commerce for being top notch organization. i’ve had the privilege of working with several chambers in multiple states and can assure you that corridor nine is in a league of its own. the thorough communication we receive; the support; the constant hosting of events for businesses to showcase their offerings, and their leadership, are value-added for any business. we’re happy and proud to be associated with the corridor nine chamber of commerce.
