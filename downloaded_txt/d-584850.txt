home school mom getting homeschooled





i am in a season of re-education.  god is showing me how he wants me at his feet listening and learning and not finding my security in the world's system for education.  it is not an easy road but yet it is one that has been in the back of my head for several years.i have been re-reading some books by marilyn howshall and this time i was really ready to hear.  the biggest thing i gleaned through her writings as well as my time with the lord is that i must learn to listen and follow him whether anyone else agrees or not.  he does not ask me to do what i shouldn't or what would be detrimental for my kids.  in fact, he actually knows what is best.it sounds so silly but it is so profound if i can embrace it.  i asked him to show me my schedule for the year and he refused.  i asked and begged for it but he shared with me that it would become my god.  that i would be frustrated and stressed if i didn't reach that schedule and i would feel failure. i would miss the point of listening and trusting him daily and in turn teaching my kids to do the same.wow.  this is such a trusting process.  now he has allowed me to get some ideas for routines but being sure that i understand the routine may change anytime he deems it and some interuptions will be his leading.dying to self is not easy, but necessary and in the end....freedom.

rebellion/re-education





well, this past week i had some interactions with family and i can't believe how quickly i can be like a 2 year old.  i do not, as a full fledged adult, want to be told what to do!  i would rather resist than lovingly embrace a bossy instruction.i am wrestling with letting go of my rights but also not letting others get away with their selfishness.  however, if i was not being selfish myself, their selfishness probably wouldn't bother me so much! lthe lord has been dealing with me on my little tudes and how they also affect my family and get planted in them as well.  my kids are watching and learning and ick, this is not the way i want them to be.i have been re-reading some of my articles from marilyn howshall.  can i just say that i am truly hit to the heart.i realize that i act in the flesh way to much including my parenting. she does such a good job of sweetly saying things that just hit hard...in a good way.i hate that i react in my flesh with my kids and i don't like knowing that it is producing the same in them when i do that.however, i am excited and encouraged to enter into a phase of god squeezing and working in my life to flush out that big fleshy side.  he is so gracious to be patient and continue to teach me!

happy 4th!  injury





we enjoyed a great week with my sister and her kiddos only i didn't get any pics to show of it! that is awful. however, we had fun reading at library, eating out bagels at panera, swimming, creating at home...journals, talking, playing etc! we so loved having them but it went to fast.last night we had a wonderful time with our marshall family and friends! marme & papaw, susan & kendyal and kids, friends k,r & h, and us. :)funny story we'll remember: okay so last night we eat burgers, hot dogs and such (many desserts) and begin to head to fireworks display.well.....it was a whole hour late and we had arrived 30mins. early. there was a storm brewing so it was lightning before and during the fireworks. the kids were playing and goofing and we had some sparklers. one of the head of the sparklers fell off and landed on my toe. i felt a shart burning sensation, screamed and jumped and sure enough there was literally fire on the ground! my toe and flip flop were scorched a bit. however, marme had some ice so i was able to put it on quickly. injury from sparkler....who'd a thought? lit is fine though.then, we were chanting for fireworks and just about to give up with off they went. we all cheered so loud! they were gorgeous!!! dripcheers for more beautiful fireworksdripswoosh--bottom fell out and we all run with stuff to the cars pretty much drenched.it is one of those times we know we will talk about forever.we promptly rushed 2 inches in the truck and slowly inched our way out of the area (3 miles) in 45minutes. i think we will ask the neighbors how good the view was from our street and if it was good, we may make our memories here in our yard. or just bring our table, drinks and tent for next year.well, here's hoping to a great 4th for you!!
