unite & strengthenjewish congregations that honor yeshua the messiah of israel









 











continued prayer and intercession for israel  tzur yisrael, rock of israel, arise to the help of israel, and deliver as you promised judah and israel.for all the remaining hostages to be set free, speedily and soon.from heaven adonai gazes on the earth,to hear the groaning of the prisoner,to set free those condemned to death,to declare the name of adonai in zionand his praise in jerusalem. (psalm 102:20-22 tlv)for wisdom and divine guidance for israel's military and political leaders. for the complete collapse of hamas and hezbollah. for many within their ranks to see the futility and wickedness of their hatred of israel and the jewish people, turn away from it, and drop their arms.for mercy and minimal harm upon civilians on all sides, and for a growing awareness and turning toward the one true god among them all.for the children of gaza and the palestinian territories to be freed from the indoctrination toward hatred in their schools. for seeds of understanding and peace to be sown among both the arab and israeli populations.against the rising tide of antisemitism around the world. against the flood of misinformation and slander coming at israel and the jewish people, and against the demonic forces of anti-jewish hatred. arise, adonai! may your enemies be scattered!may those who hate you flee from before you! (num 10:35)in addition to prayer, you can also support israel through the umjc israel aid fund, which has raised nearly $250,000 to distribute directly to messianic jewish war relief efforts in israel.

how to have peace with the in-laws



feb 13, 2025




much of the biblical text recounts pitfalls and bad relationships that serve as examples of what not to do. this week's portion gives us a welcome respite from that trend in showcasing the relationship between moses and his father-in-law, jethro.

being god's “hope dealers”



feb 6, 2025




this week’s parasha, beshalach, is one of the most dramatic and inspiring portions in the torah. it tells of israel’s miraculous deliverance at the red sea — a moment when all seemed lost, and yet, through divine intervention, salvation came.

reading renewal forward



jan 28, 2025




let’s talk about renewal. there’s something powerful about starting fresh—about moving forward, not just physically, but spiritually. it’s about embracing change and becoming more of who we’re meant to be as israel, the people of the god of israel.

i have put my words in your mouth



jan 23, 2025




moses knew the heart of pharaoh and doubted the success of god’s plan (6:12), but god had commanded him to speak these words; god had put these words in his mouth: “let my people go  that they may serve me.”

how are you wired?



jan 15, 2025




 how are you wired? what makes you tick? god creates and redeems us to be lights in the world, lights of different kinds. some of us will be lights of creativity. some, lights of justice and truth. some of us are lights of compassionate action. some are lights of supernatural power. whatever the case, god wants us to be lights in the world.

the never-ending story  



jan 9, 2025




this week, as we are reading parashat vayechi (“and he lived”), the united states is remembering president jimmy carter, who passed away on december 29. in israel, the country mourns hostage youssef al-zidayne, whose body was discovered in a gaza tunnel on january 8, along with evidence that his son hamza was also dead.

and then i saw his face



dec 31, 2024




when i was in 8th grade, the monkees first appeared on television. they had recorded a hit song called “i’m a believer.” the lyrics proclaim, “and then i saw her face; now i’m a believer!” this week, we see a similar change in the story of joseph when his brothers saw his face.

unity: the ultimate miracle



dec 25, 2024




yeshua is the light that dispels the darkness, the one who brings peace and unity. during this season, as we commemorate the great miracles that god has brought, let’s remember in unity the light that he brings into our midst, and among our brethren.

we only know that he is with us



dec 17, 2024




with this week’s parasha the great saga of genesis takes a decisive turn. the dramatic visitations of god that characterized the lives of abraham, isaac, and jacob come to an end. in the following story of joseph and his brothers, we might be tempted to ask where god is amidst all that they have to go through.

"i have plenty!"

gratitude is a powerful antidote to the virus of gloom and anxiety that afflicts us today, and it shows up in a surprising way in this week’s torah reading when esau, of all people, models it for us.

february executive director address



feb 4, 2025




greetings union friends,my wife barri and i recently returned from our winter leadership conference in san diego, california. our president, rabbi barney kasdan (with liz kasdan), hosted a great conference. we were pleased to connect with old friends and excited about all the new ones, too.one of those new friends was a videographer named todd morehead. he showcased his new video entitled, “hope in the holy land”…

january executive director letter 



jan 12, 2025




greetings union friends, in 1899, charles holland duel, commissioner of the us patent office, (supposedly) said: “everything that can be invented has been invented.” i was shocked that someone in his position could say such a thing, so i was pleased to learn later he was misquoted. believing as i do that the future belongs to those who dream and strive, accepting the status quo doesn’t abide with me. for me, it’s all about forward!

november executive director address



oct 29, 2024




greetings union friends,i recently passed the one-year marker as the union’s executive director. upon this first anniversary, i was asked what it was like leading the union of messianic jewish congregations in the first year. though well-intended, i thought it was a poor question for a few reasons—not least of which being that i am not the leader.the union is delegate-led. delegates outline policies that are managed by the executive committee, which the executive director is a part of. the executive director works with the executive committee, under the president, at the behest of the delegates. in theory and in practice we all work for you.

sep 9, 2024




greetings umjc friends:there’s so much happening in the union, i’m prompted to think people would be better served by a newspaper than a letter—but a letter it is, with a video.i am sure that first and foremost on our hearts is our beloved israel. we are all heartbroken over the recent recovery of six more murdered hostages, and continue to pray for true peace to be reached very soon for the sake of all those impacted. thank you for your practical support these many months.

august executive director address



jul 31, 2024




this year’s spectacular summer conference is behind us—and what a conference it was. unfortunately for me, i was holed up in the hotel with covid—an affliction that raised its head, spread rapidly, and impacted others. i’m sorry i missed so much of it. rabbi jude caracelo reported that we needed to bring out extra chairs to accommodate the crowd on saturday morning. i loved hearing that and am sure others were pleased to see it.this year’s conference saw a 25% increase over the previous year’s. the uptick follows a trend.

i write to you from england, where i am slaving away with further studies. my attention is simultaneously state-side, as foremost in my thinking, labors, and prayers is the upcoming union summer family conference next month.we're so looking forward gathering as a community; seeing old friends and making new connections, hearing from our many gifted teachers, and enjoying downtime together.

june executive director address



jul 31, 2024




i just returned from israel with my wife, barri. we went to provide aid and share joy. despite the mood there, we did our best to stay upbeat. at times though, barri couldn’t help but be a bit “catty” (see the photo taken in an israeli hospital’s underground emergency room).we all know we are living in a rather upside-down world, evidenced, in part, by the assault on jewish personhood and statehood being perpetrated from gaza and reflected on our college campuses. while we were in israel, time and time again israelis lamented the lack of support and the uptick in antisemitism on our college campuses. i know that you are concerned by it, too.

may executive director address



apr 29, 2024




this year’s passover-related, “happy holiday” greetings were eclipsed by the realization we’re living in particularly dark and unhappy times. it’s not enough that israel was thrown on its heels in october 2023. to add further insult to the egregious injury, support for hamas and cascading antisemitism is on full display at some of our nation’s best universities—rendering them unsafe for jews. it all leaves me with a sour feeling.
