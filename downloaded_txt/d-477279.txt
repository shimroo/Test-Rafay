a storytelling, research, and design studio making our way toward an equitable and liberatory world







































it starts with listening.listening opens a space of understanding, where the truths of people, places, and communities can be heard and understood. listening is at the center of all our practices across storytelling, research, design, strategy, and facilitation.















storytelling as a slow design practiceif research helps us make sense of the world, then storytelling is where it all begins. through storytelling, we honor lived experience and complexity — bridging distance across identities, cultures, and geographies. we return to storytelling as a slow research and design practice, a way to create in relationship with one another.















creating in partnership with changemakerslong-run impact is stewarded by changemakers: those with the truest connection to a place, a challenge, a vision. as a studio, we partner and create with people, organizations, and movements centering dignity, equity, and freedom to create the world we want to see.
