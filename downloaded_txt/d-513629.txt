isaiah berlin in 1939, the year in which karl marx was published: photo by helen muspratt

isaiah berlin (1909–1997) was one of the most celebrated thinkers of the twentieth century. his defence of freedom and diversity against control and uniformity is widely endorsed. his distinction between the monist hedgehog and the pluralist fox, and his celebration of ‘the crooked timber of humanity’, have entered the vocabulary of modern culture, together with his widely influential elaboration of the concepts of ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ political liberty. a consummate essayist and letter-writer, he was famous for his virtuosity as a lecturer and talker. his distinctive deep, rapid voice was often heard on the radio, and he led many to explore his chosen subject – the history of ideas. he founded oxford’s largest graduate college, wolfson, which expresses his generous, unhidebound personality to this day.
‘one of the distinguishing characteristics of a great man is that his active intervention makes what seemed highly improbable in fact happen’
isaiah berlin, ‘chaim weizmann’ (1958)
call for copies of interviews and talks
isaiah berlin gave many interviews during his life, public and private, and also many talks. the public interviews are listed here. the private interviews were mostly given to biographers and other authors. berlin’s literary trustees would like to secure copies of as many as possible of these interviews and talks: copies of recordings where they exist, and copies of any transcripts or notes. the webmaster would be glad to hear from interviewers and any others who are able to help.

the isaiah berlin virtual library (ibvl) began life in 2000 as the website of the isaiah berlin literary trust, which looks after all aspects of berlin’s literary estate. it was superseded in this role in february 2018 by isaiah berlin online (ibo), part of the isaiah berlin legacy project (iblp) at wolfson. ibo is curated by the isaiah berlin legacy fellow, dr mark pottle. the trust’s main tasks have been to publish berlin’s work, including his letters; to maintain this website, where unpublished material and relevant information are posted; and in general to foster awareness of and access to berlin’s intellectual, literary and personal legacy. the primary responsibility for pursuing these objectives now belongs to the iblp.
the ibvl will remain available, at any rate for the time being, while ibo grows. pdfs posted from february 2022 display the livery of ibo, with which they are shared. it is hoped that these websites may help bring to light those of berlin’s letters that are still unknown to the trust (some of which are in library archives, some in private hands), so that copies may be deposited in his archive and transcripts made available in print or online. the same applies to any interviews, broadcasts and unpublished talks or articles not yet listed in the catalogues on this site.
