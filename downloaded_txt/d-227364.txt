belonging




i love that lvc fosters a supportive community inside and outside of the classroom. lebanon valley college is a place where students choose to lead study pods and tutoring sessions to help their peers, professors attend sporting events to support their students, and the president volunteers with students at local community service events.

elevation




my lvc mba helped with my strategic thinking and analytical skills. it gave me insights into other areas of business and global markets and allowed me to grow my professional network. it truly elevated my career experience.

friendly faces




i wanted a smaller school, and lvc provided me with a tight-knit community. besides the 3+2 program they offered, i chose lvc because everyone i passed smiled, waved, or said hi to me when i toured!
