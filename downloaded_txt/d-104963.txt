promoting and preserving our local history

the heritage library is a private, not-for-profit research center that provides resources including a wealth of historical information, photographs, and maps of hilton head island and the lowcountry for a modest daily fee or affordable annual membership. the library is an affiliate of the family search library in salt lake city operated by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints which allows access to some of their restricted records. also, patrons of the heritage library have access to major online databases at ancestry, fold3 (formerly footnote), american ancestors (formerly nehgs), and heritagequest online through our network.









join the library

as a member, you will have full access to the library facilities, publications, classes and our online resources as well as the talents and expertise of our volunteers who will help with your research project.
