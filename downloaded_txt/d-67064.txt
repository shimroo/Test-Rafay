who we are

the pennsylvania senate republicans are the voice of state taxpayers and families. for decades, pennsylvania voters have chosen senate gop majorities to stand as an unwavering defense against massive tax increases and reckless government spending.

we believe the strength of our historic commonwealth comes from families and the stable communities they build and not from the state. by working to remove the heavy hand of government from job creators, we fight to promote the growth of good, family-supporting jobs and thriving, safe communities.
