emily andaya, dance bfa ’26, was searching for a premiere dance program when she found the uo bfa. she knew uo would help her grow as an artist and dancer. “we view dance as a form of research here – we study the art form. we learn how to apply ourselves as human beings and we form a sense of artistry. in each of our technique classes, we learn movement, but we also learn to perform, to create, and to explore what our work can mean beyond just what we exert with our bodies. the best part is the incredible talent of other dancers from around the country that are here working with you every day.”
 









building a versatile career as a professional flutist and educator, dr. jacqueline cordova-arrington is committed to collaborating with distinguished artists, citizens, and thinkers to create inspiring and culturally unifying experiences for communities and artists alike. as a fellow of carnegie hall’s ensemble connect —formerly known as ensemble acjw—jacqueline had innumerable opportunities to accomplish this mission, creating tangible impact as a performer, educator and community advocate.meet our faculty
