victor, mtnovember 2019 






						he was extremely patient. he took the time to show us every house that we were interested in looking at. he even took us back to some houses multiple times so we could get a second glance before making a decision. he is extremely knowledgeable of this area. he knew things we should be concerned about and gave us tips on things to look out for. i truly felt like he was there to help us make the best decision and find the right home for our family.

						[he] was great to work with! he helped us navigate a very challenging home and property buy. he was patient, prompt and communicated well with us and the sellers throughout the entire process. 					


hamilton, mtnovember 2019 






						[he] has shown us multiple properties, all at the convenience of our busy schedule. he has been very respectful of the types of homes we wanted to see and did not try and show us anything that we were not interested in. 					


corvallis, mtaugust 2012 






						[she] has extensive knowledge of the area and was as thorough with helping us evaluate properties as i would expect she would be had she been the buyer. we trust her completely.
