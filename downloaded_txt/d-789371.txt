miniature-inch series
our selection of “straight-style” radial-inch bearings.  all of the bearings we make are miniatures, but these feature a straight chassis, as opposed to a flanged, and/or extended inner option.

full-complement bearings
these utilize filling notches or angular contact design to maximize ball quantity, which eliminates the need for a retainer/cage.  this design increases the load capacity.
view products
custom & specialty
these bearings could have “modified attributes”, including non-standard bores, outside diameters, widths, and internal geometry.
view productsminiature-inch flanged series
our offerings with outer ring flanges.  the flange assists in positioning and mounting of the bearing.
view products
angular contact bearings
these bearings can withstand high radial and axial loads, while reaching high rpm’s.  angular contact bearings are also highlighted in the use of duplex-paired bearings (sets).
