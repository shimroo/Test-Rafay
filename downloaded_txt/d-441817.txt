monsters dance is open to all ages 6 year and older, kid through adult!








            how do i know which level to register for?
          










we offer the following as a guide only, placing more emphasis on years of experience versus dancer age. use your best judgment, and if you need to change levels, you may do so prior to the third class commencing on the first day of the event, space permitting. additional fees will apply if switching from junior level to intermediate/advanced level.junior level: recommended for beginner dancers, ages 6-10. includes a full weekend of classes (2 fewer class than int/adv levels). in some cities the junior and intermediate levels may be combined.intermediate level: recommended for dancers aged 11-14 with 3+ years of experience.advanced level: recommended for advanced dancers ages 15 and over, with 6+ years of high level hip hop/commercial training.industry upgrade: for advanced, pre-professional dancers aged 16 years and older.  includes full weekend of classes plus a 2-hour friday evening industry session. each session will be focused on a specific topic and provides dancers training in navigating within the dance industry (for example, how to audition, performing with an artist, working with props, etc). must be 16 or older.click here for dancer level examples!

yes you can! log back into your monsters account to add more dancers to your group, space permitting. additional dancers may not be added if desired level is sold out.








            can an individual dancer register for monsters, or do you have to be with a group?

the club stylz showcase is a performance/exhibition opportunity for groups of 4+ dancers, with (optional) faculty critiques.it’s your opportunity to be seen by and receive feedback from the industry’s top choreographers. the club stylz showcase is a non-competitive and very supportive environment where your dancers can perform without the pressure of a competition.click here for more information.
