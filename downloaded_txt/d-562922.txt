a future to best the past

















      a sparkling neighborhood
    

      placed on the national registry of historic places in 1985, providence’s historic jewelry district is poised on the verge of a bright new future as a dynamic neighborhood. it has the rich architectural heritage of a once thriving manufacturing area. and thanks to the relocation of an interstate highway, it’s transforming into a vibrant live-work-play neighborhood.

      a sense of community
    

      the jewelry district association (jda) is dedicated to fostering a sense of community that will encourage thoughtful development of this new land. the jda believes that a respect for the past and a focus on creating a walkable, bikeable, livable environment will help make our district welcoming for business and residents alike. the jda holds monthly meetings, open to the public.
