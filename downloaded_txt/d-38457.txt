what our members love.            







wings handled a lot of extra legwork for us. the benefit of going through the credit union is astronomical.

claire a.
member since 2015








our mortgage process went very smoothly. our loan officer was willing to take the time to explain and help with any questions we had – there was great communication throughout the process. any issues we had, it gave us peace of mind knowing that he was there to help.

terri b. & william c.
member since 2017 and 1997





wings stepped up big-time today as we dealt with some fraud issues on our account. we were treated like humans with empathy and were able to get everything resolved. thank you for caring about your clients. we will be members for life!

ryan f.
