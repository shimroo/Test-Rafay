	 kittygarten
	 
    


today starts the girls' second week of elementary school.  they seemed rather excited to go this morning, calling it "kittygarten".  it's still difficult for me to believe that they are 5 years old.  the years are beginning to pass way too quickly!

	 blog
	 
    


you know, i used to be really good at this 'blogging' thing...  not so  much anymore.  who has time??  actually, like anything else, i guess it  comes down to priorities.  so, i'm sitting here tonight, thinking about  going to bed, and i figured that i'd write something.my girls  experienced their first 'sick week' after starting preschool.  i've been  guaranteed it will not be their last.  olivia started the week with a  chest cold and isabella stayed home from school today with it.  (the  girls and i have started going to preschool on fridays for an hour in  the morning.)  they seem to enjoy school and are getting better at it  each week.  olivia and i actually got through the morning today without  any meltdowns!  yes!!i now understand some of the comments that  my mom used to make... "boy, i wish i had half of their energy" and  "i've changed my name!" are two that come to mind right away.  oui.we  are getting ready to knock out our kitchen.  i'm excited, but  terrified.  when we first moved to california we hit the ground running  remodeling this house.  we rocked it hard for about 6 months and i hit a  major burnout.  we've taken a break and have now decided that it's time  to get this kitchen taken care of.  we've chosen our cabinets and  layout and now just need to turn over the big 'lets get started' check  so the cabinet guys can get to work.  we'll be shopping for granite in  the next few weeks.  i'll snap some photos and share the process...  why  oh why can't someone figure out how to get to the final result with the  snap of a finger or the wiggle of a nose?!i finally applied for  my california drivers license today...  spending an hour and a half at  the dmv reminded me why i procrastinated in getting that done.  and i  had an appointment.whew, okay...  enough blogging for now.  :)

	 mother's day
	 
    


it's mother's day and i sit here reflecting on the meaning of family while the girls and chad take a nap.i  think back through the years growing up in my family and am so thankful  to have been 'given' the mother and father that i have, along with my  brother and two sisters and their spouses/significant others.  one of  the things i love most about my family is that i can be a complete ass  one day and wake up the next knowing without a shadow of a doubt that my  family is going to love and accept me just as much as they always  have... it's nice.  i'm truly thankful for my family.i am also  thankful for my husband, whom i have chosen to spend the rest of my life  with, and our beautiful daughters.  chad has always been an amazing man  to me and now daddy to the girls (it makes my heart sing to watch him  with them).  we, like everyone, have had our ups and downs, but i would  not trade my life with chad and our girls for anything, ever.  i love  them with all of my heart.  they mean the world to me.i guess  this is a bit sappy and silly, but i have been thinking about family all  day and i just want to remind all of you what a gift family is.  you  may not always like each other, but like it or not, it is what it is.   families are not chosen, they're given to you...  be good to each other.read more:  http://www.myspace.com/staciehodges/blog#ixzz118wjthpn

	 i love...
	 
    


my friend mae just posted a great blog about the things she loves.  it's  nice to think about the things you love, so i'm going to do the same...1)  i love my girls more than anything!  they are amazing!!  just this  evening isabella taught herself to blow bubbles in the bath tub (causing  herself, olivia and me to laugh insanely every time she did it), and  olivia learned to run (she's been walking for weeks now, and this  evening she decided to pick up the pace and run circles in the family  room for a good 15 minutes straight).2) i love chad just as much  as i love my girls!  he has seen me at my worst and still thinks i'm  great.  he is my one and only, true love.  i am so lucky!  i would be  lost without him.  he absolutely completes me!3) i love my  family.  i have the most amazing family!  it's crazy, but we actually  enjoy spending time with each other!  my folks have been married for  almost 38 years and they're still in love...  my brother, pippin &  matt are a lot of fun to hang out with and my sisters...  beck, sarah  & lydia are the best friends/sisters a girl could have.  they rock!   (i wish we all lived closer...)4) i love red wine and great margaritas!  (do ya really need an explanation for that one??)5) i love lattes!!  i can't start my day without one (or 2... sometimes 3)6)  i love to travel.  there is something about experiencing a new place  that i will always love.  meeting new people.  experiencing new  cultures...  just getting on an airplane has always been exciting to  me...  i've always wanted to learn to fly...7) i love laughing!!   is there anything better?  i really believe that laughter is great  medicine!  i believe that happiness is a choice and laughter just makes  everything feel better.  being negative just ages you...  think about  it...8) i love the west coast!  i just moved to san diego and  love everything about it (with the exception that my family is not near  by).  everything is so beautiful out here!  even after the fires...9)  i love the rain.  something about listening to rain fall is so  soothing.  i love thunderstorms.  i could sit and listen for hours.and last, but certainly not least...10) i love the men and women who serve our country!!  thank you!read more:  http://www.myspace.com/staciehodges/blog#ixzz118vilveo

           so, i turn  33 tomorrow...  and i'm excited.  i have to say that, so far, my 30's  have been pretty darn great.  i've become a mother and moved to the west  coast, two very good things.  i'm anxious to see what the 3rd year of  my 30's has to bring...

	 carpet is evil
	 
    


so, i mentioned that we're remodeling, right? have i ever mentioned how much i hate carpet?  the stuff is downright nasty.have  any of you been fortunate enough to have the task of pulling the  dreadful mess up to put in new floors?  i've done it a few times...   this time was, by far, the worst. we've been in this house for  about 3 months now.  very shortly after moving in i pulled the carped up  in the bathrooms (yes, i said bathrooms...).  it's been bare slab in  there for awhile now. i pulled up the rest of the carpet on  saturday with the help of my wonderful neighbor and friend, anna.  we  started in the living area and worked our way back to the bedrooms.  the  girls' room was the last to come up.  it was also the most disgusting.   there was mold under their carpet!!  pulling their carpet up was worse  than pulling the bathroom carpet up.  i still get the heebies thinking  about it.  they slept in my room saturday night...  i bleached their  slab several times...  and you  know what?  they actually slept through  the night last night for the first time in months!  coincidence?   maybe...  but maybe it is because their room is finally clean.our tile guy starts installing our tile in about 2 weeks.  it's going everywhere.  even the bedrooms...  i can't wait!

	 christening
	 
    


the girls were christened aboard chad's ship yesterday.  it was a  beautiful ceremony.  the crew really pulled together with very little  notice and made it very memorable for us.  my parents, jason &  lydia, and saran & pippin drove in from panama city.  chad's parents  flew in from las vegas, and his aunts flew in from raleigh, nc and  sarasota, fl.  of course jimmy, anita & emma were there for the  occasion, and several of the ship's crew came.  the weekend went by  entirely too fast...chad's at work yet again tonight.  he has 24  hour duty every 3rd day and is working 12 hour days in between...  i  sometimes wonder how i manage to do the things i do without my husband  around or family nearby for support... today would have been  one of the days i would have called on someone to lend a hand.  the  girls were a little extra fussy today, probably due to the added  excitement over the past few days.  and i wasn't feeling that well.   exhaustion i guess.  there are a lot of things that i still need to  do...  finish cleaning the house, attempt to catch up on the laundry,  follow up with the movers to insure they have scheduled a date and time  to come out to pack us up, figure out our travel plans for the move,  send out thank you cards...  it seems like the list goes on and on...i  guess i need to stop typing and put the mac to bed...  the house is  finally quiet, the girls seem to have fallen asleep...  for now anyway.   i guess i should try to get some sleep too.

	 i am so proud of myself!
	 
    


olivia has started standing up while hanging on to the side of the playpen.  she seems so proud when she does it.  she watches what’s going on over the top and grins and grins...  her fourth tooth (lower right lateral incisor) finally came through this morning.  isabella still has just her bottom two teeth.  i feel sure that she’ll have another one or two come through just any day now.

	 isabella is sitting
	 
    


isabella has been able to sit up on her own for seconds at a time for a couple of weeks now, but this morning she sat all by herself for a good couple of minutes.  the girls look so grown up sitting on the floor playing with their toys!they’ve both been quite fussy for the past week.  i think they must have more teeth ready to come in.  it’s a good thing that we don’t cut teeth as adults...  i don’t think any of us could handle it.

	 olivia...
	 
    


olivia has continued blowing raspberries, and aside from meal time we don’t mind.  this morning while she was eating her cereal she kept doing it and after my second face full of pears and oatmeal i put my finger on her lips and very firmly said ‘no!’.  she did not like being ‘disciplined’ and her little eyes welled up with tears (she seems to be able to turn the faucets on whenever she wants...) and she threw her arms in the air wanting me to pick her up.  i said to her again, ‘no, olivia.  you can’t keep spitting your food.  it’s yucky.’  we actually went a couple of minutes without her doing it and she finished her cereal...  as i type this she’s blowing raspberries at isabella while they watch baby mozart...  (sigh)

	 girls day out
	 
    


today the girls, marcy and i drove over to fairhope, al.  it’s a quaint little town with cute little stores.  we parked and walked around, shopped a little and ate lunch.  isabella and olivia really enjoyed the crackers at ‘old bay steamer’.  we would give them a pack and they would chew on it and bang it on the table until the plastic would get a hole in it.  then we would take it away and give them another...  they sat in high chairs for the first time!  they looked so grown up!!  of course them sitting in them didn’t last the entire meal.  marcy and i both ended up holding one of the girls while we ate our meals.  oh well...  our girls day out was lots of fun!

marcy got here a day later due to the storms...  so instead of flying in saturday evening, she came in yesterday afternoon.  the girls have really enjoyed having an extra set of arms around the house...  especially olivia, who has begun to have an automatic ‘pick-me-up reaction’ (arms go straight up in the air toward you) when you walk by.

(especially me i think...  i love having an extra set of arms around the house!)she has been really good about flying out every other month since the girls have been born, and she’s a huge help while she’s here.  i think this time the girls may have changed the most between visits...  they both have teeth now, are starting to sit up on their own and have become oh so vocal!

	 we have a biter
	 
    


this afternoon i took the trash down to the curb for pick-up in the morning.  i left the door open so i could hear the girls, who were playing in their playpen together.  i got about halfway up the driveway and i heard isabella start screaming.  i thought ‘what in the world??’ as i started running back into the house to find olivia with a firm grip on isabella’s foot...  she was chewing on it!  she didn’t want to let it go either...  she very innocently looked at me as if to say ‘what...?’ as i picked isabella up to calm her down.  poor little thing has red nibble marks on her foot!  (you can see them in the photo...)  maybe isabella will nibble on olivia in a day or two to even things out...

so, for several weeks now, olivia has been ‘blowing raspberries’.  we think it’s real cute when she does it, and she gets a kick out of making us laugh.  well, tonight she decided to do it with a mouth full of green beans...  nice.  i had green beans on my face, in my hair, on my clothes and on the wall behind me.  it was quite a site.  i tried my best not to laugh as i said ‘no, olivia!  that’s yucky!!’

	 road trip
	 
    


this morning my parents (they drove to mobile last night), the girls and i got up at 4:00 am to drive to louisville, ky to visit with family (my grandparents, aunts and cousins).  it took us 9 1/2 hours to make the drive and the girls did great!  i’m so proud of them!  (whoever created baby einstein is a genius... and the little portable dvd players for your automobile...  how did my parents stay sane without those!?)i’ve driven to panama city with them a few times (about a 3 1/2 hour drive) and they’ve always done pretty well.  i’ve been able to plan it where they eat right before we leave and most of the time they make it to our destination without me having to stop.  i was a little nervous about how they’d react to a longer drive, but like i said, they were such great little travelers!  i hope this is a glimpse of how they’ll be whenever we travel in the future...we are scheduled to fly to las vegas in may for mark (chad’s brother) and charity’s wedding, and i have nightmares of us getting on the plane and the girls screaming the entire 5 hours...  i’ll keep you posted on how it turns out...

today isabella and olivia are 32 weeks old.  they were born at 32 weeks gestation...  which means they have now been in the world the same length of time that they were in my belly.why is it that when i was pregnant the time seemed to pass so slowly?  and now that the girls are here it seems to fly by?the girls seem to change a little every day.  it’s so much fun watching them discover new things!

	 happy new year!
	 
    


i haven't written in a while...  i seem to be tied up more and more these days.  imagine that.the girls are doing really well.  they went in for their 4 month check up on december 15th.  isabella weighed in at 13 pounds 5 ounces and olivia 11 pounds 9 ounces.  we were given the okay to start them on some 'solid' foods (more like 'mushy' foods).  they seem to enjoy the different tastes, really liking peaches, pears and green beans so far.  at their appointment we were given the okay to travel to panama city for christmas since the girls have had 2 of their synergis shots and we promised to continue being 'crazy/overprotective' parents when it comes to keeping them healthy...we had a wonderful christmas, especially since my whole family was together.  beck and matt were in from texas, and it was really nice seeing matt since he had just come home from his second tour in iraq.  everyone stayed at my parents house christmas eve, so we all woke up under the same roof christmas morning...  i imagine it will probably be some time before we'll all be able to do that again...  (we have our move out to california in the spring, and all of my siblings are considering big moves this year as well...)  the girls did very well being away from home for the first time.  i thinknew years was pretty low key.  we invited a couple people that chad works with over to the house.  we had lots of 'finger foods' and chad shot off fire works, which is always fun.

	 they're going bald!
	 
    


the girls have started rubbing their hair off in the back... i had started thinking that they weren't going to loose their hair... i guess i was wrong. i failed to mention in my last post that they finally got their synergis shots last week. it was pretty easy... a nurse came out to the house and gave it to them. they didn't like it, of course, but this should help to keep them healthy during rsv season. so far, so good... i'm sure it has helped that we've kept them locked up at home. i guess we'll continue to do that until the spring. i have become a hermit!we are looking forward to thanksgiving. my parents are coming here to spend the holiday with us since we are unable to travel to see them. this will be the first time we've had thanksgiving at our house... in 12 years! we're excited... chad and i both enjoy cooking.after my folks leave, chad's mom is coming to spend a week. it will be so nice having an extra set of hands around the house! there are days when i would love to hire a nanny, or on second thought, a housekeeper to help out! it seems as though i never get it all done anymore. i've been told to expect that for the next 18 years... (big sigh) we'll see...

	 bad news...
	 
    


 i spoke with the girls pediatrician yesterday evening regarding them not starting their synagis shots yet... long story, but it is a 6 month series of injections that i thought was supposed to help to keep the girls healthy through rsv season. somewhere along the line, someone has dropped the ball in getting the medications ordered. my girls are among about 50 children in the local area who are waiting to get their shots... needless to say, i'm not a very happy camper... in speaking with their doctor, i asked if we needed to cancel our plans to travel for thanksgiving and christmas since they've not been immunized. she said that if it were her children, she would not expose them to anyone unnecessarily. apparently, anyone with a cold could be carring the rsv virus. she explained that the synagis shots do not prevent the girls from getting rsv, but prevents them from dying from it...(!) so, we will not be traveling to panama city for the holidays this year. we'll be keeping the girls locked up until rsv season is over in april... i was really looking forward to spending the holidays with my family, especially since matt and beck will be coming in for christmas, but we've got to do what's best for the girls, and keeping them healthy and out of the hospital is our number one priority. here are a couple photos of the girls taken this week...(olivia is on the left and isabella is on the right in both photos)

	 sunday walk
	 
    


we took the girls for a walk today…  we were going to us their double stroller,  but when we got outside, the little shades on top wouldn't keep the sun out of the girl's eyes...  so we resorted to using the baby bjorns (which i like better anyway). it was a nice walk...  warm outside, but not too warm.  i love this time of year when the weather is changing.
