        testimonials and success stories    



 

i came to the arc looking for a job and i’ve found so much more - family, friends, and the opportunity to learn and make an amazing difference not only in my life but all those i come in contact with. i am truly blessed to be a part of such a wonderful place and to work side by side with such loving and caring people. i respect each and every one of you for all that you do.
–rachel young,human resources department the arc of rensselaer county
 

fourteen years ago i met a very special young woman who changed my life forever. i grew up here, i learned about relationships and unconditional love. i always tell people that once you meet the people you will be supporting you will form a bond that lasts forever. i have learned the joy in assisting people to achieve the things in life that matter to them.
–lisa anderson,director of family supports & self-direction the arc of rensselaer county
 

i choose to work at the arc of rensselaer because of how we do our work. i have been with many other agencies, and none of them put the welfare of the people we support in the forefront as much as we do. every day i am witness to people and staff making life richer, happier and more meaningful. we really do connect people to their community in a way that fosters importance and relationships. the old adage that “i get more than i give” rings true at the arc of rensselaer.
 - kim burns,retired from residential services
 

honestly, i have been working in this field for at least 20 years. i love working in this field because i enjoy helping others. especially for our guys that cannot advocate or do for themselves.  sometimes it is overwhelming but that's why it's good to go on vacation:) i look at this field like parenting...you know the things that you would want/don't want for your child. to sum it up if you have the heart & stomach for this field then you will last a very long time:)
 

when i first started working here over 20 years ago, i thought it wasn’t for me. since that time i have come to realize the people we support every day have taught me more than i could ever teach them. they have shown me empathy, compassion, and understanding. with that has come a deeper understanding of life and enjoying the small successes. we sometimes tend to focus more on failures instead of celebrating what really matters.
 

i do this work because i find myself looking forward to every day. the people we support have taught me so much about themselves. people have broken dozens of preconceived notions i had, and have proven to me over and over, how truly wonderful and capable they are. the experience motivates me and has helped me learn so much about myself, and has become a truly formative and awe-inspiring experience.
 

i do this work because of my belief everyone deserves our kindness and respect. the spirit of the individuals we work with reminds me to be blessed by what you have. the compassion of our workforce gives me an appreciation of the good qualities that exist in people. the collective energy gives me the drive to fight for better outcomes for our family. i invite you to join our efforts with us; we have many opportunities for you to make a difference for many individuals; including yourself.
