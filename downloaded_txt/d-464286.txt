i’m going to speak for everyone on our conference team – the best thing we did in the whole process was partner with eventage. you were so integral in bringing the program to life and making it as enjoyable and powerful as it was.

ironically, it's almost 20 years to the day that i've been working with eventage. for 20 years - you always deliver and hit it out the park. i appreciate you all so much!

in this business, i think we all know it's not "if" things go awry but "when." it's reassuring to know we have partners like you in place to help make the event go off without a hitch in our participant's eyes.

we could not -- and should not -- ever imagine pulling off an event of this scale, complexity, and importance without you.  every extra way you go above and beyond for us does not go unnoticed. thank you!
