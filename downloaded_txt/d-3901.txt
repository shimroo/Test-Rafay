information regarding the new required obd and visual emissions testing equipment
 the emissions inspection program was developed by the departments 
                    of transportation and environmental protection with input 
                    from the public and the various representatives of the auto 
                    industry.
tailored to meet pennsylvania's specific air quality improvement 
                    needs, the program focuses on motorist convenience and choice.
if required for your vehicle, the emissions inspection is 
                    due once a year at the same time or before your annual safety 
                    inspection.
