how do we differ from a zoo?
we take in hurt and injured wildlife, rehabilitate it, and release it back to the wild. most of the animals at the everglades outpost have been confiscated from illegal, traumatic and abusive situations. we are different from a zoo in that we are a non-profit run by idealistic volunteers who love and want to help animals.










how do we help animals?
our rehabilitation facility provides medical care and treatment to sick and injured animals. whenever possible, the animal is released to its natural habitat. the animals that cannot be returned to the wild are placed in suitable homes, or remain here under our care.










how can you help this effort?
we are a non-profit 501c(3) educational organization. we are all volunteers. we rely on friends like you to come here to experience the everglades outpost and help with tax-deductible donations, so we can take care of the animals, and continue to improve and expand our habitats for them.





  





support the outpost through amazon.  ++ interested? please contact us.

has a rescue story:





  





sabal is a florida panther who was born into captivity. she had a brother, and they were both very sick when they were born. the brother died and the owner gave sabal to the outpost. watch the video.










kenya is a lemur. his former owner had all his teeth pulled so he couldn’t bite. so kenya began to need a special diet, which became too much work for the owner who decided to give kenya away…watch the video.










despite its name, gator is actually a pelican. he was rescued in the everglades national park, where he showed no fear at all of people. one of his wings was broken…watch the video.





  





zulu is a zebra who was originally acquired for a kids camp. management didn’t know that zebras are basically wild horses and not quite suitable for kids…watch the video.










godzilla is an alligator who was brought to the outpost as a hatchling in 1988 by florida fish and game officers. he has a prickly temperament…watch the video.
