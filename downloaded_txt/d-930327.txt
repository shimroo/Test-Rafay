the doe must reduce their administrative costs and not school budgets
























there is no doubt that the doe must reduce their administrative costs but don't be surprised if the majority of cuts come from the schools and classrooms. susan edelman of the new york post wrote a very insightful article that explains where the cuts should come from.  however, look for the majority of education budget cuts to come from the schools.

the doe has loopholes in the hiring freeze




















the doe has quietly informed principals that the hiring freeze has loopholes and they can still hire special education, bilingual, and shortage areas like math and science.  look for principals to hire "newbies" by falsely claiming that all the hires are either certified in those fields or in the process of attaining such certification.

as for atrs?  look for principals to try their hardest to carve out exceptions to the hiring freeze so as not to hire an atr for their vacancies.  will the union leadership make sure that principals follow the rules?  based on past performance by our union leadership i highly doubt it since they get double dues.by keeping the atr and the "newbie" they hire.

it appears chapter 683 summer pay will continue for district 75

































there has been no decision whether nys will have a summer school program since neither the state or city government will have funds to pay for the programs.  however, for special education programs in district 75, it appears that the chapter 683 program will be continued this summer, be it remote learning or actual classroom instruction.

chapter 683 is a federally funded program that pays special education schools to provide year-round instruction.  in new york city it is district 75 schools who provide instruction for the most severely disabled students in the new york city public schools.

chapter 683 pays eligible educators 17.5% of their annual salary and it's pensionable.  the program usually starts before independence day (july 4th) and ends no later than august 15th.  educators get two absence days and if the educator does not use them, they go into the educator's cumulative absence reserve (car) .

note:  some community advocates want the doe to pass all students, regardless if they participate in remote learning.  you can read it here.

mayor bill de blasio is an idiot











mayor bill de blasio told reporters who questioned him on what children will do in the summer if the pools and playgrounds are closed.  his response was that he and chancellor richard carranza are working on remote learning programs to entertain the children. what an idiot the mayor is.

most nyc children live in old apartment buildings, many with no air conditioning or can't afford the bills by running the air conditioner all day.   even during the school year, only 77% of the teenagers actually logged in for attendance and even less who actually participated in instruction.  the probable result is that many streets will have open fire hydrants and teenagers climbing fences to play basketball or using playground equipment. other bored teenagers will be up to no good like street crimes and assaulting each other.

it appears most uft members who have died from covid-19 are from the bronx or brooklyn which is primary minority and have high density housing.  moreover, they tend to use mass transit as their mode of transportation. finally, these two boroughs have higher percentages of health issues.

is this the end of the atr pool?





























the just released drastic cuts in the city budget by mayor bill de blasio includes a hiring freeze of educators except schools can hire atrs for their vacancies. since each year the new york city public schools needs to hire between 4 to 5 thousand teachers and there are one thousand atrs, it would seem that, except for art, music, and gym teachers the rest of the atrs should be placed. here is what uft president michael mulgrew told the new york post.

that means that there still will be a reduction in teachers and more overcrowded classrooms unless the mayor rescinds the hiring freeze. i expect the union leadership will be unhappy since less teachers means less dues.  moreover, by placing the atrs in vacancies the union no longer will be getting double dues.  finally, there are some principals who will refuse to hire atrw in the mistaken belief that the atrs are inferior teachers and will either try to seek a waiver from the hiring freeze or steal another school's teacher.  we will see if the mayor and chancellor will keep the hiring freeze ironclad.

 the mayor's proposed budget can be found on james eterno's iceuft blog.

mayor de blasio & chancellor richard carranza have blood on their hands

































at least 47 school based adults, including 3 school safety officers, have died and it is highly likely that the mayor and chancellor's resistance in closing the schools could have resulted in unnecessary deaths.   fortunately, the coronavirus seems not to adversely affect school age students but they are carriers to their adult relatives and school based personnel and contributed to the rapid spread of the virus in new york city. one doctor believes that 80% of the children in the city are carriers of the coronavirus.

the doe, under intense pressure, finally released the death count of 
doe employees and it has totaled 50 so far with more to come.  of the 50
 employees at least 44 were uft members, including 21 teachers, 22 
paraprofessionals, and one guidance counselor.  .of course there is no 
way of knowing how many became sick because the city refused to close 
schools earlier,  read the entire new york post article here.

region........infected............deaths.........percentage

global........2,173,168.........144,943.............6.7%

nyc.............123,146..........11,477...............9.3%

uft.................?...................44

read the opinion article from a parent about the problems in remote learning.  moreover,
 teachers no longer trust mayor bill de blasio and chancellor richard 
carranza who delayed closing schools and have blood on their hands read 
it here.

chaz's quotes

 "a strong union represents all the members in the trenches and does not agree to a caste system that  diminish the rights of some of them as our leadership has"."a union that allows its members to be disrespected, is a union that no longer deserves the respect of its members"."when our educational leaders ignore input from the classroom teachers, the programs they push are destined  to fail".the doe motto "students lie.....except when it's          about their teacher".



a teacher who cares about his students & tries to do his best



stop disrespecting teachers & let teachers teach in the classroom
