nuts & bolts: interview with john harrison, netflix series creator, author of residue: paramentals rising

 february 12, 2025
 no comments



early in his career, writer and director john harrison picked up techniques about telling a horror story from collaborating with george romero. he’s spent decades refining those techniques as a screenwriter, director, and novelist – most recently in a new novel that released on the 11th of this month, residue: paramentals rising, based on the netflix series he created. in this month’s edition of nuts & bolts, john shares his thoughts about telling a horror story and storytelling in general. he also gives advice about releasing a book, and getting into tv writing. 






genesis – the first black horror writers/storytellers by linda d. addison

 february 10, 2025
 no comments



horror —n: an overwhelming and painful feeling caused by something frightfully shocking, terrifying, or revolting; a shuddering fear.
who were the first black horror writers in a country that made enslaved africans’ everyday life horrific? how did stories develop and what were their themes?
i wanted to write this because of my own curiosity. i didn’t know where this was going to lead me but the more i dug the more i found. the yellow brick road of discovery took me away from the land of published authors to places unexpected. 






black heritage in horror month: an interview with marc l. abbott

 february 10, 2025
 no comments



what inspired you to start writing?
this is always a difficult question to answer because i have always loved writing. my imagination was always running wild and growing up, rather than paying attention to lessons in class, i was writing stories in the middle of my notebooks. i used to look forward to doing creative writing with spelling words in elementary school. but my inspiration for starting to take writing seriously was in high school. i had a teacher, mr. dolan, who was always encouraging me to tell my stories. one open school night he told my parents “your son is a writer and is really good at it. you should help him nurture that talent because he can go far with it.” he was one of those teachers who always believed in what i could do. i had told my parents i wanted to be a writer, and they weren’t a hundred percent behind it as a profession with my father saying that i had to be good at the craft to make it. that was before mr. dolan told him this news. and until i heard mr. dolan say this, i thought about finding something else to pursue. but he confirmed that small belief i had in myself, and it inspired me to go forward with it. 






black heritage in horror month 2025: an interview with jamal hodge

 february 3, 2025
 1 comment



what inspired you to start writing?
pain, uncertainty, and hope. honestly, i was a naive child, filled with joy at the thought of meeting another face. but when homelessness found my family in the south bronx, i quickly learned that people weren’t always safe. being exposed to ‘american history’ in school further revealed what it meant to be black in this country, a trauma, in my view, that demands mental health support, like counseling, in schools. these harsh realities made me dream of a better world. i found that place within the pages of books, the ink of a pen, and the boundless depths of my own imagination.

something new, something old, something different:  hwa celebrating black history month 2025

 february 3, 2025
 no comments



the worldview of horror writers, editors, screenwriters, etc. population is a plethora of different groups. the definition of groups within a demographic is large and multi-faceted. one thing horror creators have in common is they want their work to generate a sense of fear or discomfort in the reader or viewer. this work is influenced by the experiences of the group in the world and their individual lives. each creator’s work is flavored by the disturbing aspects of their life and the world around them. the hwa runs a monthly series each year highlighting horror writers and editors, etc. from different marginalized groups.

whether they come by way of oz, wonderland, or the brothers grimm, nightmare-inducing children’s stories are the gateway for many nascent fans into the strange, terrifying, and delightful genre of horror fiction. joe r. lansdale took a crack at children’s horror fiction with the ray bradbury-influenced something lumber this way comes, which is being rereleased by pandi press this month. kasey lansdale, executive editor of pandi press, provides some useful information about the publishing industry for aspiring authors in this month’s edition of nuts & bolts.  and joe gives some tips on writing children’s fiction.

 december 17, 2024
 comments closed



the market is crowded, the rules of social media are constantly changing, and the logistics of building a catalogue are more complicated than ever. the good news, according to author clay mcleod chapman, is that time-tested strategies such as supporting other authors and finding a unique voice will still get the job done. in this month’s edition of nuts & bolts, he gives advice for beginning authors about getting their material in print.

nuts & bolts: “rambo” creator david morrell discusses his mentor

 november 15, 2024
 1 comment



before he could create vietnam veteran john j. rambo in first blood, thriller and horror author david morrell had to find that pesky “ferret.” that’s how his mentor philip klass, aka legendary science fiction author william tenn, used to describe it.
professor klass, who’d taken david under his wing at penn state university, used to say that if you’re a writer, a dominant emotion fuels your craft. no exceptions. it could be anger or joy. sorrow or lust. like it or not, you’re stuck with it because it’s an integral part of you. the professor compared it to a ferret rooting around in your psyche. elusive. ravenous. and worst of all, unwilling to be found.
