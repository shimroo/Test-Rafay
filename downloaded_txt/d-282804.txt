a fanfare for the new fanfare
by joel flegler, publisher

the first issue of fanfare was printed and published in 1977, and it looked like it
                          had
                          come
                          from someone’s garage. the second issue was done by a professional printer, and when i saw it
                          for
                          the first time, it was the biggest thrill i’ve ever had when seeing a new issue. until,
                          perhaps,
                          the september/october issue.
for almost 50 years fanfare was a hybrid: half magazine, half book. its digest size
                          had
                          reviews
                          and interviews across every page without any divisions, and most of the paper used in every
                          issue
                          except for the last one was non-coated. no more. starting with the september/october issue,
                          the
                          size has been upgraded from 6” x 9” to 8” x 11”, which are the standard specs for most
                          magazines
                          regardless of their content, and every page has been printed on coated (aka gloss) paper. all
                          the
                          texts are divided into three columns, the standard layout for almost all magazines. not only
                          is
                          the magazine more readable, but it’s also more attractive to advertisers, especially with ad
                          rates
                          not increasing in the near future. the content of the september/october issue is identical to
                          what
                          would have been published had it been printed in a digest-size format, including a record
                          number
                          of more than 20 interviews and a memorable group of “music matters” articles, including
                          several
                          devoted to the decline of pop music. 
for a long time many labels have perceived fanfare as “the little engine that
                          couldn’t.”
                          in
                          addition to its smaller layout, it couldn’t compete against gramophone and bbc music
                            magazine with
                          their higher circulations. although fanfare might never have as large a circulation as
                          these other
                          magazines, it should be noted that our readers probably buy more new classical releases per
                          capita
                          than any other publication, and it won’t hurt that the format of each issue now enters the
                          mainstream. 
welcome to the “new” fanfare!
