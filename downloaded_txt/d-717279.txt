explore buffalo’s waterfront



see buffalo like no one else. the west side rowing club offers views of the buffalo waterfront that are difficult to find elsewhere. located off of porter avenue on the west side of buffalo, our location offers stunning views of the city. we are a short, 15 minute row from canal side and the harbor front as well as unity island and the black rock canal in the other direction. our waters are also protected from rough waters by the bird island pier which separates the niagara river from our course. with around 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) of nearly straight rowing, west side offers one of the most competitive and easy to navigate courses in the country.
