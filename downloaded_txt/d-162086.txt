for extra wide or swollen feet
our specially-designed, extra wide footwear caters to swollen feet, with significantly more width, depth, and space than the standard wide-fitting shoes available from other retailers. all our shoes feature the same extra roomy width fitting (6e for women and 3h for men). even if you're unsure of your exact width, most of our styles are adjustable enough to accommodate various foot shapes and levels of swelling. click here to find out more.
