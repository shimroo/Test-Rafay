march; hbic headshots  


i drew some of asoiaf's fierce ladies the other day. now, there are many more kickass girls/women in the series, but these 5 are all povs and hold a significant position of power so i went with 'em. i like how the color scheme worked out and i'm pretty fond of everyone's hair. (character names listed in the da description. no spoilers.)asoiaf ladies in charge by ~lusine on deviantartnow tempted to do a future ladies in charge one (it'd be a giant picture of sansa lolol).i also made a wallpaper with the above picture:( clickity click!collapse )eta: oh yeah, and speaking of, i saw this game of thrones billboard today and only after snapping a picture did i realize that it was at the intersection of sunset blvd. and kings rd. this is beyond awesome to me because the main road running through the continent that (most of) the series takes place in is called the kings road!tags: art, asoiaf/gameofthrones, giant ads, pictures

march; my kingdom for a time-turner  


 f-list cut, with apologies.  i used to always have time for lj but when i got two weeks without properly checking my flist on a regular basis, it's time for a change.tumblr is a better place to follow me if you're looking for fun fandom stuff. and i will happily follow you back there if you link- it takes less time to check than lj.tags: everything should be tagged
