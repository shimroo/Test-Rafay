play with purposeevery game changes the lives of pinellas county youth





golf and givebackmany golfers struggle to balance their love of the sport with life’s demands, but at chi chi rodriguez shot-makers can enjoy our par-69 course and still be home in time for dinner. our golf club is also the home of the chi chi rodriguez academy, a living classroom that provides nontraditional students with hands-on learning. a portion of your golf fee will help give the next generation:the character and values taught through the game of golf. the mentorship and quality education they deserve. the life skills to make our community a better place. play with purpose.
