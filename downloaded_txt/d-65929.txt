welcome










the aids committee of newfoundland and labrador (acnl) is a provincial community-based, non-profit charitable organization committed to preventing the spread of hiv, hepatitis c virus (hcv), and related sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (stbbis) through education and supportive harm reduction-based programs and services. 
what started as a kitchen group providing meals to people in the community, acnl earned its official organization status in 1988. 
almost four decades later, we continue to support people living with, affected by, or at risk for hiv/aids and/or hcv.

the work of acnl programs is guided by five pillars:
1) support2) advocacy3) education4) prevention5) harm reduction
