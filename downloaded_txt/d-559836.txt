i had a chance to meet jaimey on friday. what a pleasure he is. i’m super confident that he guided me in the right direction with some new things to to implement into my daily cleansing regimen. such personality has he, with what appeared to be genuine care. much appreciated, and i can’t wait to see what happens on the14 day challenge that i started on yesterday.thanks again, jaimey for all of your help.
