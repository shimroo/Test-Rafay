customer testimonials










great local welding supply shop! talk to rob cameron, he'll get you set up with whatever you need. prices were a little better than the big national chain, too. i bought my big victor torch setup and large "owner" bottles from these guys, and am real happy with them.
 - josh wetherell






stopped by to exchange acetylene and oxygen cylinders which i've never done before. painless experience thanks to the friendly staff. was out the door with fresh bottles in 5 minutes . reasonable pricing and clean facility as l well. i'll be using them again.
 - joshua hefton






have been shopping here for all my welding needs for many many years.  they have a friendly staff and nearly everything you could need to get your job done right the first time weather your a novice in your back yard, going to school for welding or an experienced person with years under your hood. stop in and see what they can do for you today.
 - gilbert hetrick






i went in here needing some help on my victor torch set because i couldn’t quite get a hose fitting to adapt to my current regulator. they were extremely helpful and took care of my problem in less than three minutes! customer service is very important to me and i was impressed. wouldn’t hesitate to recommend!
 - jacob marr






i have been a customer of the bellingham, wa. central welding store since the early 2000's and have purchased all of my welders there. i recently had an issue with one of my welders and despite the fact that it was over a year out of warranty, jason was able to work with the factory representative and get the machine repaired for what it cost for labor and delivery.  absolutely awesome!  central welding has always been very helpful with any questions that i have or getting me any supplies that i need.
 - mike






very helpful and knowledgeable staff. answered all my questions.
 - danyul bower






i would like to specifically recognize and  thank "aj" at the burlington branch of central welding. his knowledge and customer service is second to none. aj goes above and beyond to make sure we have what we need.
 - kpd pedoclinic






so my boss bought a small flux core welder at harbor freight (if it were my choice, we'd have bought one from central) and i hadn't setup a welder before. i brought it into the the shop and even though i hadn't bought it from central welding supply, they still helped me set it up and get the wire fed through the lead and gun. i truly appreciate that they helped me out today. thank you!!!
 - victoria last






i cant give these guys enough credit. they saw me go from a student to getting my structural cert and getting into my career. this company offers great discounts for students to keep things affordable. they offer great advice and always have great recommendations on tools and consumables. also garth is the man!
 - grant






we have been a customer of central welding for several years now.  today, we called as we needed some nitrous right away.  within an hour, a new delivery man that was new to us named ronay gibson came with what we needed.  he gave us "amazing" customer service.  ronay was quick, efficient, helpful and very courteous!!
 - colby pacific dentistry






top-notch service, on-time delivery, and lower priced than the competition.  7 year customer.
 - wendy crisafulli






thank goodness there is an alternative to airgas in the seattle area. good selection of gases and good prices. they treat you respectfully and fairly even if you don't have an account with them and just need a cylinder or two.
 - andrey g






stopped by for propane fill for my rv. immediately was helped outside and quick and friendly service overall. will be back in the future and recommend everyone to go here for their propane refills. i’m not a welder, however their shop looked well organized and probably have experts ready to help.
 - neil patil






john mason and the rest of the staff were super helpful in helping me select the right kind of gas for my home bar system. john was extremely knowledgeable and was able to suggest different gas types for different types of beer which solved a serious foaming issue i was having. i live ~1.5 hours away and was in town on other business and would 100% make the drive down there again the next time i need gas. thank you so much!
 - william harr






i’ve been working on a few projects recently and the guys at central welding are always there to help with questions and help chose the right products. if they don’t have it in stock, they can order it and it usually gets there in a couple days. they are experienced in fabrication so they offer tips on how the get the job done. don’t be afraid to ask questions because they are very are knowledgeable and helpful to even a noob like me. i appreciate john’s friendly approach to customer service. thanks guys!!
 - the jeepcast






extremely helpful and personable staff at this welding supply shop. i am just a hobbyist with small gmaw and smaw machines and they have been happy to answer all sorts of equipment questions for me. i feel i get the highest level of customer service here even though i don’t spend the big bucks! thank you central welding redmond
 - jack yara






you just don't get this level of service very often. everyone of the staff were so professional, friendly and helpful. i only later found out that the gentleman helping me was karl, the facility manager, who helped me find a solution while at the same time, explaining many of the industry standards and details specific to my company's needs so i could get our equipment up and running. i highly  recommend the excellent people at central welding supply!
 - steve crockett






very nice and helpful people. i had a lot of questions and they answered them so i could understand what i needed and what i was buying without trying to sell me stuff i didn’t want or need. i bought 2 bottles and a regulator, they had them in stock for a very reasonable price. also they are open on the weekends. i will definitely be back. it’s worth the 30 minute drive.
 - haldor dahl






joe and simeon, thank you very much for the best customer service. very friendly helpful guys working there. i'm bringing all my welding needs to you guys now. they have a good variety of everything a welder needs. couldn't find 7018 3/16 rod but they had it and gave me a deal. very happy and thanks for being open on saturday...
 - haik kalashyan






awesome shop. knowledgeable staff. kids took a welding class held by central welding supply. they brought in a number of volunteer instructors who were incredibly knowledgeable and patient. incredibly hands on. thanks roy, adam, jeff and blue.
 - tony cech






whether you need equipment, tanks filled, experienced advice or want to take a class; the guys at central welding supply couldn’t be more helpful. thank you all for making our family feel right at home during your stick class. we will definitely be back!
 - annie moore






i highly recommend central welding supply. they have always been very knowledgeable and helpful. they offer a tig welding class once a month. easy to work with and extremely helpful. they have done all they could to help red barn small engine school. helped us outfit for the kids for the intro to welding classes we offer.
 - jimmy dixon






awesome selection and service. i needed a few random things to get my welder in operation and was pleased with the service. the gentleman was more than accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure i got what i needed.
 - adrien






stopped by to buy a co2 tank, the staff was really helpful, walked me through the different options and helped me confirm the choices i had in mind. i also got a chance to discuss a few of the beginner's questions i had about welding, which were all nicely answered. i'm really happy that i'll be able to buy all the gas i need in this very convenient location!
 - corentin leman






excellent customer service and everything you need in stock. store was organized and clean. friendly help and easy to work with.
 - chris brown






friendly staff. accommodating to a new welder and felt comfortable asking all sorts of questions. i shopped around and this store had the best deals on introductory and professional welding equipment. great for outfitting yourself for the first time.
- katya karankevich






prompt, courteous service as soon as i pulled in to get my tanks filled. georgetown branch was the same way. definitely recommend these guys!
- dustin chesley






this is way overdue! for the last 3 years, central welding, on ne mlk, has been the only place i go to buy my 5-lb co² tanks. and even though they have the best price, what matters most to me is their amazing customer service. they always make me feel appreciated, even though i only come in every couple months. i'd give them 10 stars if could!
- jay fraley






they are great. i exchange 10lb co2 for our home carbonated water system here about every six months. unlike a lot of other supply houses like this, they don't care if you're just a regular joe or a contractor. the pricing is reasonable. i've also always been served very quickly and staff has been friendly.  the tanks have also always been clean looking, although it just sits under our sink so i don't care so much about that. i'd highly recommend them.
- michael sullivan






the fellas down at central welding supply are a huge help. they leave me wanting for nothing. great staff, thorough and top teir service. top shelf products at a fair price. i'll keep going back. i encourage you to check it out.
- arc tech enterprises






friendly staff, knowledgeable and professional. service is always excellent. highly recommend.
- ryan oakley






going to central welding supply is always a pleasure. tood, ken, sarah and bald head jason are always smiling and eager to help, even in the face of issues they resolve it promptly! central weld is and will always be my go to for co2 refills!!!
 - deniz ari
