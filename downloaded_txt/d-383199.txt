searac proudly joins in solidarity with the black community. black history month is a moment to honor and reflect on the relentless advocacy of black activists. it is also a time for action as the new administration continues to attack diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. searac is committed to fighting for the diversity of america. our work is possible because of the black civil rights leaders who believed that equity and justice can be achieved and that a better world is possible. it is our collective responsibility to build that world together. check out searac`s solidarity hub at searac.org/solidarity-hub/ or the link in our bio for resources and ways to continue racial solidarity work in february and beyond.
