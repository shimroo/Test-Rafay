a kansas city tradition



every city has a place where the elite gather for witty conversation over trendy cocktails. in kansas city, that place is definitely not kelly's.














the kelly’s story















from its humble beginnings at the corner of westport road and pennsylvania avenue, kelly’s westport inn has seen it all. pioneer wagon trains filled with families heading west, civil war battles, and super bowl wins. kelly’s is born of history and tradition and we hope you’ll allow us to become a part of your history and traditions.bartender randal kelly’s warm welcomes, quick wit and generous personality helped create a place where people from all walks of life could enjoy a beer or two amongst friends. since 1947, the kelly family has kept the spirit of camaraderie and fellowship alive on this tiny corner of westport.
