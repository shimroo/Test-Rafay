				austinev and ev live            



	        	by aaronchoate in austin related ev news 


gm is starting an effort to highlight its ev live ev education initiative to the public and to its dealers and a few of us from austinev were able to attend their inaugural presentation.  this online platform, which was launched in the summer of 2022, lets you connect over the internet to a live specialist in a real studio in michigan to learn more about the ev ecosystem and ev 101 topics in general.  the studio has many examples of the vehicles and supporting equipment customers may be curious about such as the range of charging stations and a display of the battery pack that shows how it is incorporated into the structure of their vehicle.  the space also allows gm can do remote training for dealers or specialized presentations to groups interested in implementing their emerging e-crate performance ev components.

	        	by aaronchoate in austin related ev news 


aaron was interviewed by the texas standard about the tax credits that were part  of the inflation reduction act.  
you can listen to the segment here:

considering an electric car purchase in 2023? a tax rebate just made that cheaper

since this segment was recorded, the irs issued guidance that the new rules related to battery and materials sourcing will go into effect in march 2023 when they will issue additional guidance on how they will be collecting the data necessary to implement those requirements.  the electric vehicle association policy team is tracking this topic and you can read more from them in ira incentives explained:
