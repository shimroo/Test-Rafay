      <div style="clear:both;"></div>following my <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005433.html">report</a> last friday of finding the standard innateness argument in a 18th-century text by an amateur philologist, i expected my inbox to be overflowing with passages about language acquisition from aristotle, descartes and (in contrast) locke. i had prepared for the onslaught by performing extensive finger-limbering exercises. <br /><br />amazingly, the number of people interested in quoting extensively from the work of ancient philologists out there is considerably smaller than the number of rabid cupertino effect fans, who <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005449.html">cannot be beaten off with sticks or geoff p.'s pointy, pointy words</a>. perhaps understandable. but i did get an interesting email from lameen souag, of <a href="http://lughat.blogspot.com/">jabal al-lughat</a>. an 11th-century arabic scholar, ibn hazm, considered and dismissed the innateness hypothesis before 1064 a.d. as a kind of bonus, in the same passage, he offhandedly alludes to the observation that saussure laid such stress on: linguistic signs are <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005437.html">arbitrary</a>.<br /><br />lameen writes:<br /><blockquote><font color="blue">if you're looking for earlier discussion of the language instinct idea, you could try <a href="http://lughat.blogspot.com/search/label/ibn%20hazm">ibn hazm</a>, d. 1064 - coincidentally, he was also the very unorthodox medieval theologian that the pope rather misleadingly quoted on islam's notion of the relationship between god and ethics in his regensburg address.  in his book al-ihkam fi usul al-ahkam (judgement on the principles of rulings), ibn hazm briefly considers and rejects the idea, essentially saying that language can't be an instinct because if it were surely we would all speak the same language.  i'm afraid the translation below is far from perfect - i'm not too accustomed to reading early medieval arabic - but the idea is pretty clear: <br /><blockquote><font color="green"><br />&#1608;&#1604;&#1605;

but the falsehood of this is plain to the eye, because almost every place has had many languages enter it due to their speakers' involvement and proximity; so this hypothesis is falsified.  also there is nothing in the nature of a place to require that water be called "water" rather than some other combination of letters."</blockquote></font><br /><br />elsewhere in the same chapter, he discusses the common origin of arabic, aramaic, and hebrew.</blockquote></font><br /><br />actually, i don't really want to get a ton of philological email, so if you have additional thoughts on this, you could contribute to the comments section below. if enough accumulate, i'll update with another post on language log.<div style="clear:both;

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>last week, <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~ayoun/">dalila ayoun</a> of the department of french and italian here at the university of arizona, gave a talk in our linguistics colloquium series  in which she dropped a bombshell: native french speakers don't know the genders of french nouns!<br /><br />ok, that's not quite right. it would be more appropriate to  say that native french speakers don't <i>agree</i> on the genders of french nouns. they <i>really</i> don't agree. fifty-six native french speakers, asked to assign the gender of 93 masculine words, uniformly agreed on only 17 of them. asked to assign the gender of 50 feminine words, they uniformly agreed only <i>1</i> of them. some of the words had been anecdotally identified as tricky cases, but  others were plain old common nouns.<br /><br />ayoun didn't set out to test whether native french speakers can accurately identify french nominal gender. her primary research interest is in second-language learning of french. like nearly everyone in the field, and with good reason, she had assumed that native speakers behave fairly uniformly with respect to the grammar of their native language. <br /><br />second language acquisition studies often have a common structure. the experimenter tests people learning the language on a particular linguistic task. usually there are different groups of second language learners — advanced vs. beginning, etc. they all do the task, and the experimenter looks at how many mistakes they make, how long they take to do the task, etc., and draws conclusions about the course of language learning, the efficacy of the teaching technique, or whatever.<br /><br />the experimenter always also gives the task to native speakers, as a kind of control group, to show that when the language has been fully, correctly acquired, speakers perform at or near ceiling — close to 100% right.<br /><br />just to give a typical example, i have student who is looking at second-language acquisition of chinese. she is having her subject perform a task in which they form a sentence containing a relative clause from two independent sentences. (input: <i>john saw a man. the man was tall.</i> correct response: <i>john saw the man who was tall.</i>) in my student's pilot study, she discovered that she might have to reduce the number of sentences in her study, since even fairly advanced second language learners were taking up to an hour and a half to complete the test. in contrast, her native speaker subjects were taking <i>ten minutes</i> to do the same test, with of course 100 per cent accuracy.  this kind of disparity between native speakers and second-language speakers is the norm, rather than the exception.<br /><br />ayoun was investigating second-language learning of grammatical gender in french -- a major difficulty for learners from non-gender languages like english. she had constructed a couple of tasks: grammaticality judgments of sentences where there was a gender agreement mismatch, and a gender-assignment task, where subjects were given a noun and had to choose among "masculine", "feminine",  "both", or "i don't know".<br /><br />in both tasks, to her great surprise, she found a great deal of disagreement among her native-speaker controls! in these tasks, there is always a normatively 'correct' answer—french dictionaries and textbooks all agree on what the genders of nouns are, and how gender agreement in sentences should turn out—in the same way they agree on how to form relative clauses, and how to form passives, and where to put clitic pronouns, and so on. native speakers would be expected to perform close to ceiling on this grammatical task, as on others.  but, surprisingly, they don't.<br /><br />there's an even more interesting twist in ayoun's native-speaker results. her native speakers fell into two groups: 14 adult speakers and 42 teenage speakers. on most grammatical tasks, for all intents and purposes, teenagers' native-language abilities are identical to adults' abilities. but when she broke down the gender-assignment task results by age, she found that teenagers showed considerably more variation than the adults. on the 50 feminine nouns, for example, the 14 adults all agreed on 21 of them, while the 42 teenagers agreed on only one: <i>cible</i>, 'target'. of the 93 masculine nouns, the adults agreed on 51 of them, while all adults and teenagers agreed on only 17 (of 93!!)<br /><br />below i reproduce one of ayoun's tables illustrating significant differences in the rates at which adults and teenagers agreed on the gender of 10 feminine nouns. <br /><br /><img src="http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~hharley/images/blog/femininenouns.gif" width="90%"><br /><br />there are many questions one would like to ask about this, of course, and since ayoun's study was not designed to answer questions about native-speaker variation in gender assignment, answers to most of them will have to await further experimentation. but the result itself seems really remarkable to me. according to ayoun, the last study in which anyone systematically tested native speakers' deployment of grammatical gender in french was tucker et al. (1977)—more than thirty years ago! work to be done.<br /><br />for the interested, some of the second-language speakers' results have already appeared in ayoun (2007). and second language speakers of french, take heart! make your grammatical gender agreement mistakes with confidence. there's a chance that your native-speaker interlocutor will agree with your version!<br /><br /><br />ayoun, d.

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>jerry sadock is here at az giving a short series of talks introducing autolexical syntax to us. he gave an interesting presentation today outlining the structure of the theory. in the q&a, though, he hit one of my sore spots hard enough that i just can't stop myself from a public cry of anger and frustration.<br /><br />he was saying that autolexical syntax (as) has been called a more 'descriptive' framework, but that he finds merit in that compared to more 'theoretical' frameworks such as oh, i don't know, principles and parameters-style work -- us p&p people might have some elegant theory but it's much better to be able to cope with a 'broad range of data', rather than the same tired old 5 examples again and again and again and again. <br /><br />i've been working in a p&p framework for about 18 years now and i've heard that charge levelled at p&p again and again and again and again. perhaps it had some teeth once. it does not anymore.<br /><br />in the course of my still-short career, i have read valuable, often beautiful, p&p dissertations and papers on navajo, ewe, inuktitut, mohawk, warlpiri, bahasa indonesian, malagasy, hindu, kannada, tagalog, zapotec, itelmen, niuean, chichewa, st'at'imcets, passamaquoddy, tsez, kiowa, malay, and nuu-chal-nulth. and if your particular language isn't mentioned in this list, it's not because i necessarily haven't read it or didn't think it was valuable or beautiful; these are just the first twenty less-studied languages that popped into my head as i typed on this particular tired friday night. there's lots more.<br /><br />and of course that's not even touching on the vigorous, thriving research communities that devote serious p&p effort to the major european, middle-eastern and asian languages. <br /><br />and by 'valuable' i don't mean just 'valuable within the context of p&p theory'. essentially *all* of these works described new data, or new patterns in old data, that constitute important contributions to the field in themselves, regardless of framework (though of course they're even more valuable within the context of p&p theory, since they're datasets designed to discover a good p&p account). future analyses of these languages, and of human linguistic ability, will build on these data, generalizations, and analyses, whatever framework they are conducted in.<br /><br />how many kinds of data does a theory have to have worked with in order to qualify as being applicable to a 'broad range of data'?? p&p's track record in this regard is at least as good as any other syntactic approach out there.  <br /><br />there may be good arguments to adopt a different framework; i always like to participate in a good argument. but the discussion should not involve assertions to the effect that the only sentence that p&p theory or minimalists is interested in is "there seems to be a man in the room."<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>like <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005226.html">arnold zwicky</a>, i'm not the kind of linguist who is heavy into antedating and sourcing, but a student and i just recently verified our very own antedation, of <i>eggnog</i>, and it's so seasonal i thought i should share it.<br />the oed's oldest quote for <i>eggnog</i> is from 1825:<p><br /><img src="http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~hharley/images/blog/eggnog.gif" width=90%><p><br />sara kraft, an arizona undergraduate taking a independent study course with me this fall, was reporting to me on a chapter in an anthology of alan walker read's articles on <i>ok</i>.<sup><font color="red">1</font></sup> read had occasion to quote from a 'pastoral' poem written around 1774 by 18th-century clergyman and philologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jonathan_boucher">jonathan boucher</a>, which quote i happened to notice contained the words 'egg-nogg':<br /><blockquote><font color="blue">...<br><br /><i>fog-drams</i> i' th’ morn, or (better still) <i>egg-nogg</i>,<br />at night <i>hot-suppings</i>, and at mid-day, <i>grogg</i>,<br />my palate can regale:<br></font></blockquote><br />i don't know why it occurred to me to check in the oed to see what the earliest source they provided was, but i did, and since it was so much later, and from a british source to boot, i got interested.  we requested an inter-library loan of  boucher's "a glossary of obsolete and provincial words; forming a supplement to the dictionaries of the english language."<sup><font color="red">2</font></sup>  after a false start with an incomplete microfiche from yale, harvard obligingly sent us the actual volume. amazing...<br /><br />the pastoral poem, quite a long one, is a footnote in the 60-page introduction to the glossary.  the full title of the poem, in the verbose convention of the day is "absence: a pastoral: drawn from the life, from the manners, customs and phraseology of planters (or, to speak more pastorally, of the rural swains) inhabiting the banks of the potomac, in maryland".<br /><br />in the introduction to his glossary, (p. xlix), boucher writes the following:<br /><br /><blockquote><font color="blue">"a list of some of the most remarkable and common [words], collected during my residence in virginia and maryland nearly thirty years ago, is here set down at the foot of the page. to this list i will subjoin a copy of verse, which i have ventured to call a pastoral, written during my residence in america; written solely with the view of introducing as many of such words and idioms of speech, then prevalent and common in maryland, as i conceived to be dialectical and peculiar to those parts of america."</font></blockquote><br /><br />the italicized terms in the quoted lines above (lines 69-71) are italicized in the original, and are the 'words and idioms of speech' that boucher considered to be "dialectal and peculiar to those parts of america", including <i>egg-nogg</i>. as read notes, from his reference to ‘nearly thirty years ago’, we can be sure that the pastoral was written around or before 1774, since boucher died in 1804. read notes that he left his maryland parish in 1775, being a loyalist.<br /><br />we wrote of our finding to the oed, and received a nice note back from margot charlton, saying in part:<br /><blockquote><font color="green">i see that the dictionary of american regional english has some interesting eighteenth-century evidence for egg pop, which seems to be similar....the entry goes back to the first edition, and was originally published in 1891; as we revise the text we are finding that we can antedate most entries with the help of the large historical databases now available to us, but it is always<br />helpful to receive such precise information.</font></blockquote><br />boucher is a fairly well-documented fellow, having been rector in george washington's parish, tutor to gw's stepson, and personal friend of gw.  a bit of quick googling on <i>eggnog</i> revealed a startling connection between boucher, washington, and eggnog: apparently a <a href="http://cooking.cdkitchen.com/thecompetentcook/195.html">recipe for eggnog</a> was found among george washington's "kitchen papers" at mount vernon. it doesn't say whether the recipe was titled with the word "egg nog(g)' or not -- the term "egg flip" and (according to dare) "egg pop" were also in use, or maybe it wasn't titled -- but given that boucher noticed marylanders in washington's parish using it, presumably it's likely that washington called it that too. perhaps boucher even sampled some of washington's concoction at a holiday party around this time of year in the early 1770s.<br /><br /><sup><font color="red">1</font></sup>read <i>was</i> the kind of linguist who is heavy into a/s; i learned a lot from that independent study! if you think the recent rash of abbreviationism is purely technology-driven -- email, texting, all these newfangled electronics driving the kidz of today crrrazy -- you should check out his discussion of the mania for abbreviations in 19th-century new england. larry horn describes some of the amazing parallels in detail in <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?a2=ind0206d&l=ads-l&p=17295">this 2002 post</a> to the ads-l listsev.<br /><br /><font color="red"><sup>2</sup></font>the volume we consulted was indeed titled as above, with "obsolete" instead of "archaic", and was from the first (1807) publication of part of boucher's overall glossary. it had been bound together by harvard with another dictionary by nares, dated 1822. the same piece of boucher's glossary, up until 'blade', was published again in 1832, as described in the following excerpt from the "works of the camden society," published by camden society (great britain), royal historical society (great britain) in 1868 (image below from googlebooks):<p><br /><img src="http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~hharley/images/blog/boucherbiblio.gif" width=90%>.<br /><br /><b>update:</b> the far more sophisticated antedaters and sourcers over at ads-l have been hot on the trail of 'eggnog' since this post went up! you can follow the discussion by going <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?s1=ads-l">here</a> and entering 'eggnog' as a search term. the upshot is that a) sara and i were <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?a2=ind0712d&l=ads-l&p=r5696&i=-3">far from the first</a> to spot that boucher used 'eggnog' very early on, and b) there are <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005253.html">several other instances</a> of the word in published sources from the late 1700s (i.e. whose actual date of publication is earlier than that boucher publication date of 1807). <br /><br />so, apologies for wasting everyone's time! but at least it was seasonal. and, as in my independent study, i learned a lot. happy new year everyone --<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
