\"reimagined entertainment\" - las vegas weekly
from the creators of the biggest smash hit shows in las vegas: mindfreak, “o,” and mystère. visionaries criss angel and franco dragone have “reimagined entertainment” in their latest “history-making” production, amystika – a “five-star smash hit!” a beautiful, scary, fantastical, “revolutionary visual and immersive feast,” this theatrical experience will keep you on the edge of your seat amidst tornado winds, a blizzard of snow, and some of the most death-defying acts ever seen. these creative layers bring to life the inspirational story of how a boy named christopher followed his dreams – through his nightmares – and persevered to become criss angel “the greatest magician of all time!” the story, narrated by the voice of criss angel, is one that everyone can relate to – the trials and tribulations of life and how a glimmer of light can see us through our darkest hour and make what appears to be impossible, possible! amystika, “a theatrical phenomenon,” melds the most incredible visual effects and the world’s greatest artists: the jaw-dropping burning man, an unbelievable contortionist, stunning arial vignettes that defy gravity, and revolutionary magic and illusion performances.  killing the audience every night with guaranteed laughs is the “hilarious” comedy magic of mike hammer – a vegas headliner for over a decade! 
so don’t sit back and don’t relax. this is a celebration of life that will inspire and awaken the child in all of us in “the most exciting live show in vegas!” “a masterpiece unlike anything, period!”
