welcome to florida villa owner services (fvos)
we are a full service web design company  providing affordable internet and marketing services to owners of vacation rental properties.  no matter where your vacation property is located - florida, usa or the rest of the world - we can  design a website just for you.
we have been creating websites since 1999, have owned rental properties ourselves, and have all the experience you need.  
mobile-ready responsive websites
  our designs will work beautifully on all desktops, smartphones and mobile devices and are readable without having to "pinch/zoom". 

  the example here shows how the website will "respond" depending on the device used to view them.

as the owner of a vacation rental property you may be contemplating the most effective method of marketing your home to maximize rentals.          
        a presence on the internet is essential for any rental home owner wishing to manage their own bookings. 
         fvos can provide you with a number of internet marketing packages to suit your needs.
        whether it is a new website, a redesign of an existing site, or changes to your current website we can help. 
        for owners who would like to be more "hands-off" and leave bookings to others our "preferred rental program" might be an ideal solution.
