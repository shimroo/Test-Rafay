the national air disaster foundation (nadf) was founded by air crash survivors and victims’ family members to raise the standard of aviation safety, security and survivability, and to support victims’ families. nadf has proven to be an effective voice of reason, and often the conscience in the room promoting short-term and long-range solutions for the highest levels of aviation safety and security, so that others are not harmed.

we extend our solace to the family and friends who have lost loved ones, passengers and crew on mh17 july 2014. the investigation and legal actions continue. 
trials for mh17 disaster continued at the hague, the international court in the netherlands.

the search continues for seven years to locate the aircraft, the important black boxes, and for a proper air crash investigation for the probable cause of mh370.

looking back…looking forward…
when we first met in 1992, 30 years ago, it was a challenge to connect with international air crash family members without the internet, yet october 1992 survivors and family members gathered for the first time in washington dc, and that first annual meeting led to nadf incorporation august 1, 1995. we met challenges then, and we are making significant progress today, while true to our founding goals.
we owe a special thank you to the co3407 family members from the buffalo crash feb 12, 2009, as they passed landmark aviation safety legislation. as a result, there have been no u.s. commercial plane crashes for over 12 years. nadf participated with the rulemaking following the legislation, as nadf membership in faa arac and asac helped support the legislation during the rulemaking process.
nadf is here for the short-term and long-term.
on behalf of our members worldwide,
matt ziemkiewicz, president
