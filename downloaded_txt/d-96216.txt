see jen run! run, jen, run!





i used the treadmill at the gym for the first time today and instead of feeling like a gerbil running on a wheel, i felt fantastic.  so now of course the treadmill is my new favourite thing.  it's this superduper computerized contraption that tells you how fast you're going and how far you've gone and how many calories you're burning and how your investments are doing.  really, it is a technological marvel.  i don't know why i didn't get on the treadmill track sooner. see, i took up running in september, but only because i was seething with anxiety over my job hunt and needed to do something with all that energy. now, i had always hated the thought of running  - all that huffing and puffing and sweating, ick! - and the few times i'd started running, i'd stopped just as quickly because it made me feel so uncomfortable and out of shape.  yes, stopping was the logical thing to do in that case, wasn't it?  kind of like putting off taking my driving test because it will be years before they'll let me drive on the 400-series of highways.anyway, this time around, i decided to give it a serious try and not give up after a week. i started out with short sprints, setting realistic, obtainable goals for myself.  life is all about setting realistic goals, i'm finding.  so on my first runs, in the relative seclusion and privacy of mount pleasant cemetery, where pretty much everybody is dead except for the runners and the baby-joggers and the rollerbladers, i'd run six tombstones, or three mausoleums.  then i was running the lengths of plots, and up hills and through dales and then i finally was brave enough to run in more public places, like the streets.  so i started measuring my progress in half blocks and blocks on long unbroken streets like alcorn avenue and farnham.  and then, just as i started counting my runs in kilometers, it got wicked cold and icy and miserable and i was tired after a long day's libraianing and i took up swimming (indoors) instead.well, the other night, there was a thaw and it was just beautiful outside and i was feeling restless and also painfully aware that my work clothes, which were too loose only a month ago, were uncomfortably tight, so i threw on some jogging pants and a sweat shirt and my running shoes and i ran up a steep hill to the sir winston churchill resevoir.  and then i ran around the reservoir, on st clair and then down spadina road, all the way to casa loma - without stopping.  and seriously, when i got to casa loma, i thought i was going to die or at least throw up and i was sweaty and dishevelled and out of breath.  but in two minutes i had my breath back and i felt great. and i continued to feel great for the next 24 hours.  not only that, but i wanted more.  i'm telling you, this running thing, it's like smack.  no wonder i see all these people running in the ice and snow at five in the morning with their little reflective-tape bum-flaps and their tights and their water bottles. so this morning i got to work early, just so i could run on the treadmill.  fortunately, today i happened to be working the evening shift so by "early" i mean, i got to work at 10.30am.  anyway, so now i'm this big running freak.  who knew?

true christmas confessions





the boston pops arrangement of sleigh ride is, like, one of at my absolute favourite christmas songs.  that cracking whip?  classic.  and the trumpet/horse at the end - could that be any more perfect?  i have never tasted a figgy pudding, nor any kind of nog, egg or otherwise.  and i'm not about to start.when i was little, about four or five years old, i could sing jingle bells, in both official languages (in french, it's vive le vent).  but in the english version, i didn't get the line, "bells on bobtail ring."  i heard and therefore sang,  "bells on cocktail ring".   i didn't know from bobtails, but cocktails?  no problem! give me another shirley temple and make it a double this time.

meli-melo





this is a bit of a catchall post, thus the multiple categories. things are hotting up at work and the upshot of it all is that i have been asked if i want to assume more responsibilities along with more pay.   this didn't come quite out of the blue, but it happened very suddenly, i.e. on friday morning right before lunch. of course i said yes.  duh.  so that's kind of exciting. onward and upward and all that. last night phil and i went to the spit to look at the coyotes.  yes, there are coyotes in toronto, and yes we saw them.  we had to wait almost two hours though.  in fact, we had to decided to leave the spit when we saw them - a family of them, about six in all, three running along the road ahead of us.  it was past twilight and quite dark by this time, so they were a bit hard to make out.  they look like medium-sized dogs.   they have light-coloured fur that's luminous in the dark, and bushy tails.   they were not afraid of us - one sat down about ten feet away from us and watched us as we stood there on the road watching them.  it's a shame it was so dark - i would have loved to take pictures, but the flash would have scared them for sure.      we also heard a northern hawk owl.  it has a ululating call that sounds like a high-pitched, panicked warbling "hoohoohoohoohoohooo!"  we have often heard them when we go camping up north, but last year there was a dip in the northern rodent populations and a lot of northern owls have come south looking for food, so that's my guess as to why this one was so far out of its range.

kenya: "save our beloved country"





this photo is from mental acrobatics.  i don't know if the media is still operating under a blackout, but at least they're working together now to articulate what must be every kenyan's collective wish: "save our beloved country."  read an amazing piece of citizen journalism from mental acrobatics, who braved the empty, boarded up streets to document the planned rally by odinga supporters in nairobi yesterday.
