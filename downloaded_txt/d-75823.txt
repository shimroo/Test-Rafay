what dentrix dentists say . . .













"i remember when my henry schein sales representative promised me that i would get a return on my investment very soon after purchasing my dentrix software. guess what? he was right! funny thing is... i keep getting that same return on my investment month after month...year after year. thank you dentrix!"
– chris hammond, dds, provo, ut


"i can't say enough about what dentrix has done for my practice. it has truly given me the freedom to do dentistry and has given my office manager the best tools available to manage my business. i would recommend dentrix for every practice."
– dr. stephanie l. huddleston, lexington, ky


"dentrix provides the 'wow' factor for my patients to visualize the treatment they need and to allay their fears about the treatment they don't need. i have never had a trust problem with patients but the 'doubters' are easily handled with the visual they get from dentrix."
– dr. dennis kent, lagrange, il


"dentrix mobile is another tool that makes dentrix software such a complete package. there are occasions when i am away from the office and i need to have access to my patient’s information. dentrix mobile does that and more."
– dr.marc wallach, st. louis, mo


"the dentrix practice advisor provides solutions a practice can truly implement to accomplish their goals…it will make a significant difference in the dental practice for dentists, their team and their patients."
– dr. lou shuman, president, the pride institute
