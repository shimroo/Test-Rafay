our cape floral kingdom			is one of six plant kingdoms in the 
			world? 
			this kingdom is the smallest and richest with 70% of the 
		  plants found 
		  here are nowhere else on earth.
		    the cape is also known for huge carpets  of flowers, often stretching to the 
		    horizon, so 
		    people travel here from all over the world to view this amazing sight. 
		    these flowers  can be spotted from cape town to darling, langebaan, 
		    clanwilliam, vanrhynsdorp, nieuwoudtville, hondeklip bay and springbok. 
		    there are many other flower areas  as well. the flower season changes from 
		    place 
		    to place, but generally the best  time is 
		    during august and september.

southern africa is endowed with an incredible 
			diversity in habitats and wildlife. 
			on the southern tip of this 
			region lies the cape floral kingdom which is considered 
			to be second 
			only to the tropical rain forests in the number of species. southern 
			
			africa has the largest number of species (13) of land tortoise and 
			the region 
			is home to no less than 300 mammal, 900 bird, 130 frog, 
			130 snake, 250 lizard, 
			1,500 tree, 24,000 flowering plant and an 
			estimated 80,000 insect species! 

the region 
            boasts viable populations of the fastest (cheetah), 
            tallest (giraffe) 
            and 
            biggest (elephant) 
            of earths land mammals.  



in the western cape we have some 3,440 wine farms, of which 
			460 have 
			cellars 
			and wine-making facilities. south african 
			wines lead the world in 
			production 
			integrity, 
			environmental 
			sustainability and conservation. producer farmers who belong 
			to the 
			bwi have to meet strict criteria set out by the wwf.
