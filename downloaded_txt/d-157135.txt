dan seals is running in 2008





good news!  dan seals, the democratic candidate for u.s. rep for the 10th district of illinois, with whom i volunteered last summer, is challenging incumbent mark kirk again in 2008.  he already has a primary opponent too: jay footlik, an advsier to the 2004 kerry campaign.  i would be wary of anyone who's reaching out to john kerry for campaign advice, as footlik has reportedly done.

terms that annoy me





and now for the annoying term of the day:"power couple"usage: describes a successful and often pretty obnoxious husband and wife team("husband and wife team" is another phrase which i hate)power couple examples that prove this to be true: mary matalin and james carville, lynne and dick cheney, angelina jolie and brad pitt, mei xiang and tian tianthe term's high-intensity tenor is what gets me in particular.  it's another one of those journalistic cliches that's often used in the context of politics or business to lend a snappy, knowing air to a piece.expressions in the power couple family: power lunch, business casual, power nap, heads down, suit up

the line blurs even more





hillary clinton's takeoff on the "sopranos" finale, with special guest bill and special reference to chelsea is just about the blurriest that the line has been drawn between celebrity and politics--at least since ronald reagan got elected into public office.  just watching it, i felt like the clintons were a television family that i had grown up with more than public officials.  the jab at bill's eating habits just puts it over the top.is it bad that,(1) this stunt makes me like hillary a little better?(2) i've started to enjoy the journey song after this and the sopranos finale?yes, i think it is.

boost for journalism school





i'm two years late on unearthing this, but for my purposes, it's okay: the leaders of five of the nation's most prominent journalism programs are joining in a three-year, $6 million effort to try to elevate the standing of journalism in academia and find ways to prepare journalists better.  the unusual collaboration, which has been developing for three years, involves nicholas lemann, dean of the graduate school of journalism at columbia university; orville schell, dean of the graduate school of journalism at the university of california, berkeley; loren ghiglione, dean of the medill school of journalism at northwestern university; geoffrey cowan, dean of the annenberg school for communication at the university of southern california; and alex s. jones, director of the joan shorenstein center on the press, politics and public policy at harvard university.journalism school may be more useful than in the past, according to berekley's dean: while journalists have long debated the value of journalism schools, mr. schell, who did not attend journalism school, said he now thought such institutions were more vital than they might have been in the past. "things have changed substantially since we came up the journalistic food chain," he said. "as news cycles have gotten faster and more bottom-line driven, there has been less inclination and capacity in media outlets to train, mentor and guide upcoming generations." i'll keep posting about my own investigation into journalism school.  my first j-school visit is planned for the weekend of july 27th to medill at northwestern, my alma mater.

for the love of a non-scandal





why oh why are blogs and news outlets implying that barack obama is guilty of something for which there is no evidence?  in the next wave of "air of scandal" reporting that enjoyed such a following during the clinton administration, obama is being unfairly linked to a guy under federal investigation.  wonkette today links to wizbang politics, which does this very thing, quoting a new york times article which itself offers no evidence of wrongdoing on obama's part but makes something out of obama's connection with this guy rezko anyway:mr. obama says he never did any favors for mr. rezko, who raised about $150,000 for his campaigns over the years and was once one of the most powerful men in illinois. there is no sign that mr. obama, who declined to be interviewed for this article, did anything improper.wizbang argues that "this presents a problem for obama" because "[a]nything which clouds his pure-as-the-driven-snow image can damage his campaign, since he doesn't have a resume of experience to tout and depends upon that image."  they are wrong.  rezko only presents a problem for obama if blogs like wizbang decide to talk it up.  obama has been proven guilty of nothing.  it seems, as i have said before, that people love to knock down those who they see as  perfect, or as wizbang puts it "fresh face[d]."  if obama were an unabashed wheeler and dealer, i'm sure he wouldn't be getting this treatment.  george w. bush never did.

how do people afford this city?





in my new and unplanned blog series about how damn expensive life is, i explore d.c.'s cost-of-living and how increasingly unaffordable it is to live here on a non-profit or lower level government-worker's salary. i was reminded of this once again as i searched craigslist for future housing options for the coming year. considering that the once "cheap" and relatively well-located areas of the city like columbia heights are in the process of being uber-gentrified, it appears hope is lost for the automobile-lacking person who wants to live in a d.c. neighborhood that is in walking distance of a grocery store, metro, and a few other commercial establishments that aren't liquor stores or western unions. the low-end of a 3 bedroom in columbia heights now appears to be 2800 per month or 933 per person, usually before utilities are added in.hypothetical: if i'm making $15 per hour at a non-profit working 8 hour days, five days a week, i make 2400 per month, before taxes, or 31.2 k per year. my d.c. income tax alone would be $400 per year plus an additional 6% of the excess income above 10,000, which in my case would be $139 per month. federal income tax is 4,220 plus 25% of the amount over 30,650, which amounts to $4357.50 or 363.13 per month. medicare and social security taxes are 199, by my calculations, so after taxes, i make 1837.87 per month. my health care premium might be around 60 per month (more if i have a "pre-existing condition"), so i'm down to 1777.87 per month. now, subtract my 933 rent and a 50 utility check (add at least 25 more if i have cable), and i am left with 794.87. i have to eat, which we can approximate at around 250 per month and buy work clothes which maybe be around 60 per month. if i'm paying back 250 in student loans per month, i am now down to about 245, some of which i probably want to put into a retirement account (though it won't amount to the 10% of income that is recommended), the rest of which i should put in a cash reserves account. keep in mind that hill staffers often make significantly less than this hypothetical non-profit salary.so the question is, why, in spite of the high cost-of-living and relatively low salary do young, aspiring public servants move to this city after graduation? i guess my reason was that it seemed like the most likely place to get the sort of occupation i've described and to meet other people with the same priorities, but often enough, people like me come to d.c. and get disconcerted that their peers aren't here for these noble reasons but rather to feed their own ambition. members of this group are willing to stick out their financial necks to live in a city whose lackluster city services, absent mid-range dining and shopping scene, and pretty uniform group of professionals (i.e., lawyers and aspiring lawyers) can make it at times a trying place to live. note to my peers: as long as we keep forking over our rent money (and i'm guilty like you), d.c. will continue to be increasingly unaffordable to people like us.this flight from affordability is of course egged on by d.c.'s subscription to the standard mode of urban renewal today: gentrify, gentrify, gentrify. the luxury condos and shopping complex with the likes of a target that have swept through columbia heights within the past year are a clear culprit for the recently increased rents; they're also the culprit for the continued lack of entreprenuerial character that d.c. maintains. increasingly, d.c. has become a city for the very well-off, the young cash-strapped, and the long-time residents who seem to have fairly little say in any of this planning. why i continue to live here, i don't know.

adjustments





one adjustments that i've endured going from collegiate to working stiff is coming to dislike things i used to like.  most notable right now is my palpable aversion to summer.  what used to be the season of freedom and idling is now that of sweating and thirsting on the walk to work.  when i had jobs and internships in chicago between the school years, i started to feel a twitch of irritation at humid days, non-stimulating work assignments, long commutes, and early (for a college student) mornings.  when this all becomes a consistent fact, it is even worse.  mind you, not morale crushing or dire, just a disappointment when recalling the way summer used to be.  especially here in d.c., where summers means a stultifying combination of work attire and ozone warnings, it becomes difficult to look forward to anything about the season ,save its end.  even in chicago where it tends to get humid, lake michigan's unpredictable wind patterns can bring cool days, the kind that relieve you from the 80 and 90-degree days that are accompanied by glaring, cloudless sun that feels like it is an imperturbable spy following wherever you go.  summer is no longer a relief from school either now that i'm working full-time.  it is just another season that blends in with the slow-moving quickness of all of the others in a working person's year.  seasons are no longer about events or milestones but about dressing for the weather.

postcards from utopia





i just returned from san francisco and am still revelling in the beauty of all of its sites.  one thing i thought about while there is how san francisco is one of several municipalities that is sometimes preceded with the jabbing moniker "the peoples' republic of..."  other places i've heard this prefix attached to are alexandria, virginia, the state of massachusetts, and evanston, illinois. the truth is, all of these "peoples' republics "are pretty great places to live.  while none of them are similar to the communist states to which the phrase alludes, the policies that make these places seem more socialist or communist can't be too bad if they are such nice parts of the country to visit and live.  furthermore, a place like san francisco is really a place of thriving entrepreneurialism, not only because it was one of the headquarters to the dot com explosion but also because it has the fewest amount of chain establishments one will find in just about any american city and a bevvy of competing small businesses in their stead.  without further ado, here are some photos from this aforementioned utopia:(photo credit: steph pituc)(photo credit: steph)
