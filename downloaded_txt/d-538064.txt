beautiful, moving sights
and sounds recorded with solar power, in remote villages in the west
bank, jamaica, india, ghana, brazil and tibet.












greenstar builds a solar-powered
            community center that delivers electricity, pure water, health
            and education information, and a wireless internet connection,
            to villages in the developing world.


we record art, music,
photography, legends and storytelling in traditional communities, and
bring these unique, priceless products to global markets. revenues from
this "digital culture" are returned to the village to support their
ongoing, independent development.

speak together: the
            west bank


the first greenstar project
            was in al-kaabneh, a bedouin settlement on the west bank. the
            music and artwork on this website have never been available anywhere
            else, and come from one of the oldest
            cradles of civilization in the middle east.


the village has its own web page,
            to help introduce them to the internet; click
            here to see it. you can also read a comprehensive
            guide to the religion of islam.
