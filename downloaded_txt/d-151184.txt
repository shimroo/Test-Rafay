e.w. scripps school of journalism













 



the e.w. scripps school of journalism is committed to providing an education that emphasizes professional excellence, critical thinking and social responsibility. through a blend of hands-on education, practical experience and intellectual exploration, we teach journalism in a way that it can be applied to many professions and to a rewarding life in a multicultural and fast-changing world. whether it's telling a story, building a brand or engaging in research, we prepare students for their chosen professions now and those they end up in down the road — including jobs that may not even yet exist in our ever-changing media landscape.






















celebrating 100 years of journalism education from a river valley in appalachian ohio to the global stage: one hundred years of hands-on education, practical experience and intellectual exploration.

from 1923 to 2023
