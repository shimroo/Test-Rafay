natural results 



dr. hasson introduced the concept of individually customized surgical scalpels, while dr. wong pioneered the lateral slit technique – enabling us to accurately match the look and flow of your hair for entirely natural-looking results. this technique has been recognised as the single most important breakthrough in hair transplant surgery since the concept of the follicular unit was put into practice. this revolutionary technique is now employed by leading hair restoration clinics around the world.

minimal scarring 



when performing fut procedures, our doctors use the trichophyic closure technique for donor area closure, which greatly minimizes scarring. the lower edge of the donor area is trimmed and beveled, which allows the upper edge to overlap with it. this overlapping results in a more precise closure that allows grafts to grow through the scar. in most cases, the scar is thin, faint and easily hidden even by shorter hairstyles. hasson & wong also offers scar-revision surgery to improve the look of old, more unsightly scars from previous procedures.

megasessions 



our strip excision technique (fut) allows for the most effective processing of extracted hair grafts. our megasession process, which utilizes our large, experienced staff, enables us to transplant over 3000 grafts in a single surgical session. our patients can experience dramatic results without undergoing multiple surgeries spread several months apart.

fut vs fue 



there are two different techniques used extract donor hair for transplantation. fut surgery (follicular unit transplant) involves harvesting a narrow strip of scalp from the patient’s donor area. each follicular unit (or ‘graft’) in the donor strip is then individually excised and transplanted into the recipient site. grafts typically contain 1-4 hairs each. historically, fut has proven to be the most efficient and cost-effective method of performing a hair transplant. fue surgery (follicular unit extraction), on the other hand, involves the extraction of individual grafts directly from the patient’s donor area without first harvesting the skin. at hasson & wong, the results of fue surgery are comparable to those of fut – with the added benefit of minimal scarring.
