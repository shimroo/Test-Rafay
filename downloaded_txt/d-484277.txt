roots and wings: our path to purpose is here!

last year, roots and wings centered on "our authentic selves," highlighting identity, joyful learning, and celebrating the unique gifts everyone brings to echo horizon. this year’s theme, “our path to purpose,” builds on that journey, exploring how we use our gifts to benefit others. through the stories in this issue, discover how our students, faculty, and community members have created a caring and empathetic environment where everyone can thrive.

embracing “hygge” to foster happiness, belonging, and wellbeing at echo horizon

in her latest blog, head of school, peggy procter reflects on how we’re incorporating the danish concept of hygge—coziness, connection, and community—into daily life at echo horizon school. as we begin our centennial year, it’s the perfect time to deepen those connections and welcome new faces into our fold. check out the blog for more on how hygge is helping us build a stronger, more inclusive community!

 echoing knowledge: a teacher's journey of lifelong learning

with the continuous support of the echo horizon community, educators are able to nurture their journey of lifelong learning and bring our students an innovative and engaging educational experience. we sat down with franqui messinger, our dedicated kindergarten teacher, to delve into her recent master's degree and the impact it has brought to her classroom.
