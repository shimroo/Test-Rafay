while waiting for shing to do finish her photo thingy, i think i should say something about my blog... ok as you can see, this place is dead!!! worse than a cemetry or anything. i decided to change my blog to sakiya.vox.comi haven started blogging there and i will still continue to blog here till i have settle the stuff there. changing because blogger sucks too much and nothing else... dont think too much.feel sad to abandon a blog which i had posted like 415 posts over here?? of course i will never delete this blog as i do not wish to lose any memories about my past....life is really sucking... esp with you in my life. dont know whats wrong with you and you **** thingy but i think it is amusing to hear the news like 10 days later??? wtf??? now just wish to concentrate on my o level and of course forming of my band!!!! anyone interested??? hehe^^wish good luck to everyone... and all i can say is that i had grown... my thinking is more mature and i know how to be myself. the real me. the real me that i always wanted to be... and i hope i can be myself forever and not lost in the middle of nowhere.really love old jrock band!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! esp those half pop and rock like luna sea and janne da arc!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! new bands that i love are sid and orange range!!!! half rock and pop!!!! the best mixture on earth!!!! hahahah!!!!ok you are angry and whatever i know.... congrats to you although you rejected it and wish you are happy!! :)

i just realise how much i love my family. a mum who alsways scold me but the greatest person on eath, not even sugi can beat her. (not as in beat her up hor) my dad who slog all day to earn money for the family. (wei da leh) my sis who love me alot but not as much as she love wu zun (sad man)going to visit my grandma who is in the hospital again. thursday we send her to the hospital cause my aunt says she looks really very weak and she lost like 3 kg. from 52 to 49. like sugi weight lor. but i think sugi is 45. anyway, they say her brain is functioning very slowly nowadays cause she cant remember who sent her to the hospital already and dont remember the ranking of her own children, let alone her grandchildren. i think she might only remember my sis cause my grandma really love my sis. but i doubt she will remember me much cause i dont even like talk to her. not that i dont want, is i dont know how. sad really. sad!going to chalet after visiting her. meeting ky, kat and sarah at pp. so ma fan man... haiz. hope i can really enjoy myself today!!!!had been listening to sid for like consecutive 3 days. i am now still not sick of them. the feeling is just like the time whereby i kept on listening to ls for weeks and months and i dont get sick... this is how much i love the band sid, mao's voice and the music aki compose. really pity that not much people in singapore are actually their fans. but luckily hara is!!!!!!!!!!!!! and she loves aki as much as i do... but i think she loves mana more. we even say about sharing aki where she take the bottom while i take the top :pnothing to blog le... and yes i am sure that i failed both my science test. my chinese test sucks to the core and for focus test i dont have much confident also.... i sucks so much. seriously i sucks!!! argh...just cut my hair... and it can stand up without wax or hair spray. i save quite alot of money from the wax and stuff.... haiz sian ar!!!! dont feel like cutting aki or sugi's hair because in school like so wierd...satsuki send me a video of hizaki grace project (something like that) video. they all dressed up in gothic and lolita and my sis saw it! she keot on asking is one girl or guy, i say is all guy!!!! haiz, howcome people always like to ask jrockers are female or male? but i dont really like gothic rock band except malice mizer and some phantas.... haizaikagi, binetsu, hosoikoeand junkanby sid are pretty nice.... alot other songs are nice too but i forgot their name le :p ( all ls and sid songs are nice!!!!) heheehehe....ja mata ne...

ok now i am so not sure if i am angry or sad. i am now landed into this deep shit whereby my friends might think that i am breaking a promise or something. because of you, i lied to them about the stuff and they seems to like hate me? i cant even say that they are my friends now cause we just knew each other and we are now in this state. mf man.i dont know what happen between us or it might just be that we have nothing in common to talk about and so we are so cold towards each other. now i am sure that i will stay away from you, as far as possible so that i will not be hurt. i tell you this feeling sucks! sucks to the core!i feel like crying out loud. i feel like screaming out all my thoughts and feeling right into your face or something like that.... the only thing that make me feel better from all the suffering is the music of sid and the amazing voice of mao. listening to their songs is really a great pleasure and i finally can let it go.my heart aches so much... hated this so much!!!!!!!!!!! i want mao!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i want aki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i want sugi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but i dont want you!!!!!! never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!going for chalet tomorrow so i decided to play the heart content and forget about you!!!! looking forward to see everyone esp sam, ming shun, sisters and alot other people, people who can make me laugh, make me be myself. i look forward to see you all.sayonara by orange range so not healing my wound.shedding tears... ... dripping blood... ...
