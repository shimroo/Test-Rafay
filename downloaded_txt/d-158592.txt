ladislav bittman / czech defector - ai article produced 





 ladislav bittman was a former czechoslovak intelligence officer who specialized in disinformation and propaganda. he was the architect of a notorious operation known as operation neptune, which aimed to smear public figures in west germany by planting forged nazi documents in a lake in czechoslovakia and then “discovering” them1. one of the targets of this operation was franz josef strauss, the leader of the christian social union and a candidate for chancellor in 19652.bittman also claimed that he was involved in another operation to spread false information about the role of the cia in the 1964 coup in brazil. he said that he forged documents that suggested that the cia had supported and financed the overthrow of president joão goulart, and that he distributed them to brazilian journalists who were on the payroll of the czechoslovak intelligence service3. he said that this operation was part of a larger campaign to undermine the credibility and influence of the united states in latin america3.bittman defected to the united states in 1968, after the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia. he changed his name to lawrence martin-bittman and became a professor of disinformation at boston university. he wrote several books and articles exposing the soviet and czechoslovak disinformation tactics and warning about their dangers to democracy1. he died in 2018 at the age of 871.if you want to learn more about bittman and his operations, you can check out the following sources:cold war disinformation: new revelations about operation neptune from czech archives: this is a blog post by calder walton, who interviewed bittman shortly before his death and accessed the czech archives that reveal the details of operation neptune.lawrence martin-bittman - wikipedia: this is a wikipedia article that provides a biography of bittman and his career as an intelligence officer and a defector.ladislav bittman – wikipédia, a enciclopédia livre: this is a wikipedia article in portuguese that mentions bittman’s role in spreading disinformation about the cia’s involvement in the 1964 coup in brazil.

artificial intelligence article on anatolyi golytsin " new lies for old" book 





 anatolyi golytsin was a former kgb officer who defected to the west in 1961. he wrote a book called new lies for old in 1984, in which he exposed the soviet strategy of deception and disinformation against the western world1. he claimed that the soviet union was planning a long-term scheme of pretending to reform and liberalize, while secretly preparing for a surprise attack and world domination2. he predicted some of the events that happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as the collapse of the berlin wall, the end of the cold war, and the rise of gorbachev1.golytsin’s book was controversial and met with skepticism by many western analysts and officials. some of his critics accused him of being paranoid, delusional, or a disinformation agent himself1. however, some of his supporters, such as former cia counterintelligence chief james angleton, praised him for his courage, insight, and accuracy3. angleton wrote a review of golytsin’s book, in which he endorsed his analysis and warned about the dangers of soviet deception3.golytsin’s book is still relevant today, as it provides a historical perspective on the soviet tactics and goals, and raises questions about the current state of russia and its relations with the west. you can read more about golytsin and his book from the following sources:new lies for old: the communist strategy of deception and disinformation: this is the full text of golytsin’s book, available online for free.new lies for old: the communist strategy of deception and disinformation: this is a google books preview of golytsin’s book, with some additional information and reviews.new lies for old : the communist strategy of deception and disinformation: this is another online version of golytsin’s book, with a different format and cover.anatoliy golitsyn’s first book, ‘new lies for old’, caused a running sensation when it was discovered that, unlike most western analysts, the author had accurately predicted some years ahead of the events, the ‘break with the past’ which took place in eastern europe and the soviet union in 1989-91: this is a pdf file of a book by christopher story, called the perestroika deception, which builds on golytsin’s analysis and provides more evidence and arguments for his thesis.anatoliy golitsyn - wikipedia: this is a wikipedia article about golytsin’s life, career, and views.doc is review by james angleton of ‘new lies for old’ by anatoli golitsyn: this is a cia document that contains angleton’s review of golytsin’s book, along with some comments and notes.
