						"brian goes above and beyond. although he didn’t have any jobs in my area that he was contracted with, he was still willing to help me. he truly cares about what he does and makes a difference. thank you for making the job hunting process easier."					


vanessa p. 






						"i can’t speak highly enough about brian. he is truly someone that cares about the success of others. he takes time to guide, coach, and direct without hesitation. brian is a rare gem in the vast world of recruitment!"					


april marie m.  






						i have had the great pleasure of working with brian during my journey of finding a new organization to join. today, the industry of recruiting has changed, drastically. from many different aspects, for example. staying in communication with candidates, staying in communication with the employer, and quite frankly shear professionalism. brian has never wavered here. his communication, honesty, and good intentions and heart are what sets him apart. i’ve also worked with brian from the employer side. his listening skills are impeccable, and his searches for the right person are relentless. i’ve always appreciated his “quality vs quantity” approach. i would highly recommend working with brian, both as a candidate and employer. 					


ty l. 






						"brian stewart is one of the best recruiters in the pharma/biotech space. he is great at communication, preparation, and follow up, and has been instrumental to me at various stages of my career. i highly recommend brian for any recruiting opportunities and roles you wish to fill. his database and network is second to none!"
