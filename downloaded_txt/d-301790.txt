our purpose
 
as disciples of christ





“so christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ.”

— ephesians 4:11-13 niv



as god’s people (his church) we are called to demonstrate the full expression of who christ is in all areas of life. practically, this starts with a commitment to personal change, and it’s much more than just sunday meetings – it affects how we build all aspects of life together as a community and how we serve others.we build life through our local base in coventry and as part of a global network of churches and other kingdom initiatives.
