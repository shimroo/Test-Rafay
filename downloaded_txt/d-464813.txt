		voices and contrasting guitar styles makes for a gentle and relaxed 
		sound.be sure to 
		check out the cause on the songs page

      notes of thanks





       



 suzy q,

      your suggestions, pics, and sound clips have

      been the meat of this site.  without you, this

      site would be sooooo boring.
 


sabine,

      without your generous time in assisting me

      to brainstorm and test this site, i am afraid

      it would be nothing more than

      a bunch of text that leads to no where.











note to other

      webmistresses/masters












to potential ebay vendors

    
these videos are free for

    the download.  they are not meant to be burned onto cd and sold

    on ebay!  this is fair warning to you.  i am a member of ebay's

    vero (thanks juliet and suzanne

    for the info) and i will not hesitate to use it.  to take advantage of

    fellow ar fans (and friends) is a big no-no!

      to screen caps and sounds--and lucky for us  she loves sharing!

      a piece of work he has done.  whether it be a novel, 

      screenplay, a book with his name it it, ali-pat

      can tell you where to find it.
