frequently asked questions


do you go by appointments?


while we do handle most pet visits by appointment, we are able to accept emergency or urgent visits during business hours.
should you experience an emergency with your pet, we ask that you call us ahead to let us know that you are coming so that we can prepare for your arrival. this allows us to provide timely care for your pet when minutes matter, and also to make sure that we are able to accomodate for clients with appointments.
