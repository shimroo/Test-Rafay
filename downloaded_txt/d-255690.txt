jesus
christ the same

have for you, says the lord.
they
are plans for good and not for evil,
to
give you a future and a hope.

am the resurrection and the life:
he
that believeth in me,
though
he were dead, yet shall he live:
and
whosoever liveth
and
believeth in me shall never die.
believeth
thou this?
(john
12:25-26)
