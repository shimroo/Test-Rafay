                                        first time using their service, and everything from ordering, updating of the status to delivering, it was professionally done. their website was easy to follow, pricing and costs were reasonable and clearly stated.  i was pleasantly surprised to receive an email of the finished product before it’s out to be delivered.  those special touches make this experience more enjoyable.  will definitely enlist in their service again.

                                        i am impressed that they were able to take an order for next-day delivery on valentine's  day weekend. delivery was as promised. flowers beautiful, and the arrangement was bigger than expected. card was also large and nicely done.

                                        they were fantastic! they filled in a last minuted order. when the recipient wasn't home, they called me to make sure it was okay to deliver or if i wanted them to try the next day. after i told them to leave it, they offered to replace any wilted flowers if need be, if they were left out too long by the recipient. thankfully, that wasn't needed. the flowers and penmanship on the card were great. flowers looked like the image on the website. thank you so much!
