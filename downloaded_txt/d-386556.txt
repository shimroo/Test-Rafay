hello, welcome and happy new year!!!so the new year is here.  i can't believe that christmas is over.  it was a crazy holiday season here.  hubby was sick for almost his whole holiday break, i felt so bad for him.i did get a bunch of crafting done for the holidays and beyond.  let me share with you.this one is a ceramic tile that i added the merry christmas in vinyl.this is an acrylic ornament that i added the vinyl saying and cardinal to.this one is a black disc ornament that i added the santa cam vinyl to.i have added the cardinal ornament on my kreations page, so if you'd like to purchase one, please stop by.i also added another album that i was able to make and will have one more once i take picture of it!  i have so much fun making these albums, but to take pictures can sometimes be challenging since they are so big when opened.  but i will try my best.here's the latest album i have made:thanks so much for stopping by and i wish you all the happiness and joy for the new year!take care and hope to see you soon. if you'd like to follow me...   i hope you enjoyed these creations...and as always with all of the pictures on my blog...you can always click on the pictures for bigger, detailed pictures.also...i would love to know if there is anything you would like to see on my blog.  let me know if there is a specific item you would like to see used, or a theme...or any suggestions you may have about what you have seen.i would love any feedback you may have whatsoever, just comment below.i'd love to hear from you!!!thank you so much for visiting and take care!!!
