                                                    practice for the last 30 years. 
                                                    his results have been so influential, 
                                                    that he plans on continuing 
                                                    to utilize these methods and 
                                                    enhancing them for as long 
                                                    as he practices. therefore,

                                                    learning from a credible, 
                                                    first-hand source that will 
                                                    introduce you to real, scientific, 
                                                    clinical experiences. unfortunately, 
                                                    often you find methods out 
                                                    there that are not scientifically 
                                                    proven, by people who do not 
                                                    actually utilize or believe 
                                                    in their methods. this proudly 
                                                    is not the case.
