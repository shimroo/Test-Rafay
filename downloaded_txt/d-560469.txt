 best inn on the jersey shore!!i am from nj, but not familiar with the shore. i knew i was looking for something fabulous, and i found it. the chateau is decadent!! i was so impressed with everything!! the entrance and foyer have beautiful sitting areas to enjoy wine or iced tea or coffee. and the rooms are beautiful!! clean and spotless! towels are soft and don’t reek of bleach! the staff are wonderfully friendly. i truly can’t wait to return!!

 enchanting innbeen coming here for years and never disappoints. the staff are wonderful and very accommodating. there’s an old world charm: fireplaces in many rooms, but with modern amenities like huge soaking tubs. it is totally unique among all other options and i highly recommend this gem of a hotel.

 the goat guest house hotel in spring lake!everything about this boutique hotel is magical. from first class service to beautifully appointed rooms, there is a low-key impeccability about the chateau. convenient to shops, restaurants, the beach and overlooking spring lake park, the setting is as wonderful as the cozy fireplaces in the rooms and the elegant pristine furnishings throughout the hotel. it's our best kept secret in spring lake and am only afraid the secret is now out!
