oops...overseers of nuclear weapons fired.


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     




officials were given hours to fire hundreds of employees, and workers were shut out of email as termination notices arrived. the terminations were part of a broader group of dismissals at the department of energy, where reportedly more than a thousand federal workers were terminated. it was all a result of elon musk's department of government efficiency (doge) initiative to slash the federal workforce and what musk and president trump characterize as excessive government spending.
...
on thursday, officials were told that the vast majority of the exemptions they had asked for were denied by the trump administration.
...
on friday, an employee still at nnsa told npr that the firings are now "paused," in part because of the chaotic way in which they unfolded. another employee had been contacted and told that their termination had been "rescinded." but some worried the damage had already been done. nuclear security is highly specialized, high-pressure work, but it's not particularly well paid, one employee told npr. given what's unfolded over the past 24 hours, "why would anybody want to take these jobs?" they asked.
nnsa held an all-staff meeting friday morning, announcing the doe had agreed to pause the layoffs, due to the agency's national security mission.
it gets better and better.

with apologies to elton john


		   by: mark harmon
		   
	     



elon wears his trump cap like a crown
he calls his child lil x
'cause he likes the name
and he takes him to the strangest room in town
elon, elon likes his money
he makes a lot, they say
spends his days counting
burning cars on the motorway
chorus
he was born a to wealthy white family
when the new york times said, "god is dead
and the war's begun"
oh, the musks have a son today
and he shall be elon
and he shall be a bad man
and he shall be elon
in tradition with the emerald man
and he shall be elon
and he shall be a doge man
he shall be elon
elon has cartoon goons in tow
his car business slides
elon blows up rockets all day
sits on the porch swing watching them die
and elon, he wants to go to mars
leave us all far behind
take a rocket and go soaring
while we all, we all slowly die
chorus repeats

14 states sue over musk's unconstitutional power 


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     



fourteen states have filed a federal lawsuit against president donald trump and elon musk, challenging musk's role as head of the new department of government efficiency and accusing him of being a "designated agent of chaos" whose "sweeping authority" is in violation of the u.s. constitution.
"there is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual," says the lawsuit, filed by new mexico attorney general raul torrez and officials from arizona, michigan, maryland, minnesota, california, nevada, vermont, connecticut, rhode island, massachusetts, oregon, washington and hawaii. "although our constitutional system was designed to prevent the abuses of an 18th century monarch, the instruments of unchecked power are no less dangerous in the hands of a 21st century tech baron." two of the 14 states are led by republican governors.

this is a separate lawsuit from the one 19 state attorney generals sued over treasury data on 2/8/2025.
this is also separate from the lawsuit filed by 22 states over cuts medical research funding (nih).
once again, be thankful there are some states, groups, organizations and individuals willing and able to stand up to these oligarchs.

from al.com, al.abama media.
jd crowe: elon musk promotes trump to ‘toddler'.
a white house press conference turned into a battle for attention between president musk’s 4-year-old son and a befuddled elderly guy trying to nap in the oval office.
then there's rick bragg. i miss p.j. o'rourke.

trump administration taking back $100 from 250 alabama residents 


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     



earlier today i asked, "can the president take back our federal deposits?"
the answer is, yes.
about 250 huntsville utilities customers were in for a surprise when they received letters notifying them their accounts were about to be debited $100 to take care of their electric bills.
...
that’s because the assistance they were receiving through grants..., were revoked following an executive order from president donald trump.

can the president take back our federal deposits?


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     




millions of people in the u.s. receive direct funding from the federal government. is it now the norm for the current administration to randomly take back funding that has already been deposited in our bank accounts?
that is what the current administration did to new york city. they were distributed $80 million in congressionally-appropriated fema funds. the money was in the bank account of new york city.
then, the current administration went to the bank and took back the congressionally-appropriated fema funds. they went to a bank and took money out of a bank account that was not theirs. new york city did not approve of this withdrawal. congress did not approve of this withdrawal. if they can do this to new york city, imagine what they can do to you, an individual.

gay street bridge will never reopen to vehicular traffic


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     



mayor indya kincannon said that because of more than 120 years of wear and tear, the gay street bridge will never be able to return to the level of traffic that it was being used for previously.
it is expected the bridge will be reopened to pedestrian and bike traffic, and may be open to emergency vehicle use in the future, although more information is needed.
...
jason brady from gresham smith said the plan is for the city to work to replace the bridge in the next five to 10 years.

wow!  a bit of an inconvenience i'd say.

22 states sue over medical research funding (nih)


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     




a coalition of 22 attorneys general sued the federal government, claiming that the $4 billion in cuts would “grind to a halt” studies on cancer, heart disease and other conditions.

this is a separate lawsuit from the one 19 state attorney generals sued over treasury data.
a federal judge on monday temporarily blocked the national institutes of health from cutting research funding in 22 states that filed suit earlier in the day
thus, tennessee and every other southeastern state, except north carolina,  are still prevented from receiving national institutes of health research funding.
"in addition to massachusetts, arizona, california, connecticut, colorado, delaware, hawaii, illinois, maine, maryland, , michigan, minnesota, nevada, new jersey, new mexico, new york, north carolina, oregon, rhode island, vermont, washington and wisconsin are a part of the lawsuit."
again, be thankful there are some states, groups, organizations and individuals willing and able to stand up to these oligarchs.

standard knitting mills development redux


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     



again, "new life ahead for standard knitting mill."
"...the new baseball stadium is sparking growth in the underdeveloped east side of knoxville, creating opportunities for housing, businesses and community engagement.
“the redevelopment at the mill site will transform it into a mixed-use destination featuring residential lofts, boutique retail, dining and office spaces” – all within walking distance of the new stadium."
i love how sandra adds the historic information about the site. quite fascinating. 3,000 employees, 3 shifts, making t-shirts and underwear. "built in 1900, the standard knitting mill was once the largest textile mill of its kind, producing millions of garments annually and earning knoxville the title ‘underwear capital of the world."
from five years ago,
* knoxville standard knitting mill site to be turned into mixed-use development
* standard knitting mill proposal

what's at stake for consumers as trump officials target the cfpb


		   by: jbr
		   
	     



one of the agency’s biggest recent wins over industry players has been limiting overdraft or insufficient funds fees. after years of cfpb scrutiny of these surcharges, many banks started dropping the fees on their own. in fact, the revenue banks derived from overdraft fees dropped more than $6 billion between 2019 and 2023. that agency push culminated in a final rule in december that would have capped overdraft fees at large banks to $5, but its fate is now uncertain.

tech wants to plug directly into power plants


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     




...tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.
it’s raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it’s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly.
right now we may not have any federal regulators. either way, we may be in trouble if tech companies control the power grid.

trump dismisses head of the national archives


		   by: jbr
		   
	     



trump said in an interview with radio host hugh hewitt last month that he intended to fire shogan, saying: “we will have a new archivist.”
the national archives played a key role in the criminal case against trump, alerting the justice department in 2022 that trump had potentially mishandled classified documents after the president failed to return records that the agency had requested, something presidents are required to do after departing office.

rep. barnyard tim after the utk furries?


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     




sandra clark said a year and a half ago,
"so why has east tennessee elected a man who holds hearings on bigfoot and ufos, wears barnyard clothes to stand out and hangs with the loony fringe?"
it's gets better...
in a now deleted facebook post,
"tennessee rep. tim burchett has inquired with university of tennessee system president randy boyd about a “furry club” at the university’s knoxville campus."
...
“the fact that ⁦the university of tennessee even has a furry club is alarming. this isn’t the university of tennessee that i know. let’s leave that for the university of texas,” burchett wrote in the post."
however, he's not concerned that...

...the u.s. military academy at west point ordering a dozen extracurricular and social clubs centered on gender, race and ethnicity to immediately “cease all activities.” some of the clubs affected included the society of women engineers and the national society of black engineers club.

trump: u.s. takeover of gaza strip, "riviera of the middle east"


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     



february 5, 2025, updated 2:14 pm.
"the u.s. will take over the gaza strip," trump said in a white house press conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. "we'll own it ... we have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal ... the riviera of the middle east."
february 5, 2025, updated 10:20pm
trump aides defend gaza takeover proposal but walk back some elements.
"at a white house briefing on wednesday, press secretary karoline leavitt hailed his gaza proposal as historic "outside of the box" thinking but stressed that the president had not committed to putting "boots on the ground" in the territory. she declined, however, to rule out the use of u.s. troops there.
at the same time, leavitt walked back trump's earlier assertion that gazans needed to be permanently resettled in neighboring countries, saying instead that they should be "temporarily relocated" for the rebuilding process."
february 6, 2025, 5:32am

where all of those college student protesters now? are they not concerned about the palestinians getting kicked out of their country? they hurt harris in the 2024 election. are they afraid of trump? were they organized just to hurt harris?

19 (was 13) states to sue over treasury data breach


		   by: bizgrrl
		   
	     



the treasury department has given elon musk and representatives of his department of government efficiency (doge) team access to the vast federal payment system responsible for handling trillions of dollars in government expenditures...
now...
thirteen attorneys general, including new york’s letitia james, said in a statement that they were taking action “in defense of our constitution, our right to privacy, and the essential funding that individuals and communities nationwide are counting on.”
“as the richest man in the world, elon musk is not used to being told ‘no,’ but in our country, no one is above the law,” the statement said. “the president does not have the power to give away our private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by congress.”
joining [letitia] james [new york attorney general] in the statement were the attorneys general of arizona, california, colorado, connecticut, delaware, maine, maryland, minnesota, nevada, new jersey, rhode island and vermont.
update: the state attorney generals filed the lawsuit friday, 2/8/2025. now, 19 states are on the lawsuit.
in addition to new york, also on the lawsuit are arizona, california, colorado, connecticut, delaware, hawaii, illinois, maine, maryland, massachusetts, minnesota, nevada, new jersey, north carolina, oregon, rhode island, vermont, and wisconsin.
hawaii, illinois, massachusetts, north carolina, oregon, and wisconsin were added to the lawsuit after my initial post at 6:51 am this morning.
thankfully there are some areas in this country with a belief in our constitution and our rights.
