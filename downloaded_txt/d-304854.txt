our service
most of the properties offered are obtained through estate liquidations, bank owned property sales, foreclosures, auctions, and abandoned farms.
we search for land buying opportunities across the country concentrating mainly on states showing significant growth and favorable tax climates or properties that are extreme value plays in popular locations.
lake properties and large acreage tracts are the primary offerings in most cases.
of course, certainty and peace of mind are paramount for land buyers. each property comes with a warranty deed and a new survey as well as a host of other guarantees and approvals  specific to the properties offered.  everything is prepared with professional diligence and disclosed to the buyer in the process of buying.



our standards
the standards we use to assess properties:
 price/value– we look for properties that are below market prices for comparable land.
location– we look for properties in the path of growth or in popular destination spots with high demand.
quality– the properties must be extremely high quality, something you’d want to put a dream home on or hand down generationally.







below are the states in which we see the most opportunity.

each section has a link to the properties available in those states.







western land & ranches(arizona & nevada)
arizona and nevada are wildly popular places to live, work and play these days. communities are filling as fast as they are built in these markets.
despite the rapidly climbing real estate prices we have found some exceptional value in an area we refer to as “the golden spur of the west”. this area is central to some of the biggest and best attractions in the west: las vegas, the grand canyon, hoover dam, lake havasu, flagstaff and sedona. the list goes on…
large acreage ranch land and large acreage rv property outside of major destination spots is where we see the best opportunity.

mountain view ranches(colorado)
colorado is one of the top states in the us to live in or own a second home.  its diverse landscape is astoundingly beautiful, the cities are clean and stylish, the economy is thriving and business friendly. what’s not to love about colorado?
because it is so popular and it’s growth so robust, it can be difficult to find real estate bargains in this state. the offerings we present here are remarkable opportunities in regard to both  price and quality. we offer large acreage properties at amazing prices in the path of growth just outside of major metro areas.
take a look at our current offerings.

florida land sales(florida)
florida has just about everything everyone wants in one state: warm winter weather,  endless stretches of sandy coastline and crystal clear waterways, and  truly amazing natural wonders. it has incredible amusement parks , sporting events and top universities.  florida is pro-business, in terms of taxation and regulation. the economy is experiencing robust growth. not coincidentally, it is also a 0% state income tax state.
it is becoming exceedingly difficult to find big tracts of land and value priced lake property in florida these days.
offerings in this market are typically sold off in a matter of hours once they hit the market.

new york land & lakes(new york)
in the northeast us we have found a “sweet spot” for value investors in upstate new york. in the area between the southern adirondacks and the catskills, arguably the most beautiful countryside in the northeast, we have found some of the best prices per acre for large acreage east of the mississippi. this is surprising considering some of the largest concentrations of population, wealth and elevated real estate prices are just a couple of hours away in the ny/nj metro area. though buying opportunities have become more scarce in this region over the last few years, there still remain some great finds if you know where to look.

tennessee land & lakes(tennessee)
tennessee is one of the top states in the country to relocate to. it could have something to do with its dramatic mountains, lush green hills, and sparkling waterways. it could be the cultural draws:  music, art, historical sites and universities. maybe it’s the temperate 4 season climate and its central location, a day’s drive to most major cities in the us, or the friendly people.
indeed, all these things are contributing factors, but perhaps the most important driver of all is financial. people and commerce are coming to tennessee because money goes much further in this low property tax and 0 % income tax state. this goes directly to the quality of life of its residents, and you can feel it everywhere you go in tennessee.

texas land & lakes(texas)
people from all over the map are heading to the wide-open spaces and inspiring landscapes of texas.  it’s a major growth story. in fact, cities in texas are growing faster than anywhere in the us. this is another 0% income tax state. the business environment is extremely favorable and good for those preserving wealth in retirement.
lake property and large acreage tracts of land outside of the dallas metro area are becoming scarce and prices are increasing rapidly. we see huge opportunity in this closing frontier.

“the best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. the second best time is now.” the same principle applies to buying land.

beauty, above any other consideration, is the most important factor when we are considering developing a property.  we will simply pass on a property if it doesn’t move us emotionally when we look at it for the first time. you can see from the gallery pictures below; our standards are exceedingly high.
