proudly, defiantly made in the usa
pit bull is not only made in the usa...  it's made better in the usa.  we never compromise quality and do not cut motorcycle stands into four pieces so they can cross the ocean for less.  ask anyone who has owned any motorcycle stands for a length of time...  when you want the best, buy pit bull!


innovative motorcycle stands and more!
 pit bull has been innovating in the motorcycle industry for 30 years.  height adjustable motorcycle stands?  we've been doing that for over 20 years now.  increased leverage via handle extensions?  we've got it.  trailer restraint system for strap-free motorcycle transport?  we set the standard.  don't settle for less.
