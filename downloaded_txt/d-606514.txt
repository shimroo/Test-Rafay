zone 8 jamboree 2010 "bingara"





 so last weekend (friday, saturday & sunday) we (gravesend pony club) went to bingara showgrounds for the zone 8 jamboree. we took a full team of 18 riders age between 5 and 17 and 4 associates aged 17 & under 25. gravesend managed to come 2nd this year, lost to bingara. it had been a long time coming considering we had won for 7 years straight i believe (this could be incorrect) bingara had a very strong team last year so it was time that we started getting worried. bingara won with flying colours which was great to see.
as for the associate team (trent, brodie, hayley and myself plus of course my pony señor rito dorito) we set out to win the associate point score which we managed to do with bingara coming 2nd to us.  
my achieves are as follows:

* 4th dressage
* 3rd one day event
* 1st surry (jump)
* 1st am7 (jump)
* 3rd am3 (jump)
* 1st barrels
* 2nd flags
* 2nd bends
* 1st girl rider
* 3rd associate hack
* 3rd pairs with trent

*** highest point score girl ***
***associate highest point score team ***

one day event
not only did we ride we managed to party hard on the nights by doing the camp to camp walk around and ended back at the horton camp with louise sitting around the only fire on the whole ground (must have been the polox coming out of her) pretty sure fires weren’t permitted. trent managed to somehow write his name with the dressage poles whilst drunk. 
many thanks to bingara for holding from what i believe one of the best jamboree's i have had in a while.

first blog





so this is the first blog i have done, i’m not much of a writer or anything like that. i have started this because some girls have basically convinced me to do this. then also thought it is a good way to record my horse event success.
