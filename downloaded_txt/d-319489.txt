sdksupplies offers you the best
                selection of custom-made and high quality martial arts
                equipment on the internet. check out our departments
                below and if you don't find what you're looking for,
                drop us a line, chances are we can make it or find it
                for you. our prices usually include taxes and shipping
                in the usa and canada. we ship worldwide so just email
                us to check on prices. we don't hide those costs from
                you, and we don't do the $x.99 thing either, we figure

                something that's $49.99 is $40.

"it's not exactly full of beautiful models in
                  undies but you might find something you want." 
by the way, all prices are in whole numbers
                    because we figure most people have caught on to the
                    $xx.99 thing... although i must confess $xx.99
                    always looks better to me. we also include shipping
                    costs up front rather than tack it on later. call us
                    if you want more than one item and we'll adjust the
                    shipping prices then.
