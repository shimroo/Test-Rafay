welcome to


americar


   americar is a personal web site with links, information, photos etc which i have
    collected over the years being involved with the american car scene.
i started with a 1969 mustang fastback which may seem surprising by today's following,
    as this is where many mustang enthusiasts would like to aspire too. for more info
    on my early interest, photos & links click on the mustang link above. there is also
    information on my ultimate mustang experience when i was lucky enough to take part
    in the american pony drive to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the mustang. this
    was a us road trip coast to coast in my own car after being shipped with other european
    mustangs out to florida..!    




this is my favourite mustang. the 1969 shelby gt500. i always remember reading an
    article once which remarked these cars came from an era when âmen were men and mustangs
    had more scoops than a sunday newspaper!â
