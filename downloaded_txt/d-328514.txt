why boarding school?



 
  







"boarding school students are better prepared for college than students who attend private day schools and public school. ... boarding school students also make faster progress in their careers. the reason for these results may be a direct result of essentially being immersed in an academic environment full time."
— blythe grossberg, psy.d.
psy.d. rutgers university
b.a. harvard university
