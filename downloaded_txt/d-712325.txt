  sadly, we weren't able to visit @ordersofstjohncaretrust chestnut court this week for caring at christmas due to a norovirus outbreak. but our team stopped by with a special delivery of christmas cards so residents could still write and send greeting cards to their loved ones and play a part in #cardmitment this year. we're wishing all the residents a speedy recovery.

  imagine moving into a new home and seeing your first piece of post drop onto the welcome mat? or being delivered a handwritten card when you're not feeling 100% yourself? every time you catch a glimpse of that card on the shelf, it's bound to lift your mood - and it would be much better than a text that you never look at again. so why not make someone's day and send them a card?

  day 4 of the #cardmitment challenge is about sharing your card keepsakes. this feels like something often forgotten when it comes to greeting cards, and how you can hold onto a heartfelt message for years' to come; not something you can do with a text message or facebook post.

  another amazing business, @claridges.warwick.shop, sharing the #cardmitment message - spreading the word of how receiving a card can transform someone's day. there's still plenty of time to send your cards by second class post in time for 25th december - who's already started their list of recipients? 🙋

  did you know today is world post day? and it's been 150 years of the universal postal union; enabling communication across nations. but when was the last time you posted a letter? or sent a card overseas? with the digital world we live in, it can transform someone's day to receive a handwritten card or letter.

  you've heard of mother and father's day, but did you know this sunday, 6th october, is grandparents' day? a card can serve as a thoughtful reminder of how much we care, so even if you don't manage to get one for the weekend, why not send a card to a relative to help make their day?
