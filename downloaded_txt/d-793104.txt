 new release


“tab’s sturdy, soulful, grainy voice—often compared to that of otis redding– which alone defines his music, his guitar chops have improved from very good to world class. he wields that beat up telecaster like a machine gun, shooting out scorching solos with a dense, meaty attack evoking the mosquito and alligator infested humidity and dark, somewhat ominous nuances of his home turf.” - rock & blues muse
"this is one not to be missed."  - relix
"on i hear thunder, tab benoit does more than just play the blues, he defines it’s future while paying homage to its rich past.” – making a scene

about tab benoit
one of the most impressive guitarists to emerge from the rich bayous of southern louisiana in recent
                    years, tab benoit’s guitar tone can be recognized before his otis-redding-ish voice resonates from
                    the speakers. he doesn’t rely on any effects and his set up is simple. it consists of a guitar,
                    cord, and category 5 amplifier. the effects that you hear come from his fingers.
 born on november 17, 1967, in baton rouge, louisiana, benoit grew up in the nearby oil and fishing
                    town of houma, where he still resides today. musically, he was exposed early on to traditional cajun
                    waltzes and the country music broadcast on his hometown’s only radio station. benoit’s father was
                    himself a musician; as such, the family home was filled with various instruments. he began playing
                    drums but switched to guitar because the only gigs to be had in rural louisiana were held in
                    churches and at church fairs, and organizers would not allow loud drums to be played at these
                    events.
