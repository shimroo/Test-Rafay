hawaiian style cuisinehere at the tiki terrace, you can experience dishes like shredded kalua pork, coconut chicken, korean beef grilled short ribs and garlic shrimp! we take pride in our fresh taro chips with pineapple salsa, hand rolled egg rolls and ono potstickers!  when paired with a tropical tiki cocktail and the sweet sounds of the steel guitar, you'll have to be reminded that you're actually in the suburbs of chicago.
