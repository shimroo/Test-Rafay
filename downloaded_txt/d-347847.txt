holiday kickoffsaturday, december 6, 2025






























the camaraderie between the jazz aficionados attending the shows, as well as, the volunteers & staff is always such a great experience for me  the opportunity to hear new music and interact with some of the musicians is also wonderful!  i love the positive energy this festival brings to the city of reading. — ann marie m.









berks arts council is one of the best organizations to volunteer for.— gloria s.









it’s a great way to give back to the community.  also, it's fun and you get to hear lots of great music and meet nice people.—  neal s.









the art of jazz exhibition is designed to let visual artists translate various media, various ideas, and concepts through the musical experience of jazz. it's a great way to celebrate artists that do visual art and sort of celebrate the attitude and the personality of jazz.— tim compton, artistic director at goggleworks center for the arts.
