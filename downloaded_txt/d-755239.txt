jesus messiah, jesus christ, the son of god













in the beginning wasâ jesusâ (a.k.a. the word), and jesus was withâ god, and jesus was god. jesus was with god in the beginning. â  â  â john 1:1-2there areâ threeâ who were present in the beginning: the father, jesus the son, and theâ holy spirit; andâ these three are one â god.â  â 1 john 5:7; deuteronomy 6:4jesus createdâ theâ heavens and the earth.genesis 1:1; john 1:3; colossians 1:16; hebrews 1:2on the first day god madeâ light. genesis 1:3on the second day god made the sky or atmosphere. â  â  â  â  â  â  â  â  â  â genesis 1:6on the third day god made theâ plantsâ and trees. genesis 1:11on the fourth day god made theâ sun,â moon, andâ stars.genesis 1:16on the fifth day god madeâ great whales, sea animals, andâ birds. â genesis 1:20-21on the sixth day god made the land animals, includingâ dinosaurs* and man. genesis 1:24, 27; job 40:15-17*the creation of theâ heavens, theâ earth, and everything in them was completed inâ six daysâ by jesus christ.genesis 1:31; 2:1-2; john 1:3; colossians 1:16; hebrews 1:2god gave plants and animals the ability to reproduce, only after their own kind. genesis 1:11-12, 21-22, 24-25, 26-28birds are not the offspring of dinosaursâ andâ man is not the offspring of apes.â theâ theory of evolutionâ is false. (1)god created man in his own image and likeness; one male named adam and one female named eve. genesis 1:27god has made throughâ adam and eveâ all nations andâ racesâ of man to live on the earth. acts 17:26everyone has brown skin. (2)when adam sinned by disobeying god,â deathâ passed to all men. â  â romans 5:12that's why it is appointed to man to die once, and after this theâ judgment.â hebrews 9:27â since man dies only once,â reincarnationâ is false. (3)â god sent his son jesus from heaven to earth to save the world by death on the cross. john 12:27, 32-33, 47for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him shall notâ perishâ but have everlasting life. john 3:16jesus, being born of a virgin, became human and lived among us. god was with us in human flesh. matthew 1:23; john 1:14as a child jesus was obedient to his mother mary and his adoptive father joseph. luke 2:51joseph did not have sex with mary until after jesus was born. â  â  â  â matthew 1:24-25jesus had four brothers and at least two sisters, which were born of mary and joseph. matthew 13:55-57; 12:46-50; mark 3:31-35; luke 8:19-21; acts 1:13-14; galatians 1:19mary was not a perpetual virgin. matthew 1:24-25jesus was in the world, and the world was made by jesus, but people did not know jesus as god. john 1:10at age 30 jesus began to heal the sick, raise the dead, and feed the hungry. luke 3:23; matthew 11:5; john 6:5-14jesus also walked on the sea, cast out demons, and calmed storms. mark 6:47-50, 1:23-28, 4:35-41; matthew 14:22-31jesus preached to many saying, the lord ourâ godâ is one lord. and you shall love the lord yourâ godâ with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. you shall love your neighbor as yourself. and in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. mark 12:28-34; matthew 7:12jesus also said, repent (change your mind, turn from your sins and turn toâ god), because the kingdom of heaven is at hand. â  â  â  matthew 4:17; mark 1:15jesus forgave sins! â matthew 9:2-6; mark 2:5-10youngâ children and infantsâ were brought to jesus, that he might bless them. jesus said, let the little children come to me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of god.mark 10:13-16it is the parents responsibility to introduce their children to the lord jesus christ. proverbs 22:6jesus always obeyed god the father, even to theâ death on the cross.â philippians 2:8jesus diedâ for our sins, he was buried, and heâ roseâ again the third day as prophesied and recorded in theâ scriptures.1 corinthians 15:3-4after jesusâ rose from the dead, many people saw him, touched him, and talked with him. â jesus was seen by more than five hundred of his followers at the same time. 1 corinthians 15:5-8they watched as jesus ascended back into heaven. acts 1:9jesus promised to return and take all who believe in him to heaven. there they will enjoy their new perfect bodies, and will be with the lord forever.john 14:1-3; 1 thessalonians 4:13-18;1 corinthians 15â all who believe in the lord jesus christ have everlasting life. all who do not believe in the lord jesus christ shall be cast into theâ lake of fireâ (hell), prepared for the devil and his angels.john 3:18, 36; matthew 25:41, 46; revelation 20:10â there shall be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth.matthew 8:12; matthew 13:49-51what good will it be if you gain the whole world, and lose your own soul? â is anything worth more than your soul?matthew 16:26; mark 8:36; luke 9:25the invisible things of god from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by theâ things that are made, even gods eternal power and godhead, so that you are without excuse. â romans 1:20do not beâ deceived. for by gods grace you have been saved through faith in jesus christ, and not from anything you have done or not done. salvation is a free gift from god not a reward or payment for doing good works, lest anyone should boast or brag. ephesians 2:8-9a man is not justified (saved) by doing the works of the law but by faith in jesus christ. for by the works of the law no man shall be justified (saved). galatians 2:16for if righteousness (salvation) comes through the law, i.e. keeping the ten commandments and/or doing good works, then jesus christ died in vain. galatians 2:21â jesus was asked, what shall we do, that we may work the works of god? jesus answered and said, "this is the work of god, that you believe in him whom god has sent." john 6:28-29jesus was also asked, how can we know the way? â jesus answered, "i am the way, the truth, and the life. â no one comes to the father, but by me." john 14:6believe in/on the lord jesus christ, and you will be saved.acts 16:31question:who raised jesus christ from the dead?a) god the fatherb) jesus christc) the holy spiritd) all of the abovee) none of the abovegod the father raised jesus christ from the dead (romans 10:9), jesus christ raised himself from the dead (john 2:19-21; john 10:17-18), and the holy spirit raised jesus christ from the dead (romans 8:11). the answer is d) all of the above!jesus christ did many otherâ miracles, which are not written here. but these are written that you may believe that jesus is theâ christ, the son of god, and that byâ believing in him, you may have everlasting life. john 20:30-31 â  â  â  â ______________________________________________________note: theâ scriptureâ references are paraphrased from the kjvâ bible.*job 40:15-24. what animal, other than aâ dinosaur, moves its tail like a cedar?1)â evolutionâ theory - the act or process of one kind of animal changing into a different kind of animal. â as by this theory, innumerable transitional forms must have existed. why do we not find them imbedded in the crust of the earth?2)â bill nye the science guy, episode 4, skin.3)â reincarnationâ - continual rebirths in human bodies until the soul has reached a state of perfection. reincarnation, resurrection, and resuscitation are not the same.jesus christ was not reincarnated or resuscitated. â jesus christ was resurrected!copyright â© 1997 byâ jesusâ messiahâ .com. permission is granted to link to, distribute, and copy this page.â jesus messiah.com.now you can listen to the audio bible in overâ 1000 languagesâ for free!click here!1jesus christjesus christ videosjesus christ tractsonline biblesthe word 4 kids
