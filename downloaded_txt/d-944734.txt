expanding our capabilities
we are leveling up higher-ed marketing by crafting human-centric web experiences that illuminate your brand and connect your institution with your ideal audience. we’ve always been about more than just the website itself, and now we can offer a comprehensive suite of strategic services and deliver more value for our client partners.
 










 user experience design

our designers are fearlessly creative. we work as a team to develop creative feature ideas, preliminary navigation sets, and page layouts for your new .edu. we will review and collaborate with you to ensure a shared vision for the project. your new college or university website will be beautiful, flexible, modular—and it will get results.




content strategy

generic content. information that’s hard to find. broken links. sound familiar? your institution serves myriad audiences—prospective and current students, faculty, staff, donors, community partners—and they all need to find relevant information quickly and easily. with our user-centric approach to content strategy and information architecture, you will have compelling content with the right message, organized for people. 






user research

our approach starts with empathy—understanding the hearts and heads of the people we are trying to reach. we blend both qualitative and quantitative data through stakeholder interviews, existing research, and current site analytics. with this research, we can make well-informed decisions about content, asset planning, information architecture, and design to create a meaningful, immersive, data-driven website.




technology services

our technology expertise is as developed as our creative skills. we’ve launched hundreds of sites on dozens of platforms and approach our front-end development with care and craft. we have the skills and expertise necessary to partner with on-campus it teams—bridging gaps and making it easier to accomplish goals.






search engine optimization

about 70% of students use search engines to research schools and degree programs. that's why it's critical to create the content students are looking for and to optimize your website and social media for search. we use online tools like google business profile optimization and processes like seo. we optimize your social media posts and website design to drive traffic to your pages. with carnegie's strategies, you'll have results for every step of the enrollment funnel.
