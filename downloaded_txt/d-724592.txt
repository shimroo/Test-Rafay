hi matt,
i will recommend you to anyone i know who needs an agent.  i almost (a few months ago) bought a condo in grandezza.  at the time when i signed my offer, my agent was having me sign a form for her to get an extra $195 commission from me,  the buyer.  i asked her about this, and she said many companies now do that.  the buyers rejected my offer, and then i decided not to shop with that agent anymore, so it didn't matter.  never heard of a buyer paying a commission.  thanks for your help, and you are now my #1 agent.  always will recommend you!  kim kennedy
