a bank that understands economic development

"i have done loans with a lot of different banks throughout my career, but what really set this one apart is the unique relationship ... keystone on 8th was a particularly complicated deal with a lot of obstacles to overcome. northwest bank had a team of people working to bring it to the finish line. it was a great collaboration. i felt like the bank wanted the project to happen as much as i did."
joe cordaro, presidentjgc holdings











it’s about the relationship

"i appreciate that northwest bank offers us a full-service, one stop experience. but where it really goes above and beyond is the people. the people at northwest bank have taken the time to get to know our business and understand what we do. the fact that we’re working with local bankers who we can sit down with and explain our needs and corporate vision is a huge advantage."
