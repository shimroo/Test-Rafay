the chess center operated from 2002 through 2017.  see industrial cyberphysical systems (icyphy) for more recent research. the chess website is no longer active. 

		    the chess 
		    center was aimed at developing model-based and tool-supported design methodologies 
		    for real-time fault tolerant software on heterogeneous distributed platforms. 
		    we are bridging the gap between computer science and systems science by 
		    developing the foundations of a modern systems science that is simultaneously 
		    computational and physical. this represents a major departure from the 
		    current, separated structure of computer science (cs), computer engineering 
		    (ce), and electrical engineering (ee): it reintegrates information and 
		    physical sciences. the center was initially funded in part by an information 
		      technology research (itr) project from the national 
		      science foundation (nsf) and now receives funding from government and industry. 











what are cyber-physical systems?

	      the center for hybrid and embedded software systems (chess) is
	      building foundational theories and practical tools for systems that
	      combine computation, networking, and physical dynamics.  in such
	      systems, embedded computers and networks monitor and control
	      physical processes in feedback loops where physical processes affect
	      computations and vice versa. for the last 30 years or so, computers
	      have been increasingly embedded in stand-alone, self-contained
	      products. we are poised, however, for a revolutionary transformation
	      as these embedded computers become networked.  the transformation is
	      analogous to the enormous increment in the utility of personal
	      computers with the advent of the web. just as personal computers
	      changed from word processors to global communications devices and
	      information portals, embedded computers will change from small
	      self-contained boxes to cyber-physical systems, which sense, monitor
	      and control our intrinsically distributed human environment.

	      cyber-physical systems (cps)
		are integrations of computation,
		networking, and physical processes. embedded computers and networks
		monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback
		loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa.
		the economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly
		greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being
		made worldwide to develop the technology. there are considerable
		challenges, particularly because the physical components of such
		systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively
		different from those in general-purpose computing. moreover, the
		standard abstractions used in computing do not fit the physical
		parts of the system well.
applications of cps arguably have the potential to dwarf the 20th
		century it revolution. they include high confidence medical devices
		and systems, assisted living, traffic control and safety, advanced
		automotive systems, process control, energy conservation,
		environmental control, avionics, instrumentation, critical
		infrastructure control (electric power, water resources, and
		communications systems for example), distributed robotics
		(telepresence, telemedicine), defense systems, manufacturing, and
		smart structures. it is easy to envision new capabilities, such as
		distributed micro power generation coupled into the power grid,
		where timing precision and security issues loom large.
		transportation systems could benefit considerably from better
		embedded intelligence in automobiles, which could improve safety and
		efficiency. networked autonomous vehicles could dramatically enhance
		the effectiveness of our military and could offer substantially more
		effective disaster recovery techniques. networked building control
		systems (such as hvac and lighting) could significantly improve
		energy efficiency and demand variability, reducing our dependence on
		fossil fuels and our greenhouse gas emissions. in communications,
		cognitive radio could benefit enormously from distributed consensus
		about available bandwidth and from distributed control technologies.
		financial networks could be dramatically changed by precision
		timing. large scale services systems leveraging rfid and other
		technologies for tracking of goods and services could acquire the
		nature of distributed real-time control systems. distributed
		real-time games that integrate sensors and actuators could change
		the (relatively passive) nature of on-line social interactions. the
		positive economic impact of any one of these applications areas
		would be enormous.

	    duncan (university of chicago),
	    nandita mitra (rutgers university),
	    nashlie sephus (mississippi state university) and heather taylor (university
	    of vermont).
	    these students worked with individual mentors throughout the summer
	    performing research and supporting activities in the area
	    of hybrid and embedded systems. the mentors for the summer were saurabh
	    amin, elaine cheong, alex kurzhanskiy, and todd templeton.
	    each student performed an individual project, culminating in a research
	      paper and poster presentation.          


 
 may 31, 2006:
	    the 2006 annual report is available.
	  


 
may 8, 2006:
	    the may 2006 ieee computer magazine contains a cover feature
	    by edward a. lee: 
	    "the problem with threads"
	    
	      for concurrent programming to become mainstream, we must discard
	      threads as a programming model. nondeterminism should be judiciously
	      and carefully introduced where needed, and it should be explicit in
	      programs.
	    



 
march 15, 2006: 
	    cosi: the communication synthesis infrastructure released.
	    the cosi project aims at providing an infrastructure to assist designer in the difficult task of interconnecting components.
	  


 
the bears chess
	    open house was held on thursday, february 23, 2006, from 3:00-5:00
	    pm. posters available online.


 
february 21-22, 2006: 
	    chess researchers, profs. 
	    gabor karsai,
	    t. john koo,
	    shankar sastry and
	    janos sztipanovits,
	    were invited to give lectures at the workshop on
	    hybrid and embedded systems: technologies and applications. the workshop
	    was jointly organized by the hong kong science and technology parks
	    corporation and the department of automation and computer-aided
	    engineering, the chinese university of hong kong, held at the hong kong
	    science and technology parks. chess researchers
	    also participated in an open forum moderated by the dr. onching yue,
	    science advisor of the innovation and technology commission, the
	    government of the hong kong special administrative region, on many
	    important issues ranging from the scientific research to application
	    development of hybrid and embedded systems in the greater china region.
	  




	    the nsf third year itr site visit was held on monday, november 21, 2005.  
	    
program presentations




october 7, 2005:
	    hyvisual 5.0.1 released.

	    hybrid systems are systems with continuous-time dynamics,
	    discrete events, and discrete mode changes. this visual modeler
	    supports construction of hierarchical hybrid systems. it uses a
	    block-diagram representation of ordinary differential equations (odes)
	    to define continuous dynamics. it uses a bubble-and-arc diagram
	    representation of finite state machines to define discrete behavior.
	    hyvisual-5.0-alpha includes better support for combining
	    continuous-time signals and discrete events, include multiple
	    discrete events that occur at the same time.
	  



october 5, 2005:
	    ptolemy ii 5.0.1 released.
	    the ptolemy project studies modeling, simulation, and design of
	    concurrent, real-time, embedded systems. the focus is on assembly of
	    concurrent components. the key underlying principle in the project is
	    the use of well-defined models of computation that govern the
	    interactions between components.  this release includes improved
	    modeling of hybrid systems, a dynamic dataflow dowmain and a heterochronous dataflow domain.
	  



august 25, 2005:
	    the chess server is on new hardware.  if you manage a
