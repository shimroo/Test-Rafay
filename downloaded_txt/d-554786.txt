highly valued hunters in ancient egypt, salukis were often depicted on the walls of tombs.
      
did you know? salukis come in two coat types, smooth and feathered
      
the saluki is one of the oldest known dog breeds, dating back over 5,000 years
      
salukis are capable of endurance and speed — and have been clocked at over 30 miles per hour.
       




























the saluki is an ancient hunting dog. for thousands of years they would accompany the bedouins, their hunting falcons, and their arabian horses on hunts in the desert. the bedouins would release the falcons to look for game from above, and the salukis would follow the falcon. when the game, usually a gazelle, was spotted, the bird would circle until the salukis caught sight of it and would run it down with the bedouins following on horseback.










salukis became established in the us in the mid-1920s and were recognized by the american kennel club (akc) in 1927. the saluki club of america (scoa) was formed the same year and is the akc parent club for the breed. scoa promotes the multi-talented saluki through public and judge education, as well as hosting regional conformation specialties and an annual national specialty. lure coursing, rally, obedience, and agility trials are also held at the national.






























saluki males should stand between 23 and 28 inches tall when measured at the shoulder, while females may be considerably smaller. on average, they weigh between 40-60 lbs although some large males may weigh more and a petite female less. their life expectancy is 10-14 years.
