louise’s trattoriadine-intake-outcatering 



louise's first opened its doors back in 1978 in santa monica, ca. it was one of the first trattoria's of its kind in southern california. gathering chefs from small towns in italy, louise's began a legacy of great italian cuisine on the westside of los angeles and beyond. that legacy still inspires great italian restaurants across the city of angels.  many of the recipes we use today are still those of the original menu. they are just as unique as  they were when louise's first opened. some are also a part of my family's recipe books, namely  from my grandmother and her eight sisters. at louise’s, we incorporate local and fresh ingredients, along with regional specialties from both italy and southern california.  today, we still own and operate the last remaining gem of the original louise's fleet at our larchmont village location along with long-time partners chef luis & general manager paul. both luis and paul have been a part of our family for nearly 25 years. i enjoy visiting our larchmont store weekly and speaking with our legacy and first-time customers. there's always a great story to be had that usually starts with our famous focaccia bread...rob serritella, owner

our larchmont village restaurant is located just east of hancock park. halfway between mid-wilshire and downtown, this quaint little shopping district is the perfect “getaway” in the middle of the day. always humming in the lunch and dinner hours, our larchmont location is a favorite for business lunches and local dinners. and of course, its proximity to hollywood makes for a great start to a night on the town.get directions
