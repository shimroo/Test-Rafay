what our clients say 


























dj larry was fantastic! our meeting with him before the wedding was great. he listened to our hopes for music and entertainment and gave us wonderful advice. the dance floor was hopping the whole reception and it was everything we could have wanted. would definitely recommend instant request.

these guys are awesome to work with. from the initial phone call, the planner, setup, selection, etc. they really knew how to work the room, i had many guests comment on how awesome they were.

had the best experience with instant request! from the initial meeting, to the event planning tool, to the meeting of the actual dj during wedding month, through to the execution of it all on the wedding day - it was a top notch and professional experience! i felt confident at the service i was getting no matter who i interacted with. and great price compared to other quotes i got!

we had jimmy b as the dj - he was fantastic. very experienced and comfortable reading the crowd and working the room. one guest commented it was their favorite wedding music ever!! fun to have tunes that the adults and grandparents enjoyed at first, then transitioned to a more mixed/ dance feeling the second half of the night. something for everyone and smooth transitions throughout!

night to remember!!! dj rick had us dancing all night! prior to the wedding he called us and we spoke for about 45 minutes on what we wanted. he is very engaging and he listened to us!

instant request gave us the most perfect wedding ever! we wanted a dance floor that didn’t stop and they delivered! we’ve heard from so many of our guests that our instant request dj, auctavias, was absolutely incredible and we couldn’t agree more. friends and family raved about our dance floor for days afterwards. one of my bridesmaids even texted a week later saying - “can i just say i can’t stop thinking about the dance floor at your wedding? your dj absolutely crushed.” instant request was easy to work with, professional, made our day so so smooth and played banger after banger. they paced everything out perfectly. would highly recommend!

we were so lucky to be paired up with dj chad! not only has chad been in the business for a long time, he was so down to earth and easy to talk to. he went above and beyond throughout our wedding day to make sure my husband and i had the best day possible. he was by far one of the most memorable parts of our wedding as you can tell this is a passion of his. thank you so much chad!

i highly recommend instant request dj, especially their black tie option. we worked with dj samuel and he was the best dj we could've asked for! i had very specific snippets i wanted played from particular songs for our ceremony/first dances, and he nailed it. everything was perfect! sam was extremely communicative and very accommodating to our needs. he kept the dancefloor packed and we received several comments on how much everyone enjoyed him. sam helped make our day perfect and we're so thankful! instant request dj's online planner is also super helpful in organizing all music/details needed for the day. i felt very comfortable about everything going to plan throughout the entire process.

we had the pleasure of working with xavier on our wedding day, and we are so grateful that he was assigned as our dj! from the second i stepped into the venue he introduced himself, and was so communicative throughout the entire night which was so appreciated. he made every transition seamless, from the ceremony to cocktail hour to speeches and the dance. we got compliments from guests on how great his music choices were. the dance floor was packed the entire night and he absolutely knew how to read the room and played music for everyone. i am so glad we chose instant request, and we got so lucky with xavier!

we had the absolute pleasure of having dj nonstop from instant request dj at our wedding, and he was nothing short of amazing! he truly epitomized professionalism and kept everyone dancing all night long, catering to guests of all ages.

what impressed us most was how he took our requests and preferences to heart, ensuring the music perfectly matched the vibe we wanted for our special day. his flexibility and attentiveness made the whole experience seamless, and his infectious energy kept the celebration lively from start to finish. the dance floor was full the whole time 🙂

dj nonstop played a crucial role in making our wedding unforgettable. we couldn’t have asked for a better dj!
