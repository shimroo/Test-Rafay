we strive to leave lasting positive impressionshere's what our clients have to say





















“on behalf of everyone at quintana events team, i would like to personally thank all of you at park avenue catering for your hard work, great attitudes, flexibility and overall can-do mindset on our crazy rain wedding… there is no way we could have transitioned that event the way we did without every single one of you.”

— alex quintana, quintana events





“park avenue catering is professional, punctual and serves incredible food presented with elegance and sophistication. i manage an event space and know that when park avenue is the caterer there will be no problems with the events. their food always brings gasps of joy and satisfaction amongst the crowd, and not just for the wonderful taste, but also for the thoughtful and stylish presentation. working with park avenue will always wow the crowd and ensure a successful event.” 

— david seyms, operations manager, vintage house





 “our guests were blown away at not only the incredible flavors and tastes of the food, but also the presentation. the quality was unlike anything we’ve ever seen at a wedding before and we felt incredibly lucky to have chosen such an incredible caterer. we loved working with park avenue catering… and had a great time curating our tray-passed appetizers, plated two-course dinner, bar menu and signature cocktails… we can’t recommend park avenue catering enough!”

— morgan h.





“park avenue catering was incredible to work with from start to finish. she listened to what we wanted but also gave super helpful advice along the way.”

— christine s.





“thank you all so much for making their wedding so special, fun, and beautiful. the couple was extremely happy with everything. i hope we all get to work together again!” 

lindsey nickel, lovely day events





“amazing service and delicious food! i would give them one hundred stars if i could. our guests are still raving about the food! each dish was as fresh, delicious and beautifully presented as you’d experience at a high-end sonoma restaurant.”

megan h





“we were incredibly impressed with the professionalism of the whole team the night of the wedding - everything was seamless.”

bethany w. 





 “park avenue catering’s service team made everything go as smooth as possible - they kept the line for the bar short, made sure the bride and groom also received appetizers and drinks… were pleasant with all our guests, the meal (family style) tasted as good as when we tried it at our tasting, and guests were raving about the appetizers and main courses the next day.”

kevin j. 





“our wedding in may 2024 was amazing!” we chose to serve indian food. my husband eats meat, but i am vegetarian so the indian menu had the best vegetarian options while incorporating meat in a natural way... all the indian dishes were flavorful, perfectly cooked and so tasty!!!!”

— anonymous





“the food was excellent, we received many compliments. our venue was beer and wine only, and park avenue’s fermented cocktails were excellent (get the pisco sour!).”

— andrew g.
