welcome to guildwars wiki,
an unofficial fanfic wiki for arenanet's competitive online rpg, guild wars.


don't give account information to 4chan
beware of anonymous who ask for your account information "for teh lulz". the request "account or gtfo" is designed to trick you into divulging your personal information, which is then used to have fun with your account. never give your account information to anonymous. also remember: if you let 4chan have your login details, your account will likely be suspended in short order, but at least it will be funny.

[add fictional announcement]



current news
nicholas the traveler, nicholas sandford, wanted by the shining blade, and zaishen challenge quests (including zashien vanquishes) are now updated on guildwiki. as they are currently being worked into fan fiction here.
hall of monuments – check out the hom reward calculator. this can be used to determine which characters get tortured in gw2.
fictional guild wars login announcements – fun news delivered directly.
newly... edited articles, created articles, updated discussions, uploaded images




game basics
guides – learn from others' experiences and then you shall know "kung fu". as with kung fu, you learn more about your mental and physical abilities.
new player guides – for your first time: prophecies / factions / nightfall / eye of the north
interface – what you see on your screen is not white.
game mechanics – how damage, energy, health, etc. work. this is guild wars basic style.
glossary – a reference for the lingo. you shall know l33t after this.
avoid common scams from in-game hustlers. always remember, the cake is a lie.

almost everything, sorted by profession is here.
the different character classes and their elites, mental attitudes, and skills.
the armor you need, the runes for the bonuses you desire and your mental attitude improvement.
weapons – upgrade, inscribe, and modify your weapon to help with your kung fu (your physical and mental abilities).
unique items – special gear that you will have to pry from a boss' dead cold hands.
items – miscellaneous items that can be obtained.
you will need materials to craft your armor and weapons for your kung fu.
consumables – grant temporary effects to help increase your kung fu.
dye your armor and weapons to look cool, but some weapons cannot be dyed.
miniatures – birthday presents and special game awards. this is for the "cuteness" in you.
salvage items and trophies – loot from your slain foes. "much kung fu, you have."
books – track your kung fu progress throughout the game.
guilds – how to create and maintain a guild full of kung fu people like you.
alliances – groups of guilds full of kung fu people that have banded together.
heroes and henchmen – managing npcs in your party that help your kung fu.
titles – your personal in-game kung fu type achievements. "way to go!"
builds – combinations of skills and suggestions of builds are at pvxwiki.



gameplay types
pve – player vs. environment
