						high rock lake is a reservoir lake located in the davidson and rowan counties of north carolina, serving as a boundary between them. it is a reservoir for hydroelectric power generation. it is the northernmost of the uwharrie lakes and the second largest lake in north carolina behind lake norman. its water surface covers 15,180 acres and there are 365 miles of shoreline. it begins at the confluence of the yadkin river and the south yadkin river. the lake's name is derived from neighboring "high rock mountain", the tallest mountain in the uwharrie mountains. high rock lake is currently managed and operated by the alcoa company.the lake is spanned by two bridges at the northern end of the lake: the i-85/us 52 bridge and the older us 29/us 70/nc 150 bridge. the nc 8 causeway crosses the abbotts creek tributary of the lake, as does a bridge at holloway church road farther north of abbotts creek. railroad tracks and their causeways also cross the southeastern portion of the lake at the hwy 8 causeway and over flat swamp creek. numerous communities align the lake's banks including lexington, salisbury, southmont, linwood, high rock, and spencer.
