what is a biblical worldview?

what is a biblical worldview? everyone has a worldview. whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that affect the way we view all of life and reality. a worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us. our worldview is formed by our education, our upbringing, the culture we live in, the books we read, the media and movies we absorb, etc. for many people their worldview is simply something they have absorbed by osmosis from their surrounding cultural influences. they have never thought strategically about what they believe and wouldn’t be able to give a rational defense of their beliefs to others. the purpose of our christian apologetics ministry is to equip people to think and live with a consistent and cohesive biblical worldview. we believe that god exists (heb. 11:6) and that he is the standard by which we measure everything else. a biblical worldview teaches us: god created everything that exists (gen.1:1) and everything is held together by him (col. 1:17). we believe the bible is god’s divinely inspired word, revealed to mankind (2 tim. 3:16). we believe that the fullness of god came to earth and lived in the human body of jesus christ of nazareth 2,000 years ago (col. 1:19). we believe that mankind chose to rebel against god in the garden of eden and because of that act of rebellion, sin and death entered the world (rom. 5:12-14).  we believe that believing in (john 3:15-19, 5:24), and obeying (luke 8:21, john 3:20-21, john 14:21, 23-24), jesus christ is the only way to have eternal life or to be reunited with god (acts 4:10-12). we hope that the resources offered through this website will help you to understand that the christian faith is reasonable and makes sense in a world that has lost its moral compass. truth is absolute, not relativistic, and can only be understood by submitting to the lordship of jesus christ, the one who said “i am the way, the truth and the life, no one can come to the father except through me.” (john 14:6) while christianity is believed by faith, it is most definitely a reasonable and rational faith. it answers the questions of the mind and the heart. we all live by faith. some people have faith in themselves. some have faith in the government or in a hope for world peace. some have faith in their money, their education or their employment. all of those things are temporal and can change. they can all let us down. our health can fail, we can lose our job, we can end a meaningful relationship with someone we care about. life changes, but god can be depended on through it all. he will never leave nor forsake those who belong to him. (heb. 13:5b) our desire for you is christ will live in your hearts by faith, and that you will come to know and understand with us the height and the depth and the width and the length of the love of christ. it surpasses all human knowledge. we pray that you can be filled with the fullness of god. (eph. 3:18-19) ~israel wayne this christian worldview website is a non-denominational outreach designed to reach seekers and serve the body of christ.
