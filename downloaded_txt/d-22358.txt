a collection of outdoor activities in the hudson valley



a tribute to ken roberts


























bike biking in the hudson valley has so much to offer between rail trails, bridges, hills, farms, and more. discover routes for all levels and beautiful scenery as well as food, lodging, equipment, transportation, and safety. 















skiwhile many believe skiing is out of reach and inaccessible in nyc, cross country and backcountry skiing is only an hour out of the city. go even farther north and discover some of the best skiing in the east at mt. van hoevenberg and prospect mountain.
