“i believe that bryant university definitely provides the platform to make students thrive and to really home in on their passions. for myself personally, i found that bryant fit well with my multifaceted identity. being somebody that is interested in immunology, epidemiology, but also fashion and communication, i found that bryant is foundational and comprehensive in the way that you are allowed to do so much and still not burn yourself out or create a complete impact and really see the fruits of your labor and your hard work.”
