our groups


utah outdoors is a group where we passionately believe that the great outdoors is for everyone. hiking isn't just about conquering summits; it's about forging connections, building community, and rejuvenating the spirit. our mission is to offer a welcoming environment where individuals of all backgrounds and skill levels can come together, share experiences, and collectively enrich their lives through the beauty of utah's outdoors.
we believe that through our shared experiences, we can inspire one another to venture beyond our comfort zones, build resilience, and create lasting memories. our goal is not just to hike, but to elevate lives, promote well-being, and build a community bound by respect, enthusiasm, and the shared thrill of discovery.



slow hikers unite utah is a group where we embrace the philosophy that the great outdoors should be accessible and enjoyable for all, regardless of pace. hiking is more than reaching the highest peaks; it's about appreciating the journey, connecting with nature, and fostering a sense of community. our group is dedicated to creating an inclusive space where hikers who prefer a slower pace can come together, share experiences, and immerse themselves in the tranquility of utah's landscapes.
we believe that by embracing the slower pace, we allow ourselves to truly connect with our surroundings, form deeper bonds with fellow hikers, and find rejuvenation in nature's calm. our mission is to provide a supportive environment where every step is valued, and every moment on the trail is an opportunity for personal growth and collective enrichment. our goal goes beyond the trails; it's about enriching lives, promoting mental and physical well-being, and building a community united by a love for nature, mutual respect, and the joy of leisurely exploration.



hiking for health in utah is a group where we are driven by the belief that the great outdoors is a gateway to better health and well-being for everyone. hiking is more than a physical journey to new heights; it's a path to personal transformation, community building, and spiritual renewal. our mission is to provide a nurturing environment where individuals, regardless of their fitness levels or hiking experience, can come together to support each other in their health and wellness goals through the invigorating beauty of utah's natural landscapes.
we understand that each step on a trail can be a step towards improved health, whether itâs losing weight, managing stress, or simply seeking a healthier lifestyle. our shared hiking experiences are designed to encourage and inspire one another to embrace outdoor activities as a means to enhance physical fitness, mental clarity, and overall life satisfaction. our objective transcends the act of hiking itself; itâs about fostering a community that values health and well-being, celebrates each member's progress, and is united by a commitment to personal growth and the exhilarating joy of exploring nature at its finest.










our hikes
utah outdoors, in its commitment to exploring the diverse landscapes around salt lake city, organizes a variety of hikes that cater to all interests and abilities. for those seeking to explore the unique geographical features of the area, the group occasionally organizes trips to more remote and less-traveled trails. these hikes often venture into the lesser-known corners of the wasatch range or towards the great salt lake's more secluded areas, like stansbury island. these outings are perfect for those looking to escape the city's hustle and experience utah's quieter, more untouched natural beauty. the group's leaders plan these hikes, with the intent that they will be both safe and enjoyable, while also providing opportunities to learn about the local ecology, geology, and history. such hikes might include bird watching, geological explorations, or discussions about the area's rich cultural heritage, adding educational value to the physical activity.
in addition to these nature-focused excursions, utah outdoors frequently leads night hikes, which offer a completely different perspective on the salt lake city area's landscapes. these hikes may occassionally be timed to coincide with meteor showers, lunar events, or may simply just be to enjoy the tranquility of the natural world after dark. destinations such as the trails around antelope island state park or the foothills near the city provide ideal settings for stargazing and enjoying the night sky, far from the light pollution of urban areas. these night hikes are not only about physical exercise; they provide a unique opportunity to connect with nature and others within the group in a profound way, offering moments of reflection and peace. the group does our best to ensure that these night-time adventures are conducted safely. whether itâs a daytime ascent of a peak or a gentle nighttime stroll under the stars, utah outdoors offers something for every outdoor enthusiast in the salt lake city area.

slow hikers unite utah, focuses on a different aspect of hiking. this group's hikes are designed for those who prefer to take a leisurely pace, savoring the journey as much as the destination. the hikes led by this group are often on trails that offer plenty of natural beauty but don't require vigorous physical exertion. locations such as antelope island state park or the easy trails in the cottonwood canyons are favorites, allowing hikers to enjoy the scenic views, observe wildlife, and take photographs without the pressure of keeping up a fast pace. the group places a strong emphasis on the social and experiential aspects of hiking, encouraging members to connect with each other and share their experiences. the pace is relaxed, and stops to enjoy the surroundings are frequent, making these hikes ideal for those who want to enjoy the outdoors in a stress-free, supportive environment.

hiking for health in utah, as part of utah outdoors, organizes a variety of hikes tailored to promote health and wellness among its members, we call these "welcoming wellness hikes". these wellness hikes are carefully planned to cater to a range of fitness levels, ensuring that everyone, from beginners to more experienced hikers, can participate comfortably and safely. the group's hikes often include easier, flatter trails in scenic areas like the bonneville shoreline trail or the paths around the base of the wasatch range. these trails offer a blend of natural beauty and manageable terrain, ideal for those focusing on improving their health and fitness. the group also organizes regular walks in urban parks and nature reserves, providing opportunities for members to enjoy the outdoors while engaging in moderate physical activity. these hikes are not just about physical exercise; they are designed to be therapeutic, allowing participants to enjoy the fresh air, connect with nature, and relieve stress.
in addition to the easier trails, "hiking for health in utah" occasionally plans more challenging hikes, aimed at those looking to push their fitness boundaries. these hikes might include more elevation gain and rugged terrain, offering a more strenuous workout and the chance to build endurance and strength. destinations such as the trails in mill creek canyon or the ascent to one of the brighton lakes are popular choices, providing both a physical challenge and stunning natural vistas. as a group, we do our best to offer support and guidance, ensuring the safety and comfort of each other. these hikes are not only about physical health but also about building confidence, resilience, and a sense of accomplishment among the members.

healthy hiking
hiking, as a form of exercise and a way to connect with nature, offers a multitude of benefits for both physical and mental health. physically, hiking is a powerful cardiovascular workout that strengthens the heart, lowers blood pressure, and improves overall endurance. the varied terrain of hiking trails promotes the strengthening of different muscle groups, not just in the legs, but also in the core and arms, especially when navigating steep inclines or uneven paths. additionally, hiking aids in weight management, as it can burn a significant number of calories depending on the trailâs difficulty and the hike's duration. the weight-bearing nature of hiking also contributes to building bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis. from a mental health perspective, hiking is equally beneficial. the act of walking in nature has been shown to decrease stress and anxiety levels, thanks to the calming effects of being outdoors and the release of endorphins, the body's natural mood elevators. hiking offers a chance for mindfulness and meditation, as the focus required to navigate trails can help clear the mind and reduce negative thought patterns. it also presents opportunities for social interaction and community building, which are key components in maintaining mental health. the exposure to sunlight during hikes aids in vitamin d production, crucial for bone health and mood regulation. moreover, spending time in nature has been linked to improved cognitive function, creativity, and concentration. in summary, hiking is a holistic activity that nurtures our physical health by improving our strength, endurance, and cardiovascular fitness, while also serving as a potent tool for mental well-being, stress reduction, and fostering a sense of peace and contentment.
