2 feb 11 update:  all good things must come to an end... or do they?  after rd jim
    announced his "retirement" as race director, many mournful wakely
    fans expressed interest in keeping the wakely tradition alive.  well
    we're glad to say that while this damn wakely dam ultra may have come
    to an end after a 10 year run, the wakely tradition will live on under the
    leadership of doug
    and kim gardner.  please join me in
    wishing kim and doug all the best of luck in their new roles as rd.

    to get the latest scuttlebutt. 

please stay tuned to this website which will live on to
    preserve the wakely history and occasionally report on the new event and
    other adirondack adventures.
take a trip back in time and see some of the old wakely
    home pages through the magic of the wayback
    machine.




 





what was it all about?
2001 - 2010:  the damn wakely dam ultra was a trail run through the adirondack park wilderness
of new york state along a remote and uninterrupted section of the
northville
placid trial between piseco lake and wakely dam.  there are no
cross roads. 
there were no aid stations.  runners were prepared to complete the entire 32.6 miles (52.5k) of rugged
technical trail unassisted.  it's was just them, the trail and
the company of like-minded runners.
 those of you with broadband
connections (or
lots of patience) will enjoy the many photos and video
from previous year's runs - many taken on the course showing off the
beauty of the adirondack setting. 
 the original run took place on the 2nd to last saturday from 2001
      through 2010.

you can still run to the dam, the trail isn't going anywhere.  the
adirondacks are a beautiful place but can be unforgiving to those
who do not respect the potential dangers. it's wise to be
prepared.  by familiarizing yourself with the course and the
information provided in this website,
you'll increase your chances of having a
great run!  remember,  there are no dnf's when you're
running to the
dam. ... unless you get carried out!

 laws of
nature:  this was not your average run. runners understood the training required
and
accepted the risks associated with extreme endurance events.  it was understood and accepted that anyone participating in this event
      were acting
strictly on their own initiative and were solely liable for their
actions and any
resulting consequences, injuries and/or damages.  you've
seen this stuff before but we had to say it. (see
lawyers.)
