1.5 million psychometric tests administered globally over 600+ organisations








we enable individuals, teams and organisations to learn, develop and change.
our highly experienced consultants use a wide range of approaches, techniques and assessments both from our own product range and from the best of what is available.
we do not use tests as ways to label, categorise and constrain people but as models for understanding and enabling people to develop their own talent and to build better relationships.

organisational consultancy
culture is the most important thing to get right. it is an essential part of all organisations. culture defines the motivation for progress, change and success.


learn more










leader transformation
leadership today is tougher than it has ever been. the challenges are more ambiguous and changing and our ‘followers’ are more varied and demanding than ever before.


learn more










team development
what do the best teams do?  they set goals and priorities, they analyse and allocate the work that needs to be done, they ensure that working relationships facilitate performance rather than hinder it.


learn more










relationships & culture change
to remain successful, organisations need to get better at predicting their metaphorical weather.  they need ‘barometers’ to indicate how the culture is changing – or how it is failing to change!


learn more















identity coaching
the quickest way to excellence is to stop stopping ourselves!


learn more










reality coaching
you may have thought you’d heard it all – executive coaching, life coaching, performance coaching and now reality coaching – a process which fills the gap which is often missing from the other approaches.


learn more










performance coaching
using an analogy from it – sometimes you find the bug and fix it. sometimes the bug does not resolve the issue because the programme has several flaws.


learn more










coaching & development
the process of cutting dulls the blade. how to keep your saw sharp.


learn more















bureau service
not trained? need to test someone? let us help you by providing a bureau service. this allows you to harness the power of psychometric tools without the need to undergo specialised training.

sleep consultancy services
we cannot change what we do not know. building awareness and psychoeducation around sleep, well-being and performance is the first step to improving.


learn more










sleep assessments
the last 10 years has seen an exponential increase in wearable technology for assessing sleep. yet, many of the devices are not validated and can result in miss-interpretation of data. we need to do more to help you understand what it all means.


learn more










chronometric tools
we are all different. how we look, how we act, how we think and how we sleep. it is crucial to consider this variation in sleep patterns and body clocks when trying to manage health, well-being and performance. that is why we have been advancing the field of ‘chronometrics’.


learn more










sleep coaching
changing human behaviour is easier said than done, and so many of us settle for insufficient sleep without realising that there is hope. individual or group sleep coaching can be used to develop personalised strategies in order to provide meaningful and long-term behavioural change.

our approach



founded in 1989 and specialising in business psychology, team focus limited (tfl) combined applying psychology to business in its assessment and development work with becoming one of the leading trainers in psychometric testing. 
closely involved in the development of the standards for training advocated by the british psychological society (bps), we quickly built a reputation for independence and rigour.
today we offer one of the widest range of training programmes in the major personality questionnaires and are now recognised test publishers offering our own series of tests and questionnaires branded under profiling for success.
