dussault's career in music is more or less his 
                                    destiny as opposed to a vocational choice. he 
                                    was born the son of a bass playing father who 
                                    experienced some success in the musically fertile 
                                    1960's. colin's father artie played bass in several 
                                    of the top groups that worked in and around cleveland 
                                    in the late 1960's & early 1970's. in addition 
                                    to the crawling group and the blackwelles his 
                                    father worked in the united 
                                      artist records recording group audi-badoo which featured members of the aforementioned bands 
                                    in addition to former members of the tree stumps.
growing up colin spent much of his time listening 
                                    to his father's vast record collection while building 
                                    an impressive audio library of his own. while 
                                    doing so he was exposed to and absorbed a myraid 
                                    of musical styles. his musical influences range 
                                    from blind willie mctell, muddy waters, and little 
                                    walter to country joe and the fish, the youngbloods, 
                                    woody guthrie, doc watson, cream, the beatles, 
                                    bob dylan, the rolling stones, led zeppelin, frank 
                                    zappa, the left banke, buffalo springfield and 
                                    lyle lovett.


                                    in the time since the band's inception on colin's 
                                    19th birthday in 1989, colin dussault's blues 
                                    project has played literally thousands of shows

                                      schedule has prompted more than one reviewer to call colin "the hardest working blues 
                                    man in cleveland."

                                    while maintaining an impressive list of local

                                    nights per week, he and his band have also shared
