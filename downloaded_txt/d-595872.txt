cutter suction dredgesdurability and innovative technology 
vmiâs portable cutter suction dredges are the industry standard for large scale production projects! whether dredging sand and gravel, deepening channels and canals or reclaiming land due to erosion. our machines feature a unique rack and pinion spud drive system that provides power both up and down giving the operator the option to force the spuds into the material below to hold their position. while the free-floating spud option accounts for changing water levels while the dredge is unmanned.

vmi horizontal cutter head dredges 
vmiâs horizontal mini-dredge dredges are the industry choice when it comes to industrial ponds, mining retention ponds, marinas, lakes, ponds, and lagoon dredging. our dredge pump features a recessed impeller design for maximum particle passage, entrained gasses and heavy, viscous slurries. vmiâs patented full-width, flow-through cutterhead design provides optimized torque along with variable speed control for maximum material uptake and minimal turbidity.






cable driven horizontal cutter head dredges
when you want maximum production and control, cable driven is the golden standard for dredgers around the world. no other propulsion system gives you the ability to get into a compacted material and stay there like a cable drive. 







self-propelled horizontal cutter head dredges
when you need maximum versatility, having the option of a self-propelled dredge is as versatile as it gets. typically reserved for less compacted materials due to its limited ability to dig with the force or its cable counterpart, these machines can be outfitted with a cable-drive backup.
