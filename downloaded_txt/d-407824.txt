doxo bill payment warning








doxo is a third-party online bill payment website that allows the general public to pay bills online through the doxo website. michigan basic property insurance association does not endorse doxo or any information on doxo’s sites. doxo is an independent entity and michigan basic property insurance association does not control or endorse them, has no contract with them, and is not affiliated with them in any way, nor can michigan basic property insurance association accept any responsibility for transactions conducted through doxo.

doxo’s on-line bill payment website may appear to be affiliated with michigan basic property insurance association, but it is not. "doxo.com" may charge extra fees, and michigan basic property insurance association cannot control when michigan basic property insurance association will receive payments from doxo.com, possibly resulting in late payment penalties or fees or other issues due to non-payment. therefore, michigan basic property insurance association advises customers who wish to utilize online bill pay to only make online payments utilizing the “make a payment online” function on our direct michigan basic property insurance association website.
