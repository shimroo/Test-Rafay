testimonials

we booked a sailboat with a local massachusetts broker and were informed a week before the charter that the sailboat was not available and she had no replacement. we were highly disappointed as my dad, brother and father in law were flying in from across the country to sail for a week. i went on-line and found bareboat sailing charters-newport. brian was most accommodating and a pleasure to work with. he was able to offer us a jeanneau 49â deck salon. the boat was well equipped with many options that included (3) color gps chart plotters and a 10â dinghy. the 20 minute virtual tour video of the boat was great and allowed us to get familiar with the boat and its systems prior to beginning of our sailing adventure. we now have wonderful memories with my family sailing to the islands of cuttyhunk, marthaâs vineyard & nantucket. looking forward to our next charter with brian @ bareboat sailing charters. many thanks from alex and family!!
alexmy husband and i chartered a beneteau 45′ for a week long trip to mv and nantucket, and hired captain scott. we own the same boat on the great lakes and wanted to get experience sailing in new england. our boat was clean and in tip-top condition. scott was an invaluable instructor and our navigational skills improved immeasurably. the entire experience exceeded our expectations (sun every day helped!) i would not hesitate to recommend bareboat sailing charters.
tracywe have chartered many, many times (since 1985) from bareboat sailing charters in newport. great boat with great weekly charter prices. the boat was well maintained and all systems were highly functioning. the boat was well equipped with many options that included (2) color gps chart plotters and a 10â dinghy. the 20 minute virtual tour video of the boat was great. after watching it, you feel like you already know the boat and its technology upon boarding. thanks, bareboat sailing charters for a memorable vacation!
daniela dream come true for captain and crew!  the jenneau 439 we chartered from bareboat sailing was comfortable and perfectly suited for our group. the boat was well equipped and in great working conditon when we boarded. we spent the next 6 days bopping port to port around the elizabeth islands and martha’s vineyard. bareboat sailings crew made everything easy for first timers in that area. we’ll be back next year!
chip“what a fantastic vacation”. we just returned from a wonderful vacation aboard the beneteau 45 we chartered. there were two families onboard, but with 4 cabins there was plenty of room for everyone. the boat was equipped with all the electronics we could need and the chart plotter was especially useful during our week. the best part of the boat, according to my kids, was the hydraulic transom that lowered to create a great swim platform. will charter again and again.
wendywe rented july a jeanneau 439 for 3 weeks to sail from newport to new york and back. this long dream became really true. and thanks to brian we were excellent prepared by several books, maps and most important by a super maintained ship equipped with everything we needed. i charted already boats all over the world, but here both the check-in and check-out was the easiest and fastest ever. thanks for this great time!
karlâliving the dream!â my friends and i just booked our first charter with from bareboat sailing charters to nantucket last week. the boat was well maintained and all systems were functioning. the boat was well equipped with many options that included (2) color gps chart plotters and a 10â dinghy. the 20 minute virtual tour video of the boat was great. after watching it, you feel like you already know the boat & electronic when you board.  chalk up another great sailing vacation!!!
johnthis is my 5th time chartering through bareboat sailing.  the boats are the best maintained of any i have chartered and i have been doing this for about 12 years.  the checkouts and support from brian and his crew are second to none.  the boats are very well equipped, including chart plotters and radar.  they also come with a dinghy and outboard.  like the boats they are always in good order…not necessarily a given in the charter industry.  simply put, bareboat is one of the most professional organizations i have dealt with and i look i forward to many more trips with them in the future.

this outfit and the people behind are absolutely fantastic. i have chartered from them every year for the last 10-years and each time my expectations are far exceeded. the boats are always in excellent condition (with a noticeable and very well received emphasis on safety), the service and help we get along the way from brian and his staff always goes above and beyond, and the area / region  is not to be beat. you are virtually guaranteed to have a terrific experience if you choose bareboat sailing charters.
