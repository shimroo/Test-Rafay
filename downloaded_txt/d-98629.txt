welcome to our new website!
mettec has been manufacturing titanium fasteners for amost 30 years. our inventory has grown to one of north america's largest stocked supply of titanium fasteners. much effort has gone into building our new webpage to make searching for specific bolts and nuts easier to find. if you do not find what you are looking for please contact us at info@mettec.com and let us help you find what you need.quality manufacturingmettec specializes in manufacturing aircraft grade bolts from titanium alloy.  while there are many different grades of titanium, mettec purchases bar material that meets ams and astm standards.  titanium is very process-sensitive, and it is important to use correct fabrication and machining procedures to yield the proper grain structure (for more info see our technical info and faq pages). one of the outstanding benefits of mettec bolts is that we forge the heads and roll the threads for superior strength and to reduce galling. some titanium fastener manufacturers machine their fasteners from bar stock, resulting in inferior products. when you purchase mettec products you will see firsthand the unsurpassed journeyman quality in each part.
