reviews and comments




beautiful lodge

			 beautiful lodge for a large family or group. very spacious! would definitely stay there again. we loved the large farmhouse table. great for meals and board games. each of the 5 bedrooms had its own bathroom which was awesome. the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. having two coffee pots was a big plus in the morning. loved that the shuttle from buffalo river float service came and picked us up and took us back to the lodge.
 sitting on the porch with family priceless ❤️❤️
 bottom line, our family had an amazing time and would stay there again❤️

			 the house had all the space that we needed. our family enjoyed having room to spread out. each bedroom has its own bathroom so no one had to share! the furnishings are starting to show their age however everything was functional. the buffalo river is a short drive away.
