back in the saddle





how easy to fall off creative writing, expressive writing, to settle for single sentence flashes, maybe 160-character text messages. i feel the gap in my life though, so blogging seems in order. my life still has not recovered from the end of my marriage, but i need it to, as soon as possible. i find some moments of happiness a few times every week, but the rest is dread and worry. h.p. lovecraft passages keep slithering into my mind, about days in darkness, huge slimy stairs, gibbering demons, and cliffs to climb. there must be a way into my life that feels alright, but my vision has grown dim.my children still shower me with good love, my family is kind to me, and most of my friends tolerate my pro-longed somberness, so i am grateful to them.

winter now





winter now and all the clouds do fly. winter now as i awaken by and by. water calls me dreams of spring, winter whispers no relief. four hours a week i see my children, hope to increase that soon. hope to live to joy and freedom, past this thick wall of vengeance.

little things





the daylight, the moonlight, the cars between the lines all spin me adrift. my resilient children liven me up like nothing else, but spirits fall when our short visits end, such are separations in this beautiful cruel world. turns out 10,000 oceans of tears ain't really that many, that i didn't know what i was getting into, that sorrow cuts deeper than imagination foresaw. laughing away nightmares has become difficult, dusk seems more a scary movie than ever. thought this post might pump me up, help me project a positive vibration, but more work required.

november and my heart hurts





chest pain is no fun. been a long time since i've felt it, but i feel it now, in this dark november. this fear will lose hold of me in time, one way or another. see all the relatively relaxed people that used to seem relatively glum. transform, transcend, trans-something, take a deep breath. not all is well, nor hell. another deep breath. for the love of me, us all.

growing pain





wish to uplift, but i'm a bummer, most all the time. had so many years of regularly feeling good, at least at some point each day or week, and felt fabolous beyond compare for many of those times. will i ever get that ever new bliss back? still believe in finding fulfillment in the now, which is why these words appear on this screen. want the light to fill me, consume me, shine all around me, like it is. too blind to see it. "that's not the electric light, it's just your vision growing dim." --l. cohen. i see now why men perish after losing their families and money, harder than they could have imagined, emotionally honest or not. of course, the october country has left us to deep autumn, the helladaze season, the frosty dying season. must learn from then let go of past mistakes, work to feel light, remember to eat. bless my friends and family for continuing to put up with me, believing that i'll come in around in awhile like a guy with a hangover sipping coffee.

keeping it together, to dream happy





good feelings drift out there, under the waves, along those long country roads, in the soothing tones of friends voices. harvesting growth and simple joys i listen to the spin of tires, songs of birds and crickets, sounds of the woods at night. the pains of mind and body make their endless circuit around me, coming and going, and looming large then small in comparison. sleep blesses me with happy dreams sometimes, challenges me with stressful nightmares others. i just went from the grapes of wrath into tobacco road. the book's not as funny as the movie, but it helps the time pass in an oddly uplifting way. been seeing my kids three times/week for awhile now. i would like to spend vastly more time than that ~10-hours or less with them, but it appears that for awhile i will see them even less. life passes both quickly and slowly, but our visits end too soon. i see that they will join me ever again as long as i maintain my health and wits and life energy. that means working, excercising, sleeping, meditating, and eating with as much vim as i can muster. all those things are precious, and help me remain present for the next time with my darlings, not just my kids but all the wonderful people in my circle of love.
