about us & doula bios




































our philosophy











we believe what families need most is nurturing and gentle support. we believe that each pregnancy, labor and birth is a unique and miraculous experience and the emerging family is the center and focus of that experience. we believe that each family should choose for themselves where they feel safe giving birth, who they want to receive their baby, what friends and family will be present and whether they want to use pain medications or other medical interventions or not.  we believe that expectant mothers should be provided education and information so she and her partner can make informed decisions regarding their options, as well as any risks, benefits and or precautions. once your baby is born, we believe that if your needs are met you can meet your baby's needs and it is our goal to be the bridge that gently closes the gap between birth and parenthood.
