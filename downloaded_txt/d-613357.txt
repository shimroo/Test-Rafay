cards of encouragement is a popular, well-established range of christian greetings cards that gospel cards acquired in 2019. most of the cards are different from traditional christian greetings cards in that they prominently display bible verses on the front of the cards, thereby blessing everyone who sees the card displayed, without having to open it. the complete range is now included on our website.

we now have easy-to-use "paypal" as an option to pay for online orders. 

10% of the proceeds from the sale of christmas cards will be passed on to the 18 christian charities that we support (please see the beneficiaries page for details). 

thank you for supporting their invaluable work in this way.

please join us in praying that the cards and gifts that are bought will be a great help and encouragement to all who receive them - thank you.

ps: our returns policy
our cards, calendars, etc. are produced to the highest possible standard within each price range. similarly, the contents and production quality of the items we buy in from other publishers is very high. however, in the unlikely event that you are not 100% satisfied with anything you order, simply return it to us within 14 days for a full refund of cost plus postage.
 




delivery times
our standard service (â£4.99) currently aims to dispatch orders to you within 7 - 14 working days. however, we are also giving you the option of a priority service (â£7.99) for uk orders, where they will be dispatched within 2 working days by 1st class mail, or the parcel equivalent. the store check-out defaults to the standard service, so please select priority service if you require your order in a hurry - thanks.
all overseas orders are sent by airmail (cost â£7.99 plus approximately 40% of the cost of the order). nb: deliveries to overseas countries are likely to be subject to import duties, etc that are payable by the customer.
