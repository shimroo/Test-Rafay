hello all,i am very sorry i have not posted in so long. i have just been trying to keep it all together.i am now back to work (thank god) i must have sent out 100 resumes since january 08.don't get me wrong i love being off with my children, but disability is not enough to live on, all annuity's, pension's and savings are gone, so off to work i go i hope i can keep it up.the divorce is final, the last few months were very trying!i also experienced a couple of week's of extreme abdominal pain i thought might be the cancer, it turned out, (by no help from doctors) that when i was in china for my transplant they were unable to put the gallbladder in me. so i should have been on a special diet, thanks so much u.s. doctors for not reading the post transplant manuscript from the chinese doctor's.so no more bacon, greasy foods, cheese thing's like that.i still get many people corresponding with me re: transplants for themselves or there loved one's and the most common question is how to go to china to do it, and unfortunately i have to tell them that china has halted all foreign transplants, but there are still option's, anyone needing help should contact me either here or my personal e-mail eric_g_deleon@sbcglobal.netthe kid's are on summer vacation now and are well we are going to do all we can to have fun with each other this summer.i will try to post more often in the future

happy new year everybody...well it's jan, 1st 2008 and i for one am glad 2007 is gone, overall 07 did not turn out all that well for me. it seemed to me most of the people i spoke with did not have a great year.i know buissness was slow, at least in the construction area, i must have sent out at least 100 resume's and only got a couple of offers, i got laid off on 6/01/07 and went on sdi untill i landed a job in sep 9/15/07 which only lasted 4.5 weeks (demo only) and found myself off again in oct 10/15/07, and it took 8 week's of dealing with sdi to reinstate me on my perminent dissability status, i was allmost on the streets. realy!well with that behind me i am going to keep a posative attitude in 2008 it may start a little slow but i'm shure it will finish with a bang!the kid's are doing great, and had a wonderful christmas dominic is going back to school (st timothy's) tomorrow 01/02/08 and samantha is looking forward to starting school in september.my health is well and i fell great, i will go for a ct scan in feb, but i can tell you the results, my cancer is going away, so i can live on for another day.i thank all of for all your support throught these trying times. and may god bless you as he has me.also a special thanks to the unknown donor.p.s.dovchik,i wrote you re: your condition but it didn't go through, i will try another way, but if it does not go, can you write me and explain the (psc) liver condition i will try to help in any way i can   have a great 2008 and stay possative, love you alleric de leon

hi everyone,i have to apologize for not posting for so long.as most of you know i am going through a divorce, and am not working right now, so most of my time is spent on sending resumes out and going to mediation's, court,doctors app ts, and raising my children which live primarily with me.i feel great and my cancer is stable, i still keep my positive attitude no matter what  happens i will not give up on my family and friends.i spoke to an anonymous blogger this afternoon re: his brother whom has liver problems and i hope i was of some help.i have been on national geographic explorer recently and i think it will air again soon, i am trying to find out now, they did not tell me about the airing,i did the interview about 2 months ago.i am enjoying the time i am spending with my children and hope they will always cherish.the moore obstacles i overcome the stronger i become , they say it builds character,well i must be some character, i will not give up!!!!!! and hope others that read this will gain strength to overcome there obstacles.i try ed a new cancer drug called nevermar it made my hands and feet peel the skin was just coming off it was a little pain full so i had to stop it. that's ok there are other drugs, if they ever get out of the fda, i think the most powerful healing is being positive and not being scared.i write almost everyday " i don't have cancer, i don't have cancer" 100 times it seems to help.in closing i love you all for all your support and hope you all have happy holiday's, and may god bless you, as he has for me.also the book sale's are low, it may make a good gift for someone, the proceeds go into an account for the kid's collage education, in case i am not here, (dought that) .love to alleric
