diana pumpelly bates: unity revolution 
the natalie and james thompson art gallery is pleased to present "diana pumpelly bates:
                                    unity revolution" curated by bridget r. cooks.
                                    
                                    known for her bronze sculptures and metal public art visible throughout northern california,
                                    diana pumpelly bates, (ma 1987, mfa 1989) began her career as a painter and printmaker.
                                    in the 1960s, she explored themes of unity, beauty, and family in large-scale canvases
                                    and small prints. pumpelly bates’ curious forms express movement and energy. the unique,
                                    two-toned, chromatic pairing in each composition offers vibrations of color. from
                                    a distance, the silhouetted shapes appear as single forms. a closer look shows multiple
                                    elements united to make a whole. based on her experiences of family formations and
                                    interpersonal relationships, bates considers each painting a combination of the codes,
                                    secrets, impressions, nonsense, and beauty which life has given her.
