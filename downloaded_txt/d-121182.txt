different by design
see lab's unique approach











est. 1967

our students have been turning their differences into advantages for more than 50 years.



200

faculty and staff members. all our teachers are specialists in learning differences.





college-ready. career-ready. lab grads leave equipped with skills for whatever comes next.



385

students learn, explore, and create at lab each day.








four divisions. one mission: turning differences into advantages.


the lab difference











lower school
students “learn how to learn” through hands-on projects and small-group collaboration that are designed to tap their intellectual curiosity.


























middle school
students learn to apply their academic skills, embrace a higher level of independence, and engage in arts-centered, project-based learning in all subjects.


























upper school
students build on their strengths and passions, embrace leadership opportunities, and develop strategies to tackle what’s challenging.


























global division
if you live outside of the washington dc area, without access to a high quality intervention program for children with dyslexia, adhd and other language based learning differences…our global division may be just what you are looking for!

lab news

contemplations from kim: the purpose of school
before we can learn something, we have to acknowledge that we have something to learn. we have to bump up against the realization of “i don’t know.” and, the moment of “i don’t know” is usually uncomfortable.







today is world dyslexia day
date

10/8/2024

summary

october is also dyslexia and adhd awareness month. lab is focused on creating a more inclusive world for those with dyslexia and shifting the conversation from it being a deficit to a strength!
