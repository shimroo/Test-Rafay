    2024 financial reports


 november 22, 2024

november 8, 2024                                                                                                            dear parishioners of sacred heart parish,                                                                                                            as is the practice to promote transparency within the church, i present to you this year’s financial report. the staff, members of the finance council, and the archdiocese have been helpful in preparing it. if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me directly or speak to one of the council members.                                                                                                            there is good news and bad news to convey to you. while overall mass attendance is climbing thanks to the addition of another spanish liturgy on saturday evenings at 7:00pm and our offertory is up over ranging from 4%-15% when compared to the same week last year, we are still running at a substantial deficit. in recent weeks, we have eliminated a staff position, cut back on weekend office hours, and household expenses. the reality is that we are relying upon parish savings to operate, and our expenses far outweigh our income. it is just like running a household, and it is not financially feasible for our future for the drain to continue at this rate.                                                                                                            as has been the case in the last two years, you will be hearing how we can all support a spiritual home within the next few weeks. i ask that you begin to discern in your heart how you will help sacred heart this next year.                                                                                                            gratefully yours in christ,                                                                                                            father brian clary                                                                  pastor                                                                                                                                                                  parish finance report 2024                                                      school finance report 2024

 




   

    inspiring hope campaign update


 june 22, 2024

elevators are now available for those in need, and there will likely be a blessing mass on september 8, 2024.                                    please help pay for them by following these instructions.                                                          1. go to                                                                                www.inspiringhopecampaign.org                                                      2. click on “donate”                                                      3. select designation: educating and inspiring our children                                                                                     4. select parish credit: sacred heart, roslindale                                                                                                      note from fr. brian clary, july 21, 2024                                                                                             elevators are now functioning for those who are in genuine need. please note that the elevator moves very slowly. when you get to the desired floor, it will take a few seconds for the door to open. please be patient. thank you. the improvements to the lower church have been quite welcome although some have commented on the reconciliation room not being soundproof enough. the confessor will have to be aware that his voice carries. whenever i am in a new space it takes awhile to get used to the acoustics. one solution would be to add more soundproof padding inside and/or have a white noise machine outside which are commonly found in psychotherapy offices.                                                                                also, we may consider adding some curtains to the windows to preserve the anonymity of the penitent. however, the challenge is that there are those who have not kept up with their pledges along with added expenses have left us with a substantial deficit which will be absorbed by a loan from the archdiocese. the finance council and i would like to avoid carrying that debt especially when there were good faith pledges made several years ago to have this project completed. we understand that a number of factors have played a role in the shortfall: ones financial situation may not be ideal at this time to fulfill the pledge; a donor may have moved from the parish or has died. if you can help us deter- mine whether or not a specific pledge will be honored please let us know so we can plan accordingly.                                                                       note from fr. brian clary,  june 18, 2024                                                          the elevator will be inspected on june 24th and then will need a final sign off from the contractor. we expect to have use of it by early july. at that point weekday masses will resume in the lower church and access to the front entrance. bathrooms are functioning but there have been a couple of mishaps already. please be courteous in using the toilets and the trash receptacles.                                     also, saturday confessions will now be heard in the reconciliation room located on the cummins highway side of the lower church. this is truly good news.                                     however, the challenge is that there are those who have not kept up with their pledges along with added expenses have left us with a substantial deficit which will be absorbed by a loan from the archdiocese.                                     the finance council and i would like to avoid carrying that debt especially when there were good faith pledges made several years ago to have this project completed. we understand that a number of factors have played a role in the shortfall: one’s financial situation may not be ideal at this time to fulfill the pledge;
