about the shaggin wagon 

the shaggin’ wagon is a 1988 ford e150 econoline conversion van with a 5.0 liter fuel injected engine.  it is used for wv football tailgating.

the shaggin’ wagon got its start in 2003 when it was purchased for the princely sum of $1,800 cash in virginia.  it was brought to west virginia with the intent of making it into a tailgating vehicle.  here’s a couple of pictures before the custom paint job was added.

the paint scheme was based based on a 1957 chevy.  the idea was to make the top yellow and the bottom blue to better reflect heat and keep the interior cooler.
