vivian instruments
the vivian custom shop was founded in 1995 by the instrument designer and master luthier, jan vlasak, to create fine electric guitars and basses. each instrument is handmade in the czech republic and combines state-of-the-art design and technology with great playability and elegance. but most importantly, we understand the difference the right instrument will make to you because we are more than a musical company, we're guitar and bass players, too
