music: chris rock stand up mp4my sister is having another baby as we speak... woo... it's so wierd and beautiful about how life is brought about in this life it makes you cherish every single birth around the world all at once.  with so much suffering, pain, and death... why focus on that?  you'll be stuck in a world of suffering, instead of living life for the beauty of nature and the human element.

music: rob zombie - dragulaa little poem i wrote after watching queen of the damned! >:d  all by myself... pfft...return to the dorment and withdraw your essence, as i latch to your throat and create a sole presence, relinquish a scream that vanishes as it protrudes,for the undead inside me has begun to intrude.beware of it, if it's awakenedthink you are safe, you are mistaken,even in death my hunger feasts at your soul,now count down your seconds, sucking blood from these holes.veins and arteries combust on my bite,i walk through the darkness to avoid all the light,darkness surround me, i'm drowning in sin,as i give into the cravings of the darkness within.
