        journal of antiques. there is an on line version on their website.




 a
        little more about us:
our names are antigone and joseph.
we value and try to preserve original finishes
and condition.
we also deal in stringed instruments:-
lutes,
mandolins, classical guitars, and 'uds (ouds /arabic lute).
by avoiding the high overheads and crowds of the
popular antique centers we can offer buyers quality stock at reasonable
prices. 
we can ship items anywhere in the world using
federal express.  many destinations can be next day. 
for more shipping information see
terms of business. 

joseph will undertake restoration  or conservation
of museum quality early stringed instruments. reports on conservation,
care and historical background can also be undertaken in conjunction with
restoration/conservation work.
 joseph has been a maker
(lute 'ud and guitar)/dealer/conservator
of  plucked string instruments for over twenty five years and his workshop (same address)
is included on the register of conservators maintained by the conservation
unit of the museums and galleries commission.
antigone has been dealing in boxes for over twenty
five years.  she started the well known "box shop" which was located
at camden passage. she has examined boxes as a collector, dealer, advisor,
cataloguer and conservator and writer.
in the hope that her many years of experience
will offer some guidance both to collectors and to people who wish to use
beautiful things as a way of enhancing their environment, antigone has
now published a selection of her
box notes on the internet and the book. 
this site is still under construction
(and probably always will be) and new
illustrations and information will be added continually as time permits.  new
articles will be added, as they are prepared.
