                nice spacious restaurant with bar.  had a good level of illumination. not too bright, not too dark. waiter was prompt and courteous. food was worth the wait. had plenty of tvs to watch the game while you eat etc. but not over filled like a sports bar.

                this is my favourite place of its kind in the st. louis area. great fries, reuben, burgers, and 30 plus taps (where else could you get elysian space dust ipa on tap?!). family friendly!

                our server mikey was great. he was friendly, accommodating, and attentive. the food was delicious. i had the adult grilled cheese with bacon added, my wife had the chicken club sandwich, and of course we had to try the house chips with garlic ranch.

                great place for dinner. we’re new parents with a 1 year old. we met up with our friends here for dinner and took him with us. this is a family friendly pub, they even had high chairs. little guy loved the fruit and we all had a great dinner and a good time. service was great too. would recommend for all ages.
