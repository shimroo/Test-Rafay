crushed by a million pressures

the youth mental health crisis isn’t caused by one thing. it’s a million tiny things that add up.


we're calling on the government to fulfil their manifesto commitments, tackle the systemic issues contributing to the mental health emergency, and stop blaming young people for the challenges they face.

stories from black disabled young people

we know from speaking to disabled young people that they are more disproportionately affected by mental health struggles. that's why we worked together with black disabled young people and content creators to produce content that is honest, real and personal to their experiences.

frequently asked questions








how can youngminds help me?











our website is full of advice and information to give young people the tools to look after their mental health. we empower parents and professionals to be the best support they can be to the young people in their lives. and we give young people the space and confidence to get their voices heard and change the world we live in. together, we can create a world where no young person feels alone with their mental health.
find out more about our work and impact. 










what is mental health?











we all have mental health, just like we all have physical health. it’s about how we think, feel and act. sometimes we feel well, and sometimes we don’t. when our mental health is good, we feel motivated and able to take on challenges and new experiences. but when our mental health is not so good, we can find it much harder to cope.
find out more about mental health.










how do i know if i have a 'mental health problem'?











we all have good days and bad days, but when negative thoughts and feelings start to affect your daily life and stop you doing the things you enjoy, or your ability to feel okay, this means you need support with your mental health. for example, nearly everyone gets anxious before an exam, a job interview or a first date. but if you feel anxious all the time and this is stopping you from sleeping well or meeting up with friends, you might need help.
find out more about mental health conditions.










is youngminds part of camhs?











no, we’re not part of child and adolescent mental health services (camhs). we're a charity that offers information and advice to young people, parents and carers. check out our guide to support which covers how camhs work, how you can get help from camhs, what happens at an assessment, what your rights are and more. we do not offer one-to-one support for camhs assessments, treatments or complaints.
if you're a parent or carer, find information about accessing camhs and other services on our getting support from mental health services page. or contact our parents helpline for more advice.
find out more about camhs.










how do you help parents?











we help parents and carers who are worried about their child’s mental health with tips, information and advice online and through our parents helpline service. use our parent helpfinder to find the right support for you.










what support do you provide to adults working in the community?











whether you work at a youth club, coach a sports team, or run extra-curricular activities outside of school, we know the positive and crucial role you play in the lives of young people. we have information, tips and resources for you to feel confident when responding to a young person's wellbeing needs.
