vdo autodiagnos check (end of life)




overview


functions




























why make things complicated when they should be easy?
connect, start, go! for the first time, continental has applied the self-operating principle known from computer technology to garage processes. in doing so, it has created a completely new product category: plug & play service.
this solution simplifies everyday service activities across all manufacturers. garages can operate more efficiently and the strain is taken off mechanics. this is because complex applications run mostly by themselves.
please note that the end of support for the product in question has been reached and the product is no longer sold or supported.
