happy 50th birthday, statocaster




my strat turns 50 today. she's been with me since '76 or so. came to me as a literal basket case, she'd been torn down for a refinish so it was weeks of work before i could put strings on her and make music for the first time.

clarke, on age and wisdom.


“if an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible he is almost certainly right, but if he says that it is impossible he is very probably wrong.” — arthur c. clarke
“when, however, the lay public rallies around an idea that is denounced by distinguished but elderly scientists and supports that idea with great fervor and emotion — the distinguished but elderly scientists are then, after all, probably right.” — isaac asimov


there's probably something to add here about fox news and the wall street journal.  — jpalmer
