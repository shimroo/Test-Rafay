"if there is no struggle, there is no progress. those who profess to  favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. they want rain without thunder and  lightning. they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many  waters. this struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle. power  concedes nothing without a demand. it never did and it never will. find  out just what a people will submit to, and you have found out the exact  amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and  these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows,  or with both. the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of  those whom they oppress." - frederick douglass
