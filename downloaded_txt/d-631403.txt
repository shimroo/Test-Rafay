miles west from central london

the centre of london is generally taken to be charing cross, specifically the statue of charles i in the middle of the roundabout. i've visited the points one mile due west, then two miles, then three miles, all the way up to ten miles, to see how london changes the further west you go. [map]

one mile west: audley square, mayfair
(on south audley street, behind the dorchester)


mayfair is a different world. its streets are old and narrow, and plied by a better class of vehicle. five consecutive taxis drive towards me along south audley street, which i suspect isn't in any way abnormal. one drops off a headscarved woman outside the embassy of the state of qatar, where the doorman checks she has appropriate business to be allowed inside. across the road is a merc with diplomatic plates, and another with the personalised registration qtr 1 (the first letter of which must've involved some high-level string-pulling). yet another merc is parked up round the corner with a chauffeur at its wheel, awaiting the call to action.

most of the men who walk by are middle-aged, wearing suits in fractionally different shades of blue. one couple are carrying a property portfolio. the handsome sandstone building at number 2 audley square, with the cornucopia relief, has been owned by the university women's club since 1921. a union jack is wrapped several times around its flagpole. the sash-windowed townhouse nextdoor at number 3 is perfectly presented, and conceals a luxury 5-bed dwelling with knockthroughs and basement swimming pool behind its flawless facade. but number 4 is missing, as are the former 5, 6 and 7, because the remainder of audley square is a levelled demolition site behind a wall of blue hoardings.

what's been taken down is a public multi-storey car park inserted in 1962 and the disused petrol filling station behind, to make way for "the finest residential apartment building (and facilities) ever built in mayfair and in the wider london area". the billionaire speculator making this massive boast is john caudwell, former owner of phones4u, whose snail's pace project was only given the go-ahead when he agreed to build some affordable housing three streets away in a former street-sweeping depot. he bought the site for £155m, but hopes to flog the three penthouses for £100m each, which should make the lower 27 apartments pure profit. one mile from the centre of london, a whole lot of shenanigans are going on.

two miles west: kensington gardens
(on the banks of the long water)


here's a lovely spot in kensington gardens you might just know, the first waterside vista to the south of the peter pan statue. kensington palace is to the west, on a sightline behind the physical energy statue, while henry moore's 37 ton arch lies immediately across the lake. you may know it as the serpentine, but officially this end is the long water. pleasureboat-free, it's the sanctuary waterfowl prefer. one gull has perched on each of the wooden posts along the water's edge. two swans glide by. a moorhen disappears with a ripple.

the footpath is busy, with tourists and hire bikes and over-bellied joggers. one well-prepared party pauses to scatter crumbs on the ground, which is the signal for avian scrutineers to hotfoot over. the air is briefly full of ducks. several geese hop out of the water. all but three of the wooden posts are now empty. the crumb-sower whips out his phone to grab the photo he wanted, beaming to camera, than quickly walks on. the geese progress further onto the lawn, where an entwined couple are finishing off a treat from the hummingbird bakery, surrounding them on two flanks. i hope they looked carefully at the grass before they sat down.

a long bench runs down to the water, one of its wooden slats uncomfortably missing. i grab a seat at the far end after a retired couple have departed, and just as a single yellow leaf floats down and lands beside me. the green box which is supposed to contain a lifebelt appears to be empty. two peroni bottle caps lie on the tarmac. a rustic-looking sign urges "no bathing, fishing or dogs permitted in this lake". most of the ducks and geese have had enough of waddling and have returned to the lake. the trees across the water look splendid. nobody else is here because of the precise distance it is from charing cross, but sometimes following the numbers pays off.

three miles west: kensington place, notting hill
(at the junction with hillgate street, w8)


kensington place runs a couple of streets back from notting hill gate, sloping down towards kensington church street, and is nowhere the hoi polloi would normally go. one side is perfect pastel terraces with sash windows, basement steps and prices approaching three million apiece - ideal for purchasers who want reconfigurable internal space with hardly any garden to fuss over. the other side is a school playground, colourfully marked, and a block of brown flats built on the site of a garage on the site of a disused reservoir. the street could have traffic both ways, but folks need to be able to park their mini coupés out front so it has to be one way only.

a kid from the flats speeds down the pavement on his silver scooter, and thanks me ever so politely for stepping to one side. two floppy haired blonds with brogues and barbours walk down the middle of the road, confident of not being run over. some terribly nice vases are on show on parlour tables, unless the shutters are down because there's nothing, or too much, worth ogling. someone in the unpainted stretch has got the scaffolders in. the primary school offers weekend classes in family yoga. a copper-spired church on campden hill dominates the top of the street. the display of autumn colours at number 30 is currently stunning. what a difference a mile makes.

four miles west: westfield london
(i.e. shepherd's bush, not stratford)


four miles west of trafalgar square delivers us to europe's largest shopping mall, within the confines of the retail maelstrom that is westfield london. the specific spot is along the promenade linking the central atrium to the upmarket 'village', where the shops that would never thrive in stratford are clustered. it's lofty, it's spacious, and because i've turned up on a sunday afternoon it's quite busy. those in their 20s and 30s generally have carrier bags in their hands, those in their 40s more likely small children. triangular skylights reveal the outside world shoppers aren't meant to notice. private security personnel keep a careful eye on proceedings.

up on level 1 the mall passes between zara and a boarded up unit, new retailer (hopefully) coming soon. in the centre of the aisle is an 'outdoor' overspill for pret, plus a sushi vendor with fewer, shabbier banquettes. oud milano are offering 50% off their selection of oriental beauty products, this small kiosk their only outlet this side of the alps. a lowly operative wheels over her trolley to empty the litter bin, which is mostly full of empty cups. wave your phone at the qr code on zara's shop window for exclusive details of sales promotions within. the music pumping out from somewhere overhead is so mainstreamly modern that i recognise none of it. 

downstairs, or rather down-escalator, the units are smaller and more fashionable. armani, versace and calvin klein are amongst the famous names bedded in, the latter exclusively for the sale of underwear. i worry that tory burch might be a political faction's hq, but instead its gold shelves are sparsely dotted with not many handbags. one young couple pause to look over the watches and ray-bans slotted into a mid-aisle display. a very patient-looking dad pushes his offspring forwards inside a hired red miniature sports car. another family have hunkered down on some benches and unleashed the kids' packed lunches, spilling crisps and haribo onto the carpet. westfield is their day out, sunday is no day of rest, and once more round and then we'll go home.

five miles west: ollgar close, w12
(where shepherds bush meets acton)


here's dull. we're on the uxbridge road one mile west of westfield, at the point just before hammersmith & fulham morphs into ealing. ollgar house is a 1980s-looking development of three redbrick blocks of flats, the shorter two poking out at right angles from the longest to create square landscaped gardens. it was designed to make better use of the open space behind the shops on the main road, now demolished, and is a resolutely private affair. gates into the estate are padlocked, signs warn interlopers away, and the only access for non-residents is the access road round the back. fortunately for this post, and unfortunately for the reader, that's where the exact five-mile marker falls.

ollgar close starts between a very modern school for autistic children and a tiny cottage offering french polishing expertise, then progresses past a row of lock-ups and a fence covered with obviously fake-foliage. before long it reaches the ugly backside of the longest block of flats, where a handful of parking bays are labelled with signs telling visitors not to park here unless they want a £100 fine. i was trying to work out how on earth residents get up to their flats, there being no stairs, when a lift door opened and the caretaker emerged with a mop and bucket. he wandered off to the plant room, a rumbling chamber of grubby machinery, and i carried on walking towards the shrubbery at the far end like i had some reason to be here. the capital's fourth fatal stabbing of 2018 occurred here when an argument on instagram escalated and a male model was fatally wounded, his killers subsequently jailed for life. private places always look more appealing from the front.

six miles west: cromwell close, w3
(acton, off the high street)


acton's smart and dapper, at least in the slice between churchfield road and the high street. desirable victorian terraces cut through, conveniently located for shops that sell craft beer, vintage clothes and farmhouse cheese. turn off grove road halfway down to find grove place, and turn left off that to enter cromwell close. its residents would rather you didn't because they've slapped private property signs everywhere in an attempt to deter unwanted parking, and in the vain hope that pedestrians won't discover it's a cut-through. these flats are rather newer, the central block resembling a converted mill whereas it's absolutely nothing of the sort. before 1971 this was the site of acton technical college, in its later life a campus of the fledgling brunel university, whose demolition left a hole ripe for redevelopment. no cycling. no ball games. no dumping. cctv in operation. and lots of space for parking.

through a gate on the far side is locarno road, a brief cul-de-sac connecting to the high street. as well as being packed with pizza hut delivery bikes it has two tiny shops, one a barbers and the other an entirely unbranded cafe with space for four chairs outside on a scrap of astroturf. the streetsign high on the wall behind a drooping cable is headed 'borough of acton'. looming across the main road is the clocktower of redbrick acton town hall, as was, deemed surplus to requirements by ealing council and sold off as a valuable asset. the building's now emblazoned with signs advertising 58 luxury apartments, and its marketing suite and showhome are open seven days a week. ealing's housing register contains over 12000 applicants, but priorities post-austerity are somewhat skewed.

seven miles west: ealing common, w5
(gunnersbury avenue, aka north circular road)


when you think of the north circular you think of a drear dual carriageway, but here in ealing it's a narrow tree-lined avenue. no planner ever dared encroach upon the common, or deprive the villas along gunnersbury avenue of their front gardens. these have highly decorated gables crafted with overlapping terracotta tiles, and intricate arched porches that plead with you to come inside. the two houses guarding the entrance to crosslands avenue even have turrets. they're built on the site of ealing common farm, and the estate beyond used to be its orchard. today's residents perch pots of pansies on their gateposts, and drape hosepipes across their front lawns to refresh their rosebushes, and park their mini countrymans beside their bmws, and live out an idyllic thirties suburban dream as if in a quiet corner of chorleywood but in zone 3.

the corner of the common that abuts the north circular is closed to all traffic but bicycles. one bright orange steed has been left propped up beneath a sycamore, this one of the chinese-funded mobike fleet that still attempts to eke out a dockless living across ealing. the common bristles with rich vegetation, grassy stalks and scattered wildflowers. follow the sandy track to a bench where you can watch the delivery lorries go by, or spy the tower of the local parish church, or flop back with a podcast and a wrap. close scrutiny of the horse chestnuts reveals clusters of tiny spiked green cases preparing autumn's conker harvest. beyond the treeline the eid in the park festival is getting underway. best not rush ahead to eight miles too soon.

eight miles west: waldemar avenue, w13
(at the corner of lyncroft gardens)


and briefly to west ealing, a stone's throw from walpole park, amid a web of bucolic edwardian avenues. this is prime middle class territory, mixing palm-fronted properties, redbrick villas and 4-bed semis with the twiddliest of external features. an old garage has been left to fall apart behind a broken fence. gnarled roots erupt repeatedly from the pavement. led bulbs droop from original fluted lampposts. number 10 has thrown several chunks of their back garden into a set of skips. the inaugural ealing art trail takes place next weekend, please take a brochure. sorry, there's little to say about life hereabouts, other than it looks like a lovely place to live.

nine miles west: maunder road, hanwell, w7
(off boston road)


hanwell's a lot older than it looks, and used to be important until ealing overwhelmed it. at its heart is the uxbridge road, and off that a triangular one-way system, and off that the brief dogleg of maunder road. it's been here since victorian times when it ran down to some fields, whereas now it merely dodges the back of lidl. one of its corner shops is occupied by a beauty bar, which is smart by local standards, although looking around that isn't hard because the gentrification whirlwind has yet to hit. the other corner shop belongs to some solicitors, while across the road is a shuttered unit called lookingforbargain.com, a website which probably never existed (and probably never should).

maunder road is "unsuitable for h.g.v.s." according to its street sign, partly because parked cars make it too narrow but mainly because of the sharp bend at the end. twenty terraced houses have been squeezed in along its length, each with barely any garden front or back but still boasting a half-million price tag. only proper hanging baskets grace their frontage, there'll be none of those cheap topiary globes here. most of the houses have a single attic skylight in the centre of the roof, but number 7 has had the builders in to give their extra bedroom some decent width. only one resident has a garage in constant use, and only one a driveway in constant use, neither of which i saw being used. it's all delightfully ordinary, and ever so convenient for crossrail.

ten miles west: great western industrial park, southall ub2
(at the bend in dean way)


if you know the uxbridge road, or indeed the great western railway, we're by the iron bridge. the quirky three bridges, where isambard kingdom brunel slotted a road bridge above an aqueduct above a railway line, is close by. in 1927 this site was chosen by associated daimler co ltd for their new factory, and it's where a.d.c. (soon renamed a.e.c.) spent the next half century manufacturing commercial and passenger vehicles. they specialised in chassis for buses and lorries, plus the occasional artillery tractor, and are perhaps most famous for turning out classic routemaster double deckers. in the 1960s a.e.c. was the largest employer in southall, with a labour force exceeding 5000, but in 1979 british leyland closed it down and the flattened site is now an industrial estate.

great western industrial park is a screwfix, topps tiles and carpet town affair, plus a large matalan to help draw the crowds. but drive fractionally further in and the large grey sheds are less public, mostly warehouses, freight depots and factories for the processing of food. up dean way, where we're heading, two statuesque elephants guard the entrance to noon foods, the heart of a southall entrepreneur's ready meal empire. if you pinged a chicken tikka masala in your microwave during the early years of convenience food it may well have come from here, and the waitrose lorries parked out front suggest business is still hot. across the road we find delifrance, automated manufacturers of artisan bread, whose factory is flanked by tall metal silos and a row of red, white and blue flags. and at the end of the road trains to cardiff can occasionally be seen rushing by, but that's one hundred and thirty miles west and i am very much stopping at ten.

miles south from central london

the centre of london is generally taken to be charing cross, specifically the statue of charles i in the middle of the roundabout. i've visited the points one mile due south, then two miles, then three miles, all the way up to ten miles, to see how london changes the further south you go. [map]

one mile south: john islip street, millbank
(just north of tate britain, by the junction with marsham street)


one road back from millbank, all is quiet. john islip street is a road of two halves divided, roughly at the point where i'm standing, into an unchanged older part and a sleeker modern quarter. the older part includes what looks very much like an atypical council estate, with four parallel blocks named after painters, the exterior perfectly maintained and the courtyard sparkling with potted flowers. across the street is tate britain's administrative building, where the offices are, with a splendid redbrick frontage topped by a sugar-magnate crest. lorries creep in up the side. occasionally a lowly member of staff pushes the binbags out on a trolley.

across the fault line is millbank court, a quintessentially 1970s concrete apartment block with pebbledash inserts, and a first floor lobby extending forwards between granite slabs. it looks the ideal place for a secret agent's liaison - mi5 are based just around the corner - or somewhere a provincial parliamentarian might have their pied à terre. the doubletree hilton is a more recent intrusion, all glass and taxi bay, whose menu looks reasonably priced until you spot the small print saying "dishes are small and designed to share - we recommend three per person".

the pavement outside abell house has been sprayed with red, white and blue marks, including the location of an empty duct. a helicopter flies across. three workmen sit chatting on a gap in the topiary, then move to stand outside a garage door, then disappear. a stream of civil servants and burberry employees drip down from the top of the street. it's not hard to deduce who's who.

two miles south: thorncroft street, sw8
(off wandsworth road, not far from nine elms tube)


thorncroft street is an unremarkable residential road in south lambeth, a few hundred metres in length, its former terraces erased after ww2. their replacements are sturdy multi-storey blocks - dean court, sheldon court and burden house - the latter proudly owned by the church commissioners. given the choice, burden house looks the nicest. you will not be getting into any of their railinged gardens.

we may be only two miles from the centre of london, but owning a car is really popular here. a red corsa arrives, radio pulsing, and manages to find a gap in the parking bay. a young couple emerge, unlock the boot and take out a week's shopping and two cat carriers. another couple have driven back from the gym, with hubby in beach shorts carrying a stuffed lonsdale bag. the cabbie with the light blue taxi drives off so his mate can fill the vacant space with an estate. i smile when i see that the driver of the white van from harvey & brockless, "the fine food co", is stuffing his face with a saucy chicken takeaway. 

luke, the golden retriever, has stopped to be admired by the neighbours. his owner questions what might be stuck around his mouth, then walks very slowly in the direction of sainsbury's. a pink suitcase with a butterfly design has been abandoned on the pavement beside most of an apple. someone has dumped a broken chair next to the bins. finches flock to the feeders on a balcony brightened by tubs of geraniums. an old man limps past the basketball court towards the pub on the corner, the sole building to survive postwar demolition. the nott is an uncomplicated careworn boozer offering chinese cuisine, rock'n'roll on fridays and a night of misspelt halloeen entertainment. for those in need of karaoke, a banner above the door lists elvis's mobile number.

three miles south: cottage grove, clapham
(fenwick estate, nr clapham north station, sw9)


the falcon, with its mustard frontage and beer terrace, is certainly trendy enough for clapham. but cottage grove alongside is the gateway to a dead end council estate, knocked up in the 1960s and hidden away beside the railway embankment. the fenwick estate, a loop of courtyard and linear blocks, has seen better days. the vehicle testing station on the way in is a big clue, with its blue mot triangles and the offer to fix cars, motor cycles, three wheelers. shabby wooden doors face the pavement, or can be accessed up backstairs along balcony walkways. a tabby cat looks down from a concrete ledge. children kick about in a high-fenced football corral. a mural commemorates billy cox, 1991-2007. someone's rice takeaway fills a puddle. the residents association winter party is pencilled in for mid-december.

a few runs of flats are boarded up, their windows firmly pinned shut. squibb group limited started demolition last month within a zig-zagged sliver alongside the railway. the site's being developed by tfl as part of their new role as the mayor's housing provider, and will shoehorn 55 all-affordable flats into this awkward space. if i say bricky and balconied, you already know exactly what they'll look like. the remainder of the fenwick estate is on lambeth council's regeneration list, hopelessly delayed, but already pumping out newsletter after newsletter to keep existing residents informed. everyone'll be sequentially decanted, rather than kicked out in favour of rich incomers, but not for a while yet. don't expect open staircases in the replacement.

four miles south: saxby road estate, sw2
(close to brixton prison)


where precisely a geographical marker lands is a bit of a lottery. a slight nudge to either side and we'd have landed amid victorian terraces, not always immaculately maintained... a little further and we might have hit a dense lcc estate or even prison cells. instead welcome to the saxby lane estate, an enclave of postwar council housing a couple of streets from the south circular. a sign showing the staggered layout of these 70 homes has been planted into a low-walled lawn at one end, along with a few emerging daffodils. lambeth's architects weren't over-keen to give most residents front gardens, so have provided communal shrubberies, raised beds and lawns instead. one such raised bed is empty other than a mattress, a broken table and chairs, plus a fridge-freezer. rose bushes have been ferociously pruned. dogs are forbidden from squatting. balls must not be kicked. 

i take a seat on the central bench, with its plaque in memory of alim uddin, son and brother. noticing that he died aged only 17 i do a quick google search and discover that he was stabbed quarter of a mile away after an argument over a failed bike purchase. around the foot of the bench are numerous fag ends, scatterings of freshly-mown grass, a bottle top and a single bacon-flavour corn-based snack i still think of as a frazzle. the phone box still works, unexpectedly, although these days functions mostly an advert for rennie. a pasted-up sheet of paper announces that mehret is offering holistic pain-free pilates taster sessions 25 times a week in january, which suggests she's rather short of custom. i count 22 satellite dishes on the surrounding flats and houses, plus one england flag. saxby's tenants could be holed up somewhere far worse.

five miles south: streatham high road, sw16
(at the end of leigham avenue)


streatham's high street lays claim to being the longest in europe (which means we'll still be on it at six miles south). on this occasion we're at the top end, nearer streatham hill, slap bang in the immediate vicinity of nando's. diners at windowside tables can be clearly seen tucking into peri-peri, forking salad into their mouths or fiddling with their phones while they wait for chicken to arrive. across the street is tariq halal meats, its windows larger, its counter display brighter, its website more prominent and its meat offering more varied... mutton, lamb, goat, quails. for coffee and e-cigarettes, try caffe vape. for disco equipment, obviously fizz dj. on a saturday afternoon businesses are ticking over nicely.

what's unusual is that the shopping parades meeting here both sit beneath enormous mansion blocks. leigham hall forms one end of streatham court, designed in classic late-30s style by reginald toms, hence the lovely coppery-green tiles arrayed along porches and roofs. across the street is the high, built one year later with similarly art-deco-ish entrance doors tucked inbetween the shops at ground level. look up, however, and the windows of the high are original and miserably peeling, whereas leigham hall's have been renewed and look like they might keep the heat in a bit better. i'm not sure if either still boasts a billiards room or uniformed porters, and rents must now be well above the original £80 per annum, but how great to live at the heart of things in a building of character.

six miles south: streatham common
(southwest corner)


six miles south serendipitously lands in the bottom left-hand corner of streatham common, alongside the high road, just opposite sainsbury's. lush slopes, intermittently fenced off with orange netting, spread uphill towards the tearoom and the distant rookery. down here there's simply an avenue of horse chestnuts, in full blossom, and a plane tree which may or may not be dead. criss-crossing paths lead off across the common, carefully following desire lines so nobody feels the need to divert onto the grass. shoppers trudge by, variously laden, followed by a glum youth in a nasa hoodie smoking a rollup. a gardener from lambeth landscapes edges his white van down the footpath taking care not to run anybody over. 

at the bus stop a posse of homebound schoolkids in maroon blazers hurl swear words, and in one case a heavy log, at one another. a procession of hearses crawls by, kicking off with grandad, then a floral tribute in the shape of a football, then various members of his family. the friends of streatham common invite you to a bat walk on friday, a bird box survey on saturday and a kite day on sunday. silvana ices have parked up opposite the entrance to the playground hoping that someone will take their advice and 'try a twin cone today'. the clock on the tower of immanuel and st andrew's church is 70 minutes slow. dad kicks a football through the dandelions, and small son passes it back. 'celebrate streatham', says the banner hung from the streetlamp, and here you would.

seven miles south: northborough road, sw16
(norbury/pollards hill)


northborough road breaks off from the main road by norbury's wetherspoons and dives deep into edwardian suburbia. the estate agent on the corner appears to have the monopoly on house sales and flat rentals further up. initially they're quite terracy, with front gardens barely large enough to hold croydon's full complement of three bins. then a few gabled properties intrude, then it gets quite mixed, but always stitched together with no direct rear access. the house numbers are my favourite feature, each embedded in the wall as separate digits on glazed tiles, one brick's length from the edge of the porch. the precise location we're looking for is in the high hundreds, by the stinkpipe, right on the brow of the hill.

the view to the west is remarkably lowrise, with merton civic centre the sole tower along a woody skyline. lined up to the east are the crystal palace tv mast, a church spire and the former windsor house office block. a learner from the polka driving school ascends the road with caution, slowing for each hump, trailing a procession of vehicles behind her. the council streetsweeper smiles by, earbuds drooping, although he has yet to reach the fox-ripped bag spilling  takeaway trays across the pavement. a family emerges from behind a high hedge in their eid finest before piling into an estate and driving off to celebrate. two recycling sacks have been left on a damp pillow at the end of norton gardens. a blackbird sings.

eight miles south: mitcham road cemetery, cr0
(previously croydon cemetery)


i wondered how long it'd take this feature to hit a cemetery, and here we are, if not quite dead centre. croydon cemetery opened in 1897 as overspill for queen's road cemetery, the other side of thornton heath. it's big and it's irregular, having been extended once in 1935 towards mitcham common and again in 1937 towards mitcham road. 8 miles south is to be found within the northwestern strip, specifically in section u, just over the wall from archbishop lanfranc academy. look for the jamaican flag, then nudge back a bit towards the central lime avenue. other parts of the cemetery had mourners, shortcutting pedestrians, even learner drivers enjoying off-road practice, but nobody interrupted me here.

the graves hereabouts are a particularly motley assortment, mostly from 1935 but with infill from dates clustered around 1960 and 2014. older headstones commemorate alfreds, louisas and mildreds, the most recent luigis, franciscos and murildas. most graves are low-edged and weed-topped, a few sparkle with plastic blooms and it seems only jane merits real gladioli. a deflated balloon hangs from margaret's temporary marker. a tennis ball and an empty can of scrumpy jack rest in the trimmed grass. most of the interred had a good innings, notably major dorothy bristow who hit 93, but skye barely reached 15 and our baby eileen patricia just 2½. undoubtedly the saddest tale is that of cicely boswell who lost her husband in an accident in may 1939, then her 18 year-old son in an accidental drowning on easter day 1949, while she herself lived on until 1998. here they all lie, the remembered and the forgotten.

nine miles south: beddington industrial area, cr0
(junction of marlowe way and beddington farm road)


this isn't pleasant. we're on the site of beddington sewage works, since relocated to the other side of beddington lane to leave space for a huge wodge of industrial estate. the closest landmark is croydon's ikea, but that and the remainder of the valley park retail and leisure complex is deliberately segregated from the beddington industrial area resource management hub, which is very much sutton's grubbiest quarter. i trekked in dodging trucks and vans, and a one-off pony and trap, heading for the line of pylons crossing marlowe way. at the end of the road is the backside of a very big asda, and across the road a major distribution centre for another supermarket, namely sainsbury's. most of it is lorry park, and several of the dozen bays have eddie stobart containers poking out.

the nine mile point is occupied by the beddington conference centre, reputedly "the ideal place for organising business meetings, conferences or a complete solution for events and receptions ideal for corporate clients". i hope the interior's something special because from the outside my first thought was provincial motel. a rim of barbed wire and a security guard with a barrier combine to ensure nobody gets to wander in off-spec. also within this perimeter is the hq of fruitful office, a company who deliver baskets of fruit to offices because that's a thing now. their chief selling point is that they split the bunches of bananas and grapes in advance to stop employees taking too many, but they must be doing well because i counted 20 delivery vans outside. if your company needs a regular wellbeing perk, never ever tell your staff that their plums arrive via a former sewage works.

ten miles south: the chase, south beddington sm6
(backing onto godalming avenue)


finally here's another residential one. we're in beddington, between wallington in sutton and waddon in croydon, and administratively in the former. a hundred years ago these were open fields outside the hamlet of bandon hill, facing an aerodrome that would shortly become london's first airport. the march of suburbia then claimed the available space between main road and railway, forming the high view estate, hence i find myself amid very thirties houses along very thirties avenues built with the lower middle class very much in mind. the chase is the spine road, and runty central avenue would have provided the retail focus but has now been reduced to three shops. one's a convenience store that still does newspaper delivery, one's the hq for a slotcutting company and the third belongs to the 'sausage master'. drop in and daniel parker will sell you pork, stilton & cranberry, black porkies or a full-on venison, because that's what fourth generation butchers now do.

the local housing stock consists of what looks like several semis joined together. this makes rear access tricky, so the architects also squeezed long narrow alleyways round the back between the avenues. this is also where they stuck the garages, because motorists' needs were less important then, but driving today's vehicles in and out would be far more impractical so everyone now parks out front. down the chase each front garden is large enough to accommodate a family saloon, but on godalming avenue most bonnets poke out onto the pavement. because i visited on sunday morning cars were being washed, hoovered and generally worshipped. unmodified porches still had their original stained glass house numbers. the lower branches of one conifer were heavy with bird feeders. one pink rose looked like it'll hang on into winter. a tabby cat padded past. such is london life, ten miles from the centre.
