flip mirrors and other optical image switching systems.
this paper begins with a history of image switching system (flip mirror, etc.) development for astronomical telescopes, including the development of the versacorp versagonal as an amateur project in 1982.  it focuses on the use of flip mirrors and other image switching systems for subject acquisition and convenient switching between visual and photographic use of a telescope or other optical system.  some systems, such as the patented versacorp diaguider, combine the functions of a flip mirror and off-axis guider.  most of this document is under construction.

astro images: images are envisioned to include: comet hyakutake with 300 mm lens; comet hale-bopp with 300 mm lens; summer milky way with 16 mm fisheye lens; m42 with celestron 8" sct; deep-sky & other astro photos with questar 3.5.

part 3: techniques for wide angle eclipse photography (30k text file with ~250k of images)
part 4: fun with wide angle optics (most of this document is under construction.)

more wide angle images: images are envisioned to include: photos with axial strut all-sky reflectors (from 1987 rtmc presentation.  under construction.)
more images of wide angle instrumentation: images are envisioned to include: cassegrain omniramic (tm) reflector with axial secondary support strut; all-sky reflector with axial camera support strut (under construction.)
looking for wide angle optics and related instrumentation?  versacorp offers instruments such as patented axial strut wide angle reflectors and indexing rotary camera platforms for taking 360 degree panoramic images.

historical events:


sinking of the steamship titanic, a 1975 essay by jeffrey r. charles, 
written for an assignment in high school.  includes more recent analysis 
about the possibility of delaying the sinking by counter flooding, and 
whether the titanic really broke in two at the surface vs. locally 
imploding beneath the surface. (40k text file)

science and religion:


the falsehood of cosmic doomsday myths: fact versus fiction in the solar system. 
the purpose of this paper is to ameliorate distraction and unease many may 
have experienced due to "doomsday scenarios" that were circulated circa 2008, 
some of which involve a so-called "rogue planet".  specifically, the 
somewhat long document demonstrates that, based on the current state of the solar 
system and the laws of physics, many predicted "doomsday scenarios" 
are mere fantasy, won't happen "on cue", and in fact cannot happen, particularly in the near term time frame most proponents predict. it is different from my other papers, but necessary because it appears that more and more people are being influenced by false "doomsday scenarios", and this trend has to stop.

the paper is intended to neutralize the impact false doomsday scenarios may potentially have on people, specifically in the church, where there are at 
least two "lines of defense" (spiritual and intellectual) against such 
"false teaching".  the paper emphasizes religious arguments against many 
"popular" doomsday scenarios, but also addresses secular concerns 
about such far-fetched, false predictions.  this is because the so-called 
"science" in a vast majority of such predictions is flawed in obvious ways. 
the paper was first presented on 22 august, 2008, in downey, california.

practical astrophotography,
a book by jeffrey r. charles
(isbn 1-85233-023-6)
published by: 
springer-verlag
as part of the "practical astronomy" series.
available at popular book stores, including border books / 
amazon.com

this informative book captures the effective ways jeffrey charles learned 
astrophotography, sometimes through trial and error.  included are many tips 
about photography of planets, nebulae, eclipses, and more, plus a sample check 
list for travel and an astrophotography exposure guide. covers use of a wide 
range of telescopes and camera lenses, but focuses on what can be done with small 
aperture scopes because these are what many people have. it emphasizes film photography (written before digital astrophotography was very affordable), but many of its tips also apply to digital imaging. if you like astrophotography related articles at this web site, you'll really like this book!



eclipse chaser's guide to ...wow
by jeffrey r. charles
cd: navagable cd of eclipse chaser web site, plus 
high resolution 360 deg. vr eclipse site images.
(updated version should be available late 2018.)
video: an eclipse video is unlikely, partly because the first 4 eclipses were shot in analog sd video, and there is little 2017 footage of anything but the eclipse itself. a 2-hour digitally edited chronicle of 5 total solar eclipse expeditions had been planned. if a video is made, it may just be posted on a video site, preceded by video ad, but not banner overlays.
book: a hard copy book is unlikely, partly because printing costs are high for a book with images that could rival large hdtv and computer displays.
available now from versacorp:
