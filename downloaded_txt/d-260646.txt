shift problems

i enjoy amateur
radio because there
are so many things
to learn. amateur
radio is also a
great fraternity.
you can learn a
little bit about how
i started in this
hobby on my 

boat anchor
page.

if you have a link
you think valuable
to others, please
e-mail me. 
if you copy
something from here
(and even if you
rewrite it) please
add a reference link
here! linking
improves technical
accuracy because
articles on this
site are sometimes
corrected or
expanded. 
the most
important thing any
of us can do to make
the web an asset is
to help each other
with review to
insure technical
accuracy improves
with time! let's
work to make
internet a reliable
source of
information instead
of a collection
of 
folklore!!
