fall in love with your music all over again
get speakers you’ll listen to at any volume for hours on end.
show me everything i want wireless





speakers that tire your ears were badly designed.


if you get tired of listening to your speakers, chances are it’s because of distortion. speakers that are underpowered don’t reproduce the sound the way the artist intended. the compression bothers your ears and makes you think the music is too loud.
your life deserves a soundtrack all day long. great sounding speakers get you there.

if you’ve ever found yourself (or your spouse) turning music down because you’re ‘tired’ of listening to it too loud, you’re suffering from distortion. you might think you can’t hear the difference between good speakers and not-so-good speakers, but the truth is great audio is addictive, and you’ll listen to it for hours on end queuing up song after song.
does your portable speaker sound just a little louder and about the same quality as your cell phone? then you’re missing the experience that quality sound makes. you can hear the difference and once you’ve experienced axiom sound, you’ll crave it over and over again.
do you have trouble understanding the dialog on tv shows or in movies? that’s not your hearing going – that's bad frequency response. and there is a cure.
since 1980, we’ve been designing, engineering and manufacturing loudspeakers that help you to feel like you’re listening to a song for the first time.
