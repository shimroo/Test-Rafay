“8 of the best vineyards in the us”

— oyster magazine, august 2019



"anthony vietri is one of the more original winemakers in america. over the past decade, he has cultivated 
more than two dozen french and italian varietals and their clones in his "little vineyard".... they are unusual

wines, to say the least, benefitting from long aeration and tasting unlike anything you've ever tried...there is

no reference point for these wines - but they are remarkable, and, yes, quite delicious."
