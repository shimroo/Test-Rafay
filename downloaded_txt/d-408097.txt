reactome research spotlight



 [february 1, 2025] in the july 2024 issue of briefings in bioinformatics,  yi et al.  report on the biochemical pathway prediction (bpp) framework, a predictive analytical tool that utilizes various graph representation learning models to predict attributes and links in biochemical pathways. bpp provides two pieces of information: link prediction, which identifies potential connections between entities and reactions, and attribute prediction, which predicts missing attributes of nodes. the bpp framework was used to evaluate datasets derived from reactome pathway data (version 75 to version 85), specifically identifying a key receptor, glycosylated-ace2, instrumental in the  sars-cov-2 invasion process.

why reactome

reactome is a free, open-source, curated and peer-reviewed pathway database. our goal is to provide intuitive bioinformatics tools for the visualization, interpretation and analysis of pathway knowledge to support basic research, genome analysis, modeling, systems biology and education. 







the development of reactome is supported by grants from the us national institutes of health (u24 hg012198) and the european molecular biology laboratory.
