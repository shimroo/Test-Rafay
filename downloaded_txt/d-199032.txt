st. geeorges is amazing and beuatiful.  i will post pics.  the beds are confortable and the weather is similar to that in sc.  we have had an orientation (i’m typing this during the talk).  today we are heading to the church of the holy sepulcher which is there the people here think jesus was crucified. 

we began the day with communion.  the priests here are all tec.  not much else to say yet.  i will continue to post my diary and pictures here on this blog.  i will be posting while you are asleep so it will be waiting for you every morning.  i can recieve email so to to the holy trinity wevsite and find the link to my emaill there.  www.htchas.com.   god bless you and keep you in his loving embrace.

bishop mark lawrence's remarks to old st. andrew's parish, charleston sc





"if you were to ask me, what areas of christian theology have the diocese of south carolina and the national episcopal church been moving at odds, i would say they would be in the areas of (1) the trust and worthiness of holy scripture as the word of god containing everything necessary for our salvation, and (2) the uniqueness and universality of jesus christ as the unique god-man who is the savior of the human race, regardless of cultural background, religious affiliation, color, race, creed, or sexual orientation, who everybody has to decide whether they will follow or not. as he divided the thieves on the cross, between the one who continued to rail and condemn him, and the other thief who said, “remember me when you enter into your kingdom,” to which our lord said, “today you will be with me in paradise,” every human being gets behind one of those thieves and their eternal destiny. we all enter into paradise behind the thief who repented, or behind the thief who did not. since we all get in line behind a thief, everybody loses their bragging rights, of their moral goodness and virtue and deservedness. we are saved by grace, or we’re not saved at all. we either get bleeding mercy or justice. as for me and my house, give me bleeding mercy. but that uniqueness of jesus christ is absolutely essential."

editorial on abusing matthew 18 by d. a. carson





d. a. carson is research professor of new testament at trinity evangelical divinity school in deerfield, illinois.  [and he rocks! (tiger edit)]

several years ago i wrote a fairly restrained critique of the emerging 
church movement as it then existed, before it morphed into its present 
diverse configurations.1
 that little book earned me some of the angriest, bitterness-laced 
emails i have ever received—to say nothing, of course, of the blog 
posts. there were other responses, of course—some approving and 
grateful, some thoughtful and wanting to dialogue. but the ones that 
displayed the greatest intensity were those whose indignation was white 
hot because i had not first approached privately those whose positions i
 had criticized in the book. what a hypocrite i was—criticizing my 
brothers on ostensible biblical grounds when i myself was not following 
the bible’s mandate to observe a certain procedure nicely laid out in matt 18:15–17.

a powerful article about my friend sarah (sally) and the tragedy of suicide.






james island family faces holidays after death by suicide
jennifer berry hawes


caroline ball, the baby, loved to paint and draw and 
dance ballet. she and her sister, sarah, sang in the church choir. 
theirs was, in so many ways, an ideal childhood.






yet, today sarah ball damewood and one sister are all who
 remain with their father in a family robbed of its pieces by physical 
and mental illness. in 2009, they lost their mother to complications 
from a stroke.




in 2010, they lost the oldest of the four sisters to breast cancer. she was just 54.

and this year, they lost caroline, the youngest daughter. they lost caroline to herself, to the emptiness she had yet to fill.

a prayer for the people of newtown ct and all who mourn today.





gracious lord, 
in our darkest hours we, your 
children, either cling to you for comfort and solace or we hide our 
faces from you as we hold you responsible for the evil of this world. 
help us to remember that the tears you cried over lazarus mingle with 
our own on this day of mourning and anguish. help us to remember that 
you have received these innocents into your loving arms. pour out your 
mercy on those whose loved ones were lost and give us your grace and 
wisdom and comfort as we seek your will for our lives as living members 
of your son, our savior, jesus christ, the lover of souls and defeater 
of death. amen.

may the lord bless you and keep you.

how to receive criticism like a champ  by mark altrogge on march 14, 2012






i don’t love to be criticized or critiqued.  i must admit, i don’t love “input.”
i think this goes back to my intro to design class in college.  one 
day dr. grinchwold (named changed) walked past my desk, looked 
disdainfully at my project, a 3-dimensional paper fly (which was 
brilliant, by the way), and muttered something.  “excuse me, what did 
you say?” i asked.  to which he replied for the whole class to hear, “i 
said, ‘do you have a match?’  because you should burn that thing.”  i 
was stunned, mortified and humiliated.  i wanted to say, “if i had a 
match i’d light your pants on fire,” but i didn’t.

heath lambert:  gracious candor: a tutorial in speaking truth in love





...now of course there is ephesians 4:15 to consider and apply: speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into christ. if we are to grow up in christ in the context of our conversations, the apostle paul commands two things about our words...  here for entire post
