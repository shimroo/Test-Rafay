about us


 







hispanic
association
on corporate 
responsibility 














the hispanic association on corporate responsibility (hacr) was founded in 1986 and is the nation’s leading corporate advocacy organization, representing 14 national hispanic organizations in the united states and puerto rico. its mission is to advance the inclusion of hispanics in corporate america in the areas of employment, procurement, philanthropy, and governance through our leadership advancement programs, conferences, research initiatives, and public awareness.  















why we do it


 



by 2060, the hispanic population is projected to increase to 119 million — 28.6 percent of the nation’s population. yet, approximately 4% of corporate board positions are held by hispanics, and less than 4% serve as ceos. to aid our advocacy work, we evaluate corporations’ efforts to reconcile those numbers through the following pillars: 







employmentprovide jobs that ensure individual and familial wellbeing  







procurementoffer vendor opportunities to underrepresented suppliers 







philanthropy support long-term stability for the hispanic community through charitable work 







governance proactively seek diverse executive leadership
