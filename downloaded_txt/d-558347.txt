                                        i ordered a beautiful orchid for my wife on valentine’s day. we both agree that roses are overrated. the orchid arrived on time and was just beautiful.big points for me, thanks to ilex.

                                        i recently had the pleasure of working with carol for a special delivery, and i couldn't be more impressed with the level of service and the quality of their floral arrangements. 

the floral arrangement was stunning. the attention to detail and the freshness of the flowers were evident in every piece. 

i highly recommend ilex designs to anyone in need of a floral arrangement and exceptional service. their passion for their craft is evident in every aspect of their work, and i look forward to using them again in the future.

                                        i contacted ilex designs using the email on the website to request a floral arrangement. i described my desire to express gratitude, through the arrangement, that i otherwise couldn't convey to the recipients. i received a reply quickly and easily placed the order securely through the website. the following day the arrangement was delivered on time. the arrangement chosen was the designers choice and what arrived was beyond what i hoped for. a master class of design and variety that was simultaneously expressive of beauty and gratitude while retaining a restraint so each element could be admired individually and as part of the overall design.  immediately as one is experiencing the arrangement visually there is a moment when the nose picks up the accompanying beauty of the floral notes that completes the experience. truly brilliant design, i could not have been more satisfied. 
thank you ilex designs

andrew anderson and carol sharp



                andrew anderson
plants and flowers were a part of andrew’s early years, from gardening with his mother in their large vegetable garden to plucking and “arranging” his grandmother’s peonies from her garden.  his father is a horticulturalist and was a dairy farmer, and his uncle is a plant breeder specializing in varieties of chrysanthemums.

suffice it to say the plants and flowers have  always been a part of his life.

with a passion for design, whether fashion architecture art or interior design his inspiration is pulled from the random detail of a building or the perfectly constructed seam in a garment. floral design is where andrew ended - although found by accident it is his passion.

carol sharp
a former defense attorney in san francisco, carol switched careers when her daughters entered preschool in boston. she found that working with flowers and planting was much more satisfying than litigating. she met andrew when they were both working at a small shop on beacon hill where they decided to join forces as go out on their own. since it's inception in 2004, her primary role at ilex has been managing the finances; but she is always excited to get off the computer and join andrew at the design table. carol loves to shop for the flowers every morning and is particularly intrigued by unexpected blooms and unusual colors. her design style is fairly monochromatic, but she loves combining a variety of textures into every arrangement. in addition to keeping the business running smoothly and creating innovative floral designs, carol prides herself on helping customers write memorable enclosure cards.
