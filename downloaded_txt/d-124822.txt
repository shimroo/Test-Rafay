   i only want the peace of god .....
		 
i use the proceeds of this web site to ad more ebooks and to translate more recent books in 
dutch and place them on the site. there are many very profound books in english, that do not 
offer enough commercial possibilities for dutch publishers. the dutch-speaking region is small 
and an even smaller number of people buy these books. 
therefore i am very happy with your financial support. thank you!

i love audio talks and interviews and i want to share some of my favorite resources with you.
added octobre 2008: on michelle blood's website i found ringtones by a wonderful teacher, who really uplifts and inspires me and gives me great joy. here is a link to the website of reverend ike  with a generous free course and many wonderful audio's. in the seventies this teacher became immensely popular and thus visible. this immediately alerted ego to the effect he had on the consciousness of millions of the ego's slaves. ego wants the poor to remain in poverty and limitation. so the teachers who teach those who are already well off and didn't have much impact, are left alone, but the one unique teacher who really wants to redeem the poor, is attacked immensely. don't let any of the slander about this enlightened soul hold you back. since jesus no teacher has been attacked more viciously. however, he has lifted the consciousness of millions.  there is talk that his teaching had never advanced anyone. mark victor hansen, the co-author of "chicken soup for the soul" testifies differently. hundreds of millions of copies were sold of his books and he is one of the few current teachers who openly attributes his success to reverend ike. 
reverend ike's explanation of the bible is so lofty and so simple at the same time, anyone can understand it. he transitioned on july 28 in 2009. his body translated into a higher vibration and he ascended into light, but the work of this great metaphysical teacher for our transformation will continue to uplift, inspire and enlighten all who come in contact with it. 
 
from his website i have for you  his reaction to the accusers: "don't even see accusers. every accusation is self-accusation".

if you search youtube, you can find many videos with esther hicks who channels abraham. she gives a good and detailed explanation of the law of attraction. 

for those visitors who don't know the work of esther hicks/ abraham, 
you can listen at her website  to many talks and explanations of the law of attraction (loa). there is also a lot of video material from her workshops on youtube. 
video at youtube with luminary michael beckwith 
the pp prayer  

bridging heaven and earth show, an interview   with the remarkable rev. michael beckwith. 


god is literally birthing a new creation son throughout the earth today. not out of the old adamic nature but out of the christ nature which is gods original expression. we are literally being birthed out of the earth and into the eternal kingdoms as we speak. ... today is the day of salvation. 

i have saved the best for last, 
  gary sigler


listen to his teaching about natural man and spiritual man. 

in this short video reverend dr. harry morgan moses teaches about the cosmic sweep of love. in my own daily experience this is a blissful energy that envelops one and i call it the glow. the energy itself is very satisfying. nothing compares. 



dr. harry morgan moses is an awakened teacher of god, in the tradition of ernest holmes. spiritworks is a joyous, prosperous, creative, teaching center & spiritual community that reveals and celebrates god's nature. they say: we exist to inspire, nurture, enlighten, and empower everyone. and this the people at spiritworks really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really do!

did that sound familiar? the lovers of abraham have undoubtedly recognized an abe-ism. they teach the law of attraction, an old favorite of many of our writers here at absolute1.net. did joseph murphy, charles haanel, wallace wattles, napoleon hill and all those who told us about the loa get their inspiration from abraham? the source is one and teaches fundamentally that the basis of your life is freedom. the purpose of your life is joy. for those who don't know abraham, channeled by esther hicks, (though i can't imagine there is anyone like that left on the planet), here is a link to their website and video's on youtube. 


        

we must be asking better questions, because they are getting better all the time. for their products and newsletter visit their website. 
in the second video esther explains why appreciation is so powerful in transforming our experience, as well as how we can cultivate appreciation, how we can use it, and why an emphasis on gratitude is less effective. from their numerous video's on youtube, i chose this one, because it makes a great point: real transformation always comes with deep appreciation for everyone and everything, no matter what it looks like.

i agree with the divine science statement of being
    god is all, both invisible and visible. 
    one presence, one mind, one power is all. 
    this one that is all is perfect life, perfect love, and perfect substance. 
    man is the individualized expression of god and 
    is ever one with this perfect life, perfect love, and perfect substance. 
you can read divine science interpretations of 
christian doctrine  here.
there is no good or evil, there is only god!
