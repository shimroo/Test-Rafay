wings center is passionate about partnering with families to support the physical, social and emotional growth of children!movement is an essential part of learning and we encourage thinking with your whole body whether it’s through playing in a playground, participating in sports or creating art with an after-school group.regardless of the activity, our staff at the wings center choose to build on strengths as we help develop a child’s competence, confidence, connection and character.wings offers a variety of pathways toward development but a basic belief is that all children have the ability to be kind, competent, curious and caring. the wings center encourages a sense of community through play, through sports and through education. when children experience success they seem to grow wings and soar – we invite your children to soar with us too!
