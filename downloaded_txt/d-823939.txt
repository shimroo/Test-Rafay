our reviews




we thank antech hydraulics for providing excellent service support to our company under staffa hydraulic motor & spare parts. your timely offer, professional knowledge and good service are much appreciated. 
– hm machinery suppliers ltd



thank you for providing excellent service support. our overall confidence we have on antech for our hydraulic technical solutions, service support or for sometimes meeting unreasonable delivery schedules, no matter whether we are met with very positive results. having established a close business relationship with antech since 2009.

– topaz engineering



antech hydraulics has supported us to supply both new hpus and spare parts for our power units. our experiences with antech hydraulics have always been positive and prompt, as we would expect from a critical plant supplier. antech has recently helped us get firmly in control of our oil cleanliness and oil viscosity to extend component life considerably.

– bostik



i just wanted to take a minute to thank michelle pearson-lee for her understanding and patience on a recent order. she was very professional and easy to work with. her knowledge and compassion really showed through, and i would recommend anyone looking for help or components in the hydraulic industry not hesitate to contact michelle.
