helping to resuce and reunite pets for almost 10 years







hi folks! today is the first time in years that i've logged in to my blog
and i noticed that i had several hundred unpublished comments, most of which
are now published.  they weren't being ignored; i just needed a long and
complete break from all things katrina animal related.

as the 10th anniversary approaches, i have been writing up many of the
stories from that time; i will be contacting the people involved and asking
them to share updates and/or comments. this will include some of our fiercest enemies/detractors
(those who fought against reuniting pets with their owners and those who had to
be sued in order to return pets to their proper owners).  you know who you
are so feel free to contact me at noanimalleftbehind@gmail.com in advance, to
share any of the following:

what did you learn from the experience?
what would you do differently if you could?
have you acquired, adopted or fostered any animals since?
have you since worked or volunteered with any shelters or rescues?
feel free to share any other comments or reflections.

remember pam bondi ?





she was a county prosecutor in florida who refused to return master tank, a katrina dog, to his family.

she was the lawyer who lied, manipulated, and distorted facts even when presented with the truth/ evidence, causing tank's family an extraordinary amount of time, expense and emotional energy to get their dogs back. 

she was the self-proclaimed "dog lover" who ranted and raved that tank's family didn't take care of him.....yet, in spite of all the time she had him,  she never had him neutered. 

she returned master tank intact to his family. hmmm...did she plan to breed him or was she just "irresponsible" and a "bad dog owner?"
                              (see tank's cojones in photo below)           (photo of nila, sandy and master tank was taken the day nila and tank were reunited with their family)
she was the lawyer who knew that the law was very clear about ownership of master tank (and all other katrina dogs). she knew that he was the legal property of his louisiana family who did not abandon him.

she knew that according to the law, pets are considered property and owners of lost or stolen property have three years to reclaim their property, by legal action if necessary.

she knew or should have known the law yet distorted the facts to her own self-serving ends.

even after she returned tank, she continued to lie, claiming that she was given "visitation" rights with tank, and a year later, when she bought a st. bernard puppy from a breeder in ca, she lied again by claiming that she had stayed in touch with the family in louisiana.

as if.

she never admitted to making a mistake or apologize to the family. not even to the children.

dear ashley – owner of 13 year old cocker spaniel who posted on craigslist





please re-consider giving away your 13 year old dog because your small children "aggravate" her. you have had the dog far longer than the children, so she is obviously used to them and i’m sure has ways to avoid them. if not, can you get her a crate or something that she can crawl into to get away from them when they’re awake and bothering her? 


i wonder if it bothers you more than the dog when your kids aggravate her? no doubt she doesn’t like it, but if she could speak i bet she would say that she prefers to stay in her home of 13 years with annoying kids than be given away to a stranger at her old age.


no doubt you love your dog very much so i want you to know that giving her away at her age will be devastating for her. she will feel abandoned and probably become very depressed.


also – please think about what you’re teaching your children by doing this. wouldn’t it be better to teach them how to be gentle and loving with her instead of finding her a new home? by getting rid of her, it sends a damaging message to impressionable young that pets are disposable. 
whatever you do, please do not take her to a shelter - this is no way for her to spend the last days of her life. shelters already euthanize thousands of young, healthy dogs because there are not enough homes for them all. shelters know that 13 year old dogs do not often get adopted, or certainly not adopted quickly, and they just don't have the resources to keep her there for weeks. but mostly, sending her to a shelter would be the very worst choice you could make.

please re-consider this for both her sake and that of your children.
thank you.

p.s. i tried to post this on craigslist but they now have many new stupid rules about needing to have an account, and needing to provide a phone number before posting which i really don't feel like bothering with.
and to others reading this: please do not email ashley to harass her or make her feel worse than she probably already feels. 


very loving cocker spaniel needs loving home (bear, de)

reply to: comm-5kftc-1773865789@craigslist.org 

please help our loving dog dimsum find a loving home. she is nearly 13 and doesn't care too much for children. i hate to give her up but i have small children in my home that aggravate her. i'm trying to find someone who may be older with grown children or just a single looking for a wonderful lovable companion. dimsum gets along wonderfully with other animals. she has been around cats all her life. she is up to date on all vaccinations and has only minor ear infections every once and a while. although she is older she is still playful and able to get around on her own. please feel free to call me for any other questions you may have. please help dimsum!!!

updates on puppy mill legislation





1. colorado.  on january 21, the puppy mill bill was officially introduced into the colorado state legislature.  the bill limits the number of adult, unaltered dogs a breeder can maintain, mandates annual veterinary exams, and prohibits individuals convicted of animal cruelty of obtaining a breeder license.  2. illinois.  on january 19, announcement of a puppy mill bill, sponsored by fritchey and state sen. dan kotowski (d-mt. prospect), was introduced into the illinois state legislature. the bill, called chloe's bill, was named after a young female dog that was rescued from a filthy, unlicensed puppy mill in downstate macon county.  the legislation, if passed in its proposed form, would: 
create a dog breeder license act, which would prevent breeders from having more than 20 unaltered (not neutered or not spayed) dogs.
 prohibit people from obtaining a dog-breeding license if they have been convicted of a felony animal-cruelty crime, including dog fighting.
 require dog breeders to keep dogs in buildings without wire flooring and with sufficient heating, cooling and ventilation. 
 require pet stores and breeders to provide potential pet buyers with the dog's full medical history, information of spaying and neutering and information about any prior medical care. 
 establish penalties starting with fines and escalating to having animals seized and breeding operations shut down.
3. indiana.  the puppy mill bill amendment passed the house committee vote yesterday and will be voted on in the full house next week.  for more details on this bill:  http://www.in.gov/apps/lsa/session/billwatch/billinfo?year=2009&session=1&request=getbill&docno=1468&doctype=hb the summary of the puppy mill amendment includes: 

a.) anyone who during a 12 month period maintains at least 10 adult female dogs that have not been spayed and are over four months of age (exempts shelters, rescues and animal control organizations). 

b.) standards of care (ventilation, sanitary conditions, illumination, temperature, exercise and cage size requirements; no wire flooring).

c.) vet care - every animal must receive a physical exam from a licensed veterinarian every year and the breeder must maintain veterinary records on each animal.  surgical procedures or euthanasia of
any animal may not be performed by anyone other than a licensed veterinarian.

d.) pet store disclosure - requires any pet store to post name, city and state of each pup's breeder as well as name, city and state of any broker.  pet stores must maintain veterinary records on each animal and make them available to purchasers or prospective purchasers.

e.) lemon language - requires breeder to provide another dog or full refund if dog is found to be sick within 21 days of purchase.  or, if dog is found to have congenital problems within a year, the breeder must also reimburse the buyer for vet bills (not to exceed the purchase price of the dog). 

f.) cap language - maximum of 20 dogs that are (older than) one year and have not been altered at any address or location. 

g.) breeding limitation - dogs cannot be bred without annual certificate from vet, must be at least 18 months of age and less than eight years of age.  female dogs shall only be allowed to whelp one litter per year.

h.) animal cruelty convictions - individuals convicted of animal cruelty under indiana code may not operate a commercial breeding facility. additionally, commercial breeders may not hire staff who have been convicted of animal cruelty.

this proposed legislation would set regulations for dog and cat breeders, and authorize a state agency to inspect kennels and facilities that sell more than 25 animals a year.  the pet quality assurance enforcement fund will be funded from fees, fines, etc. and will provide the necessary means to support enforcement.  
for more details concerning this legislation, read "ok house to vote on puppy mill bill" http://newsok.com/house-to-vote-on-puppy-mill-bill/article/3344976

da stedman refuses to prosecute pa dog breeders who sent sick and injured dogs to auction in ohio.





two years after lancaster county district attorney craig stedman failed to prosecute the puppy mill operators featured on oprah, da stedman refuses to prosecute pa dog breeders who sent sick and injured dogs to auction in ohio. 

on october 7, of 2009, volunteers from main line animal rescue, along with agents from the pspca and a veterinarian, traveled to holmes county, ohio and purchased twelve dogs at the farmerstown sale barn in baltic - one of ohio's more notorious amish dog auctions. three hundred and eighty-four breeding dogs from lancaster county, pennsylvania, were sent to ohio and placed on the block. mlar and the pspca picked out twelve dogs showing clear signs of abuse, purchased them, then transported them back to the pennsylvania where they were examined, photographed, and treated by numerous veterinarians and specialists. six commercial dog breeders from lancaster county were later charged with animal cruelty. justice looked as though it would prevail until lancaster county district attorney craig stedman, in a move that stunned animal welfare organizations and dog lovers throughout the commonwealth, unexpectedly had all the charges dismissed. 
what the residents of lancaster county need to know about their district attorney's handling of the case - keeping in mind, craig stedman has failed to successfully prosecute one puppy mill operator in the two years he's been your district attorney.* 
1) lancaster county da craig stedman claimed he knew nothing of the investigation until he read about the case in the philadelphia inquirer on november 21, 2009. the truth is craig stedman was contacted by then pspca president harrise yaron six weeks earlier, days before the ohio auction, to discuss the legality of what the pspca agents planned to do. he gave mrs. yaron the "thumbs up" to move forward. he knew what the pspca was doing every step of the investigation. 
2) two days after the dogs were brought back from ohio, harrise yaron, pspca board member jodi goldberg, and pspca agents met with craig stedman and ada daniel dye to discuss the cases. stedman himself suggests the pspca file summary charges as opposed to misdemeanor charges, and says directly to harrise yaron: "go ahead, but you'll have to use your own lawyer." stedman claims he did not give permission for the pspca to prosecute the cases using their own attorney. this is perhaps the biggest lie stedman has told so far - and he has told it repeatedly, in an attempt to protect some of the worst puppy mill operators in lancaster county. 
3) attorney jeff conrad representing the breeders in the case, calls these men and women the "cream of the crop." kennel inspection (reports available online) tell a different story. several of the breeders charged in the ohio case have been warned by state inspectors for housing dogs exhibiting signs of poor health. 

• nathan myer's april 2009 inspection report notes seven female dogs displaying signs of paw or leg injuries, as well as a llasa with an eye injury and another dog who is unresponsive and lethargic. it is only after myer is ordered by the state that he provides these dogs with veterinary care. 

• john s. fisher surrendered four dogs with questionable health to the lancaster humane league in 2007. in april of last year, fisher was ordered by the state to have a boston terrier in his kennel seen by a vet.  according to the report, the dog had been involved in a fight with another dog and was limping with lacerations on her front leg.  the dog had been injured days before, but was treated only after fisher was required to do so by the state. 

• james zimmerman's july inspection mentions a black cocker spaniel appearing to have an untreated cherry eye in its left eye. oddly enough, one of the dogs purchased by the pspca at the ohio auction three months later was a black cocker spaniel with an untreated cherry eye in its left eye from zimmerman's kennels. if this is the same dog, then did state inspector travis hess fail to follow-up with zimmerman after ordering him to have the dog seen by a vet within seventy-two hours back in july? did the dog continue to suffer for another three months until finally being sent to auction in ohio? was the vet who signed off on the dog in july, the same vet who signed the dog's health certificate for the auction in ohio? 

why was da craig stedman so quick to drop the charges against breeders with well documented histories of mistreating or neglecting their dogs? if some of these people mistreated their dogs in the past, wouldn't this information strengthen the cases against several of the breeders charged?  
 4) craig stedman claims there wasn't enough evidence to support the charges, and yet in an email to pspca president harrise yaron he writes that he offered to provide pspca agents with warrants based on the evidence provided by the pspca and main line animal rescue. if the evidence was sufficient for a warrant to enter private properties and the breeders' kennels, then why wasn't it strong enough to prosecute them for animal cruelty? this hardly makes sense, mr. stedman. 
5) the pspca asked former chester county prosecutor and supreme court justice william h. lamb to prosecute the six breeders. when craig stedman found out that a former supreme court justice was prosecuting the cases, mlar believes that stedman must have realized that he would not be able to control the outcome of the cases, and that the breeders would not be protected as they were in the past. stedman sent letters to all the district magistrates informing them that he had not given the pspca permission to prosecute the cases - which was not true, of course. 
 6) da craig stedman dismissed the charges against the breeders without ever interviewing or speaking to any of our witnesses, the veterinary specialists who treated the dogs, or the mlar volunteers who purchased dogs at the auction. numerous phone calls were not returned; messages were left unanswered. one of the vets who treated the dogs and offered to testify is a leading canine dental specialist from the university of pennsylvania. dr. paul orsini described one poor dog's teeth as being broken off - multiple fractures with an infection spreading to the dog's facial bones. another dog's teeth were so rotted, they were hollow. food and water accumulating in its nasal cavity. 
 7) both da stedman and the attorney for the breeders, "jeff" conrad (who are friends and worked together when conrad worked for the same district attorney's office), claim that there was little proof linking the dogs purchased at the auction with the breeders charged in the cases. not true. each of the twelve dogs brought back from ohio had a tag around his or her neck. the number identified their lancaster county breeder in the auction catalogue. mlar and the pspca were also provided with the dogs' registration paperwork and/or interstate transport documentation identifying their respective breeders in lancaster county. 
 8) any concerns about the chain of evidence are also unfounded. because mlar used a private plane, several of the dogs arrived at the pspca in philadelphia two hours after leaving the auction in baltic, ohio. the other dogs were driven back to the pspca - their agents driving straight through the night.

clarification of mis-information about  "stolen" dogs  from tn rescue





yesterday i received an email with the words "urgent alert - johnson city, tn: stolen dog alert"  in the subject line. i usually delete these right away because they signal massive cross-posting and from my experience, often contain mis-information. 


 i read this one; the sender asked me to post this alert on my blog. i didn't post it at the time because i never post anything that's not sent to me directly by someone with first-hand information or until i can verify the facts for myself.

today i went to the website of canine hope rescue and read the following:



since the information about the stolen dogs has been so successfully reposted to distribute the information, i have chosen to try and redo that effort once more.

there are misinformed emails and posts circulating and i would like to clarify some information.

on thursday, the person who made the report of the robbery and attack was arrested for filing a false police report.  there was a robbery, however there was no attack and she did not see anyone "taking" the dogs.  the false report is not about the dogs missing, but is in relation to her report of having been confronted and attacked.  when she discovered the robbery the dogs were gone and there was no one there except her.   

in addition to the false report other charges were made against her, myself and my husband.  out of the many dogs in our care there were three that were very thin.  animal control chose to make charges due to the condition of the area at the time of the report and the three thin dogs.  this resulted in 8 counts against us.  all rescues at our facility were removed  and we fully released them to animal control knowing that they would spend less time there if we did.  we have cooperated thoroughly with animal control to assure the best for those taken.

i want to be honest with the rescue and dog loving community so that the focus of this situation can go away from the fact there was a false report about seeing someone and being attacked and back to the fact that there are 13 very sweet and trusting dogs that are out there and we do not know where.  they need to be found.

there are 10 dobermans, a female black labrador, and a min pin.  all are friendly and approachable.  all need the help of everyone to still get out the word.

we have had calls of someone seeing 2 friendly dobermans in the towne acres area of johnson city, 2 more in the highway area of johnson city to elizabethton, as well as a small black dog with another small dog being seen in johnson city.  also that they could be being held in the jonesborough, tn area.  it is important that if any dobermans, a lab or min pin or medium shepherd mix are seen that a call is made immediately to the johnson city animal shelter so they can look for them.  if you feel you can approach them, please leash them or confine them to an area until the authorities get there.

while reports of these dogs are being made in the area, they may not be the dogs that are missing. there is still the chance that they have been removed from the area.  so if you are outside of the east tn area, please keep looking for them.

we are deeply sorry that this situation has occurred.  we understand the questions, frustration and misunderstanding due to the false report, but the fact remains that the dogs are missing.

my husband and i have dedicated much of our hearts and ourselves over many years to the dog community and rescue community, we have successfully placed many wonderful dogs in very loving homes, helped secure placement of dogs on death row, connected people to one another in order to help more,  and educated the public about rescues and dogs in need.  we have referred, helped, cared for, transported, and rescued more dogs than we can count.  please judge us by the experiences of those years, our work with you in those experiences, and know that we are saddened that the report has slowed the effort that was in progress to find the dogs.  please keep looking, keep posting for their return to safety.

we appreciate your continued cooperation in the search for these dogs. 

if you see them please contact the johnson city animal shelter at 423 926 8769 immediately, give them specific information about where the dogs are or have been seen. 

if you have any information about the theft of the dogs please contact the johnson city police department at 423 434 6168 or crimestoppers at 423 434 6158.  

...i'm still not sure if the dogs were stolen or not, but the important thing is that 13 friendly, trusting dogs are missing in or around johnson city, tennessee and need to be found. therefore, please alert those within the animal rescue community of  northeastern tennessee to be on the lookout. thank you.

our ministry was founded during the adoption of our two youngest children from the country of haiti, an island located in the caribbean. it's the poorest country in the western hemisphere located just an hour plane ride from us soil.  haiti's people, especially the children, are trapped in a cycle of poverty that has plagued the country for generations.  it was during the adoption process, while traveling back & forth for a year and then living in haiti for three months that allowed us to really witness the extreme sufferings & daily plight of the children.  carrying shoe filled suitcases on trips, to provide quality footwear for these children, became a calling and that is where shoes 2 share started it's humble beginnings.  it's a powerful gift that something so simple makes a world of difference in the daily life of little ones & their families.  it is our hope and prayer to continually increase these shoe distributions, with each passing year, as the s2s family continues to grow!

the katrina pet syndrome: a few comments on the duct-taped cat





when the story of the duct-taped cat made the news, the shelter received over 100 applications to adopt her, and at least three people tried to claim ownership of her.she was adopted by a family that has asked to remain anonymous. good decision; it reinforces that they are more interested in taking care of the cat than in being heroes.i have to wonder if the 99 others who applied to adopt her realize that this shelter has hundreds of other cats and kittens all equally deserving of loving homes?  how many of these 99 people took a look at the other cats at the shelter or the cats at any of the hundreds of other shelters within a 30 mile radius?animal shelters across the country are overflowing with tens of thousands very nice cats and kittens. not to mention all the dogs. many of these animals have histories as sad as the duct-taped cat, arriving at the shelter from neglect, abuse, rescued from puppy mills, surrendered by irresponsible and clueless owners (not to imply that all or most people who have to surrender a pet are irresponsible).this is the same thing that happened following katrina...shelters all over the country took in cats and dogs from new orleans and mississippi which were supposed to be fostered while the shelter made their best efforts to locate the animals' owners who were displaced by the storm and flood.and potential adopters came out of the woodwork - most of them not already looking for a cat or dog to adopt. most seemed to believe that the katrina cats and dogs were more deserving than the cats and dogs that were already at the shelter.some shelters that took in katrina animals euthanized animals already there to make room for their new celebrities.then the predictable happened: a year or two (or less) after some of these katrina animals were adopted they began to show up back at shelters, or advertised on craigslist. the novelty wore off and the new owner got bored, or no longer wanted to put the time into taking care of it. or they realized that a katrina dog will chew up their favorite shoe just like any other dog. or a katrina cat might have some "issues." every time an abused cat or dog makes the news, the shelter receives hundreds of applications. i hope that when this happens, the shelter gives highest consideration to applicants who have already adopted from them, or those already looking for a pet to adopt.if you have the room in your home, your life and your heart for a cat or dog you will find the one for you at a local shelter. don't be impulsive. visit the shelters as many times as you need to decide. very often your new cat or dog will choose you when you allow it to happen.please don't buy from a puppy mill.

update on cat found duct-taped in philly





last week, 19-year-old james davis, of the 2100 block of 22nd street, was taken into custody after he admitted to duct-taping the cat because he was "annoyed." he said that he saw the cat in his backyard and he didn't know what came over him. officers also say davis left the duct-taped cat in his yard for several hours but because it was screaming so much, he dumped the cat across the walkway. the spca received information about davis throughout their investigation. the agency was offering a $2,000 reward for an arrest in the case. davis' yard backs up to the property on edgely street where the cat was found.the cat has been adopted; the pa-spca received over 100 applications her.

searching for  boston terrier stolen by "steelers8321@yahoo.com"





a woman in wilmington, de lost her elderly male boston terrier last month and replied to the following post: is your dog missing? i found a black/white 'boston terrier' type (wilmington/pike creek) date: 2009-08-20, 11:49pm edtreply to: comm-vxqbw-1334136984@craigslist.org  found wandering dog today (august 20) he is very sweet and loving, but i have 2 dogs in the house already and can not keep! i am looking for the owner so i can give him back asap! e-mail me at steelers8321@yahoo.com! hope to find the owner!!"steelers8321@yahoo.com" was obviously not interested in finding the owner.  the elderly boston terrier got out of the yard on august 20th.  a neighbor saw a car stop and someone pick up the dog; the person in the car took the neighbor's phone number and promised to call to see if anyone was looking for the dog but never called.that's a shock.the above post on craigslist appeared that night.the owner of the lost boston sent several emails to "steelers8321@yahoo.com" asking for more info about the dog that was "found" but this email account was canceled - deleted - closed.an email was then sent to the anonymous craigslist email which was never answered.if you know of anyone who acquired a boston terrier last month - who may or may not have two dogs (it seems that anyone who has two dogs of their own would be more understanding and empathic to someone whose dog was lost) and who may or may not live in the pike creek area, please post an anonymous tip here.  the owner of the lost boston will offer a reward for any tips leading to the recovery of her dog so if you want to claim the reward, please include contact info. with your posted comment. all blog comments are moderated so they won't be posted - just read by me only.thank you!

$1000 reward





police are attempting to find out who wrapped a cat in duct tape and abandoned it in a north philadelphia yard yesterday afternoon. the cat was completely wrapped in duct tape, except for its head. “i’ve never seen a cat totally wrapped like a mummy before,” said george bengal, director investigations for the pennsylvania society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. “whoever did this is very sick. the cat was found in the 2200 block of edgley street. the female cat, nicknamed sticky, was sedated by workers at the pspca so the tape could be cut away by scissors and is recovering. “we’re lucky that the tape was not on the cat for a long time. it came off easily,” said gail luciani, pscpa spokeswoman. the police are offering a $1000 for any tips that lead to the conviction of the animal abuser.

welcome at rainbow bridge





by alexander theodore, bouvier, fourth year resident on the morning of september 11, 2001 there was an unprecedented amount of activity at the rainbow bridge. decisions had to be made. they had to be made quickly. and, they were.an issue, not often addressed here, is the fact that many residents really have no loved one for whom to wait. think of the pups who lived and died in hideous puppy mills. no one on earth loved or protected them. what about the many who spent unhappy lives tied in backyards? and, the ones who were abused. who are they to wait for?we don't talk about that much up here. we share our loved ones as they arrive, happy to do so. but we all know there is nothing like having your very own person who thinks you are the most special pup in the heavens.last tuesday morning a request rang out for pups not waiting for specific persons to volunteer for special assignment... an eager, curious crowd surged excitedly forward, each pup wondering what the assignment would be.they were told by a solemn voice that unexpectedly, all at once, thousands of loving people had left earth long before they were ready.all the pups, as all pups do, felt the humans' pain deep in their own hearts. without hearing more, there was a clamoring among them - "may i have one to comfort?" "i'll take two, i have a big heart." "i have been saving kisses forever."one after another they came forward begging for assignment. one cozy-looking fluffy pup hesitantly asked, "are there any children coming?i would be very comforting for a child 'cause i'm soft and squishy and i always wanted to be hugged." a group of dalmatians came forward asking to meet the firefighter s and be their friends. the larger working breeds offered to greet the police officers and make them feel at home.other dogs volunteered to do what they do best, cuddle and kiss. dogs who on earth had never had a kind word or a pat on the head, stepped forward and said, "i will love any human who needs love."then all the dogs, wherever on earth they originally came from, rushed to the rainbow bridge and stood waiting, overflowing with love to share - each tail wagging an american flag.
