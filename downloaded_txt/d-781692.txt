history
the pot was an old
    steel can with a bolted lid.  the condenser
    was made of steel and aluminium piping and the oil separator was a brandy bottle with
    holes drilled in to let water in and out.
 

process
harvesting and
    collecting of the leaf material is done by hand.  each plant is individually hand
    pruned and shaped. the oil is extracted using water and steam distillation, which is
    gentler than direct steam distillation.
