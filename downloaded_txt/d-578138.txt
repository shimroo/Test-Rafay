it’s that time of the year! unfortunately, we have cases of kennel cough at the shelter. in an abundance of caution, we will not be doing meet & greets with animals until further notice. we are still opened normal business hours to the public (12:00 – 4:00 except wednesdays) for applications and business in the front office (no kennel access). we also urge you to use caution when visiting the shelters if you have animals at home. we appreciate your understanding while we make sure everyone gets healthy. – posted monday 2/17/2025
