testimonials



“from start to finish, the team’s flexibility, attention to detail, and professionalism were great. kemtile [a division of stonhard] has transformed the area around the new canning line and we are very proud of it.”
sean neary
engineering manager, thomas hardy group (u.k.)




"we've dealt with a lot of contractors over 13 years and stonhard really stands out because they are just so dedicated to professionalism and craftsmanship. they really stand out in the industry."
kelly krumenacker
executive director, bucks county children's museum




“the containment area for the batteries is large and needed a heavy and reliable solution that was abrasion and chemical resistant. stonhard not only provided the required solution, but also established credibility with its single-source warranty. we look forward to working with them again in the future.”
jim cullinane
engineering manager, envirowales ltd.




"installing a new floor in a 60-year-old factory, while maintaining production activity, has been a unique and logistically challenging project for rbsl and kemtile, [a division of stonhard]. kemtile was selected because of its proven experience in delivering market-leading flooring products. the new floor [stonclad gs] will provide a long-term, durable surface which greatly improves the environment and reduces maintenance costs. it is transforming the factory and we are delighted with the quality of the finished product."
andy lovatt
senior facilities engineer, rheinmetall bae systems land  (u.k.)




“all of the guests love the new flooring. everyone at the samaritan center said [the installation] went great and the new floor looks amazing.”
james r. miller, jr.
architect




“it was really great to work with the stonhard team. it always comes back to the quality of the people you’re working with and these guys probably cared even more about the floor than we did.”
alex griggs
chief operating officer, buffalo bayou brewing company




"our customers require floors that are durable and completely level to handle continuous traffic from industrial lift trucks and are protected from spills coming from the sulfuric acid in the batteries. with stonhard we're able to go with a single company who has a network across the country who install the floors and work logistically with bhs to ensure our customers have a flat application in a timely fashion. we align with stonhard to give us a much more robust epoxy floor that stands the test of time."
bill woods
director, sales & marketing - bhs




“this cafeteria floor is everything stonhard said it would be. great sound absorption, excellent cleanability and the color pattern is perfect for our creative student body.”
ken see
principal for cedar springs middle school




“with our history of problems with tile and grout, we decided it was time to look at other options. with foot traffic, rolling carts, and general wear and tear, we definitely experience high traffic in our kitchen. having new custom floor drains in our new, slightly textured, seamless flooring will be of great benefit to us!”
wendy habert
fiscal & compliance service manager, el paso county sheriff’s office




"aesthetically, the finished floor looks very good and the acoustic benefits area particularly noticeable in the upper concourse areas [of tyne and wear metro] where retail areas result in higher foot traffic. stonhard provided great support, from the original sales discussion to technical advice and installation."
david thompson
tolent construction




“if these were vct floors, we would have had to replace them six times by now.”
jon cole
general manager, marvin home center




“we wanted a seamless, easy-to-clean surface without grout lines, which are very difficult to keep clean in this type of setting. we had a few minor challenges with the facility that were quickly addressed by the stonhard territory manager."
steven hanson
chief investigator/forensic services program mgr, district nine medical examiner’s office




“our goal was to have a durable and attractive floors that our customers [healthcare professionals] would say ‘this is better than my operating room’... and they always do!”
vincent guarino
president, fusion solutions




“the scheduling of work was most helpful to us. stonhard worked nights and week-ends around a tight schedule.
bob yager
projects branch supervisor, veterans administration  medical  center




“while watching the crew work, the arc learned that a floor isn’t just a floor. it’s a complex work of art, at least as far as stonhard is concerned. the floor itself was high-tech and high quality.”
director
the arc of burlington county - nonprofit disability support center




“it was a pleasure working with the entire stonhard staff [on the coppin state university project]. everyone is pleased with the product.”
steve bond
project superintendent, gilbane building company




“we want floors that we will never have to replace again. the floors turned out fantastic and we have received nothing but positive comments since we installed them."
maurice bryan
president, cold spring brewing co. 




“stonhard’s products are excellent and exceed several manufacturers’ specifications. to my knowledge, stonhard is the only company that manufactures the products and have their own application crews. thus, from a guarantee standpoint, there is no passing the buck.”
dr. charles c. middleton
director of the division of lab animal resources at stony brook suny




“we looked at polished concrete, but it didn’t suit the customer [porsche cars north america], so we considered a large format tile, but there were concerns about vehicular traffic. this led us to specify a seamless product that was new to us. we worked with the vendor [liquid elements, a brand of stonhard] to deliver a sexy-looking version of asphalt.”
betsy nurse
director of interiors, hok




“the constant forklift traffic at the plant is no longer a concern because the new system has demonstrated the capability of handling the heavy loads."
paul fried
assistant plant engineer, general dynamics




“this is the first project that we’ve undertaken with the stonhard team and we were immediately impressed with their knowledge and experience, which was clear from the solution that they developed in response to our brief. add to this the product quality and reputation of stonhard systems in pharma and healthcare facilities across the globe, and it made perfect sense for our client [astrazeneca]. they did an excellent job.”
dave greaves
senior construction manager, bes ltd.




“it was a successful project and a great experience to work with stonhard. the crew did a great job; it went really well.”
eric siemonsma
project manager, jack link's




“i think the floors turned out great at rubix foods. i was very impressed with how the stonhard team expedited the install.”
freida m. speicher
senior design project manager, stellar




“the [capture liquid elements] floor turned out beautiful and exceeded all expectations. the stonhard crew was so diligent and detailed about placing the pennies. the surface is clear and still has the grip and traction that we were expecting. we appreciate all the hard work!”
brent frederick
co-owner, the jester group
