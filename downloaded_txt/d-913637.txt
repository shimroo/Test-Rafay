                        the decline of male leadership





principalities and powers
we are in a spiritual war
satan is here on earth - right now
lies and liars are ruling over us
the time has come to wake up and remember





we've slipped
for hundreds of years we knew who we were. we used to be proud and strong. we were the financiers, helpers, guardians of the world. people called on us because we could, and would, help. we stood up for the poor and downtrodden. we trusted in god. we put that on our money. we followed truth.
not today -
the smallest, weakest, poorest countries of this world thumb their noses at us, spit in our face, challenge us.  we've become the laughing stock of the world.
we've slipped from a position of power, strength, and respect to the very bottom of the pile.
what happened?
we the people ...
we have forgotten who we are.
our leaders are no longer 'of, by, and for' the people, they are 'of, by, and for' themselves.
"we the people" have given up.
it was "we the people" who designed the government that "we" wanted to rule over us.
it was "we the people" who wrote the laws, regulations, principles, rules, and policies that "we" were willing to live by.
"we the people" created this government through the constitution, bill of rights, and its amendments.

no, mr. biden, no! socialists, no! left wingers, no! fearful, unbelieving, abominable, murders, whoremongers, sorcerers, idolaters, liers, family, friends and neighbors - no! no! no! -

"we the people" is not the government, how stupid can you be.

we the people ...
"we the people" in these last days, because of our laziness and ineptitude, have encouraged governmental morons, false teachers, false prophets, deceivers, the beast from the sea, the beast from the earth and satan himself, to lead us away from truth - to cause a backsliding, a falling away - the great apostasy.
it's time ...
it's time to remember who we are. time to remember why we came to these shores in the first place. time to teach history to our children and grandchildren. time to replace fear with pride and power. time to return. time to stand and take back our land, our freedoms, our honesty, our truth and our justice.
it's time to kick satan and his followers in the teeth.
time to understand that in these last days "... we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."(ephesians 6:12)
spiritual wickedness
we look around and see war, hatred, deceit, terrorism, lying, cheating, bad laws, high taxes, idiots in power; and we do not realize that these things are not the problem, they are the symptoms of the problem.
correct the problem, the symptoms go away.
the problem is spiritual wickedness in high places - satan and his followers - rulers of darkness.
darkness is sin and lies.
correcting the problem requires a bit more than we, ourselves, are able to accomplish. for that we need to call on the other spiritual principal and power, the opposite of darkness - light.
light is righteousness and truth.
how do we call on light? prayer is the biggie. talk to god - a lot. tell him your problems. ask him for help - a lot (you don't have to be on your knees, you can do it while driving - it's 'hands free'). help yourself first, get yourself clean and straight, then your family, then your friends - community and country will automatically follow.
next, find a pastor/minister who teaches god's word (light) and is not afraid to tell you everything. obedience (light) brings peace, joy, happiness and everlasting life. disobedience (darkness) brings punishment and perdition.
"we" are currently in the disobedient/punishment place. "we need to get back to the obedient/peaceful place. "we" were there once. "we" will be again - soon - "we" will be getting our heavenly father's help
... and some of you ain't gonna like it.


a falling away (apostasy)
read/study 2 thessalonians 2:3-8.
synopsis - in the end times - that would be right now - three things will happen in a short time, in a progression that we should be looking for:

a falling away (apostasy) - which will reveal ...
the man of sin, satan, the false christ - who forces ...
the 2nd coming of the messiah - jesus, our savior

i was always taught the great apostasy which would occur just before the second coming was going to be christians purposefully turning their back on god and walking away from the church - and that is happening - now.
i looked up apostasy in websters dictionary - apostacy is the deliberate abandonment of a previous loyalty: defection.
people all over the globe are abandoning:
                
democracy for socialism
almighty god for satan
truth for lies
honesty for deceit and power
family for 'likes'
common sense for immediate gratification
creativity for parties and games
personal decision making for group think and popularity
history for irresponsibility
safety and security for drugs
love for physical pleasure
eternal life for perdition

i'm sure you can add more.
apostasy exposes the false christ, satan, the devil, that old serpent, the great red dragon (revelation 13:9). who quickly moves the first beast (with the deadly head wound) out of the way and takes over.  satan then becomes the 'king'' of the seventh empire.


narcissists
ânarcissists will never tell you the truth ... they will twist the truth, downplay their behavior, blame others and say what ever it takes to remain the victim. they are master manipulators and con-artists that don't believe you are smart enough to figure out the depth of their disloyalty. their needs will always be more important than telling you any truth that isn't in their favor..â â shannon l. alder
"narcissistic personality disorder is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others." - mayo clinic


why is satan working so hard in these last days
the answer is simple and direct - he doesn't have much time left - and he knows it.
he has changed our lives. his plan is not yet complete, there is more.
look around, satan is on the earth right now.  god gave him the power over the earth a long time ago. he is the "prince of this world", "the prince of the power of the air", "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience", "the father of lies", "prince of the devils", "the dragon", and "the serpent". he completely controls his followers. his followers control us.
he is the leader of the spiritual darkness that envelopes us today.  he pushes individuals and groups to do his bidding - to destroy life, family, history, and truth. he has to change the future, he has no choice. if he doesn't, he is doomed to disappear - forever - it's called 'perdition'.


the leader with the wounded brain
you should read revelation 13. it's about a leader of one of today's anglo-saxon celtic nations trying to rule with a wounded head.  it is an integral part the last days (that would be now, today, 2021).
this guy is put in place by satan himself (one of his last ditch efforts) it forces second coming of the messiah, the son of the only living god - which will happen very soon - the broken headed guy is probably here already, maybe even ruling somewhere, or about to be ...
since revelation is a book written with a very spiritual tone, the 'wound' to the head has to be spiritual as well, i'm guessing his head is full of lies, falsehoods, memories, maybe even weird plan or two (see 'truth vs lies' below).
at any rate, his term of office will be 42 months (3 1/2 years), during which time he manages to undo many established contracts, proposals, and agreements, to the point that about half way into his proposed tenure the false christ (anti-christ, satan, the dragon, that old serpent, the one that put this guy into power) has to step in and stop him because he's starting to ruin even satan's plans.
satan will look like what people would expect jesus to look like, maybe like that picture of jesus on your wall, that's pretty much what he's shooting for.  he wants people to believe in him (and most people will). if he can pull it off, he defeats god's plan and will live forever (but, see, god never loses).
satan, and his cohorts go so far as to create an 'image' of this wounded brain guy, something that they can control - a robot, avatar, or puppet.  they even give it the ability to speak.
satan tells his misguided, deceived citizens that they have to worship the 'image'.  anyone who does not will lose everything they have.  they will no longer be able to buy, sell, or travel.
a couple of months after taking over, the false christ pushes his luck a little too far, too fast, and goes after god's people, they just won't listen. finally, they pray and turn the problem over to god who steps in and sends the messiah to pull satan's plug, which he does completely and rather spectacularly.
it may have crossed your mind that the leader with the wounded brain could be biden. but, that can't be right, can it? 78 year old, stumbling, bumbling, mumbling, sleepy joseph robinette biden, jr. of scranton, pennsylvania? why, he's the president of the united states of america (i didn't vote for him but somebody did). he's the leader of the free world. he runs the greatest country on earth. he makes policies and introduces legislation that affect our lives and livelihood. he can bypass real lawmakers by issuing executive orders. he's the commander-in-chief of the largest most sophisticated military forces on the globe. why, at his finger tips are the buttons that can launch nuclear devastation at anyone. surely not him.
read the prophesy again - revelation 13. better yet, get a good concordance and lexicon and study it.  do not take my word for it, learn it for yourself. god promised to help you if you just try.


truth vs lies
as you study the bible you begin to realize that the major theme is god and truth, vs satan and lies.  it really is that way.  god's plan makes it so.
today there are more and more liars becoming more and more bold, lying right in our faces and expecting us to believe them. the lies are blatant, clearly false, and yet there are those who appear to be ignorant about what is happening. they are people who have ears that do not hear and/or eyes that do not see.
many of us are amazed that these folks are being so easily fooled yet there they are, right in front of us - relatives, friends, strangers, and leaders. they will point their finger at you and put you down with no feelings whatsoever. they get their lies from others. they are too lazy to do research for themselves.
how do you know that you are right and they are wrong? there must be something that defines the two quite opposite positions - and there is.  a non-political book that defines both sides.  a book that you can open and find the answers and you probably have a copy close by somewhere.
it's called the bible.  a compilation of 66 books written by 40 different authors over a period of 2500 years. and, it contains the real, true answers to all of your (and their) questions.  if you think someone is lying look it up and know for sure.  oh, wait - that would be research.

2 timothy 2:15 - "study to shew thyself approved unto god, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth"

so, out there somewhere satan, the father of lies, has assembled a group who have his lies in their foreheads and are gathering around them the weak and lazy who live the 'that's the way its always been tradition' without finding out for themselves what's right and what's wrong.
i'd make you a list of liars but i suspect that making the list for yourself would be more rewarding. besides, its so easy - you can tell when they are lying, their lips are moving.


how do you know when they are lying?
yes, their lips are moving - an old joke.  but, really, how can you tell?
#1). watch - you will know by what they do. matthew 7:15-20 - " ... ye shall know them by their fruits ... wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them". jesus said it twice, for emphasis. what they say means nothing - liars abound. what they do shows who and what they really are.  we've shot ourselves in the foot on this one - thin skin, political correctness, social stigmatism, and discrimination forces liars to say the things you want to hear and hides who they actually are. liked - what he said was "i never touched that woman" what he did was quite different.
#2). ask, seek, knock - matthew 7:7-11 - pray - ask god.  you will get the correct answer - he said "ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."i get more out of the news with the sound off.  i watch the pictures and read the crawl across the bottom.  news is opinion or lies, not fact.  guests provide opinions or lies, not facts.
#3). study the bible - on the footer below - "study to show thyself approved unto god ...". don't just read, study. make it part of your life.  talk with and tell your spouse, children. and grandchildren. let your family and friends see it working in you. you don't have to stand on a street corner preach, talk, bore, or irritate. just know that people will be watching. "what you are speaks so loud the world can't hear what you say". shut up and do.



âthere is beauty in truth, even if it's painful. those who lie, twist life so that it looks tasty to the lazy, brilliant to the ignorant, and powerful to the weak.but lies only strengthen our defects. they don't teach anything, help anything, fix anything or cure anything. nor do they develop one's character, one's mind, one's heart or one's soul.â
