coat 
has held
      marches, rallies, conferences and many campaigns 
      to oppose arms sales, to protest the glorification of warplanes at
      family 'air shows,'
to raise concerns about war toys, to expose canada pension plan 
      investments in weapons industries, to challenge canada's role in
us/nato-led wars, and to unmask the un's  'responsibility-to-protect'  doctrine. while  imperial 
      wars are cloaked as peace missions, they remain an institutionalized racket. the  confidence scams of war racketeers use 
      propaganda to entrap their marks with deceits like 'defence' & 
      'security.' such euphemistic sleights of hand hide  the real, economic reasons for war.
      


 
from armx to cansec:

over the decades, coat has exposed and opposed many 
      different arms 
      trade shows in ottawa. our first campaign against 
      armx '89, led 
      ottawa to ban all such shows from 
      city property.  by cancelling armx '91 during 
      the iraq 
      war, they avoided bad pr for arms buyers, sellers and users. 
      rebranding itself "peacekeeping '93," it was held at a province-owned 
      centre downtown (when bob rae's ndp was in power). this show was later replaced by cansec. 
      between 1997 and 2002, coat led protests at ottawa's militarised "air 
      show" and its trade show event. in 2008, coat rallied opposition to three 
      arms expos. these were cancelled, and protesters were credited (i.e., blamed). that year, coat 
      began a huge effort to stop ottawa 
      from ending its 20-year ban. to  city council's shame, arms shows were allowed 
      back on 
      ottawa property. cansec has  moved to a private venue near the airport and  

      the struggle continues!





press 
      for conversion!


(p4c!) 
magazine
began in early 1990. in its first decade, p4c! was a 
      quarterly focused on converting military industries to socially-useful, 
      eco-friendly, civilian uses. 
in the late 1990s, p4c! 
      embraced a broader view. because the virus of war 
      profiteering  has so deeply infected our body politic, the 
      idea of  conversion needs to include transforming a wide variety of 
      institutions, reallocating budgets, changing official narratives, 
      rethinking history and renewing the social-change movement. each issue of 
      p4c! explores  a different anti-war subject. many have 
      focused on dispelling  national peace myths about "canadian values." these 
      captivating myths are 
      effective in conjuring support for wars because they inspire public faith 
      in the deceit that 
      canada is a global force for peace, human rights and 
      democracy.               
      





coat
      and press for conversion!
were founded by 
richard sanders, 
      who maintains this website.


here 
        are some of his coat articles which debunk various aspects of canada's national peace mythology.

        this issue exposes the governments collaboration with and generous 
        support for pronato, east european émigré groups in canada whose ethnonationalist founders and heroes include 
        veterans of waffen ss divisions or other fascist military formations, 
        perpetrators of political- and ethnic-cleansing campaigns, 
        officials from and apologists for nazi puppet regimes, postwar cia 
        propaganda assets, proponents of cold war terrorist groups like the 
        us-armed nicaraguan contras and afghan mujahideen, and other 
      virulently 
      anticommunist "freedom fighters" and their ideologues.  

a section on canada's 
        state-funded 
        ukrainian diaspora includes articles on deputy prime minister chrystia 
        freeland's 30-year involvement in organizations that, being deeply 
        rooted in fascist movements, still glorify nazi collaborators as their 
        war heroes.

watching the watchers:
canadian war technologies in the surveillance of 
        us & cdn protests
a case study in how canada 
        learned to stop worrying and arm the world

        in this article richard 
        sanders targets cdn peace myths by looking at the reaper, 
        an eye-in-the-sky/killing machine armed with cdn government-subsidized 
        systems: wescam's missile-grade spy 
        sensors and cae's pilot & weapons crew 
        training simulators. used in may 2020 to spy on us protests, this 
        cutting-edge gear was used by the rcaf in 2010 against g8/g20 protesters 
        who were putting a public spotlight on global elites meeting in toronto 
        to further structure their control over global financial/political 
        systems. 
        in this romp through the cdn history of supporting the us imperium since 
        hiroshima and nagasaki, you'll meet a roman goddess, the brothers grimm, 
        drs. strangelove, teller and 
        oppenheimer, cdn warplanes and missiles armed with us nuclear warheads, 
        the rcaf's "demon squadron" and others. it concludes with a 
        beyond-the-grave thought experiment aimed at preventing well-meaning 
        canadians from becoming even more complicit in us war crimes.




mothers' 
        day at the war show
watch coat's 30-minute anti-war film 
        for free online!
narrated by ottawa's former mayor, marion dewar.

'air shows' 
        epitomize a cultural epidemic in which the
        world's most advanced weapons systems are glorified 
        as a major source of family fun and entertainment. 
when ottawa's highly-militarized 'air 
        show' was held on mothers' day, may 11, 1997, coat set up a display 
        inside the show to exhibit original paintings by iraqi children. this 
        film jarringly juxtaposes war planes doing air-show stunts for thrilled 
        families; pentagon footage of these same kinds of war planes that bombed 
        iraq; pilots doing runway poses for adoring fans; air-show kids 
        gleefully describing their favourite war planes;  interviews from 
        iraq with victims of the war describing the effect of aerial attacks, 
        and former us att.gen. ramsey clarke who describes the horror of 
economic sanctions. these sanctions, 
        enforced throughout the 1990s by the us, canada and others, killed 
        500,000 iraqi children under the age of five! there are statements by 
        iraqi mothers, songs by iraq kurds and the raging grannies, degrading 
        images of woman painted on us and uk warplanes that bombed iraq, and 
        footage of peace activists at work inside the show, including the 
        film-maker interviewing his own mother. (learn
