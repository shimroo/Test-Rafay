fr. frog's
home page
hic
locutus est veritatem
hi ho, and welcome to fr. frog's pad!
brought to you by all the conservative and self-reliant creatures of the
az mountain plains
all of my pages are best viewed at
800 x 600 - 256 colors or higher.


where's fr. frog?
well it seems that the humorless
people at the henson
        company took offense
        that fr. frog's formal portrait
 that used
 to be here bore a resemblance
        to their kermit the frog wearing a clerical collar.  they
        sent  me a letter
telling
 me to
        remove the picture.
         fr. frog has moved into the background so no one can
say he resembles anyone else
        until a non-offensive picture can be found. 
  however, if you are a clever person you just might be able to make him hop out
for a brief appearance
to say "hi!"

"during times of universal deceit, telling
  the truth becomes a revolutionary act." - george orwell
"the greatest danger to
american freedom is a government that ignores the constitution." -- thomas
jefferson

"information is more dangerous than
cannon to a society ruled by lies." - james m dakin
"far and away the best prize that life
has to offer is the
chance to work hard at work worth doing." -- theodore roosevelt
"i would rather be exposed to
the inconveniences attending too much
liberty than those attending too small a degree of it." -- thomas jefferson
"how strangely will the tools
of a tyrant pervert the plain
meaning of words!" -- samuel adams, to john pitts, 1776
�when one teaches, two learn.�
-- robert a. heinlein
"facts are stubborn things;
and whatever may be our wishes, our inclination, or the dictates of our
passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." -- john adams
(1770)
"it is better to be a warrior
in a garden, than a gardener in a war." -- old samurai saying

hi ho! welcome to fr. frog's
pad, and to the official jeff cooper archive, steyr scout rifle, and savage scout
rifle pages. if you're of a
conservative/traditional leaning browse around, and enjoy.  if you are of the persuasion
(some would call it a perversion) that
believes that only the government knows what is best for its citizens, and that
those who refuse to work should be able to live off of the efforts of others, these pages may have thoughts and ideas
that upset you.
fr. frog assumes that as you browse his pages that your pistol
is in reach. if not, you must have been asleep during the "wednesday
lecture" on mind set, and missed the whole point of api-250. bad! bad! bad!
you have to buy me a case of beer! (i love grolsch regular or dark, negra modelo,
or guinness. i'm also partial to good single malt irish whiskey if you've been really bad.  dark
chocolate will also be accepted as penance.) 
fr. ("father") frog? how the heck did i come by that name? well, to make a long and
boring story a short and boring story, i used to do a pretty mean imitation of
mr. kermit the frog, i like the outdoors, i get "hopping" mad at
socialists, bleeding-heart liberalism* and abject stupidity (the same
things?), i like the color green,
and i was very active in, as well as being a verger in the episcopal church for
many years, and am now a deacon in the lutheran church (ms).  i'm also a
retired hospital chaplain--hence
the affectionate "father" (fr.) title. (surprisingly, i don't like
humidity though--thus my metamorphosis into a desert frog.) i also have another
alias which you'll find if you browse around.
my wife frogette (who also goes by the nickname of sunpuddle), and i, reside in the low humidity and clean air of the beautiful state of arizona where
we are enjoying the companionship of many good friends--old and new--throughout the
state, and two furpeople, cooper and joy who we serve as administrative assistants.  
as a renaissance amphibian i have many and varied interests. scroll down the
lists below and visit some of my special areas by clicking on the underlined
links. additional links may be added as time permits.  i frequently post updates,
new information, and corrections, so check back often to see what's new, and please
>>>       
if
you find any bad links, typos, grammar glitches, or other problems please        
<<<
>>>> let me
know what page they are on, and what and where they are so i can fix them. <<<<

the contents of
this site are copyrighted.  however, if you would like to either link to a page on
my site, or use text from my site,
 i have no problem with it



if
you do the
following.

for links to pages:  please email me
    and let me know that you are doing so, and the url of your site.  i
    like to know where hits are coming from.  that's the only reason for
    asking.
for use of text and pictures:  
    please email me and let me know that you would like to do so.  i
    normally give permission as long as you don't change the content, and the following cite is prominently
    displayed on the page. " this material was originally published and
    copyrighted by john schaefer, www.frfrogspad.com,

    my works click here.  if you use them without
    permission, i won't say that anything bad will happen to you, but i would
    caution you not to go outside if there is thunder and lightning.



>> pay attention now! <<
when emailing me please ensure that your
embedded
"return address" in your e-mail program is correct. (you might want to put
your address in the body of
your message if you are not sure.)  i have had messages from people whose
imbedded email return address was invalid (hence the notice below) and they probably think i'm ignoring
them. if you don't get a reply from me within 3 - 5 business days, check to make sure that your email
program is properly identifying you. (i really
do try to answer all email.  but only if i receive it.)  
please put your
actual topic in the subject line as i filter out any mail
with a blank
subject line or "hi there," and similar headers as "spam."




if you have emailed me
        and have not received a reply within 3-5 working days,  click
        here
 to see if your name is on this list.  if it is, please 
        resend your message and ensure that your verified correct email address
        is included in the body of your message.
also please make sure
        that your in-box isn't full.  a surprising number of my replies
        bounce with "mailbox full" errors.
if it
        is not on this
        list then i probably either never
        received your email or your isp is blocking me.  because of
        all the spam problems on
         the internet some isps (like aol and hotmail) may be blocking
        my
        replies.  be sure that your mail program and your isp are set to receive messages
        from centurylink.net.



...and a request.  please

do not  add me to
your bulk email list for jokes, politics, etc.  i receive
almost 300 email messages a
day and the mail gets overwhelming sometimes, and i promise not to do that to
you.
thanks for visiting!
be of stout heart and good cheer,
fr. frog

(the cross of st. george)






the king was told that the enemy was coming
  but he had plenty of time to prepare. he denied it. much later he was told the
  enemy is closer and they still had time to arm themselves, but he said he
  didn't believe it. the enemy overran his castle and killed him. his final
  words were, "i didn't think they were serious."

  oppression come to this land, it will be
  in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy." -- james madison

disclaimer

there is absolutely nothing offensive to any normal member
of humanity who believes in freedom, self reliance, or the creator, nor to any so-called
minority group, anywhere on this web site. however, should you for some reason (maybe
you're a bleeding heart liberal* who accidentally came across this site) be offended by
the thoughts, data, and information herein contained, that's just too bad! 
grow up and
don't bother writing your congressional representatives, crying to your shrink, or writing
me hate mail.  put on your "big-girl" panties and adjust!

*  the term "liberal" is quite misused these days.
in actuality, "liberal" means standing for fewer restrictions and more individual
freedoms.  unfortunately, as used today, it stands for those 
who despise liberty and freedom.  they
are pathological control freaks that want to obliterate the mere suggestion of
any thought that would undermine their bloated and unwarranted sense of
self-worth,   who want to have the government
control all aspects of its citizen's lives and thoughts, to provide
everything for them under the
guise of "protecting" them from all harm or "hardship.  they
want to distribute  the earnings of those who work hard to to get ahead to those
who are too lazy to better themselves"--more properly called  socialism than liberalism. the "bleeding hearts" i talk about are those who
moan and groan when anyone suggests that people show some self-responsibility for their
own actions and care, or a little self-reliance, and who also seem to fear those who do try to take
control of their own lives and carry their own weight.
