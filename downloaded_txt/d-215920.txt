donor testimonials













 
“i saw how wheelchair recipients found light, freedom, and joy, to know that as human beings, they matter and are loved.”
~ kathy from california
 


 
“to the able-bodied observer, my wheelchair may represent adversity, their eyes perceiving only loss. but my wheelchair does not imprison me; it empowers me. for this reason, i choose to support free wheelchair mission and their work to give the gift of mobility to those in need. everyone deserves to enjoy such freedom.”
~ ashley from indiana

		this seventh grader was smart, well-liked, and very athletic.anh was recruited to represent her entire province in sports and was on her way to becoming a professional athlete!this all changed when she was diagnosed with bone cancer. anh endured many medical procedures as her parents struggled to make ends meet.due to finances, anh's parents were forced to sell their home. anh, unable to walk, was no longer able to attend school.but this isn't the end of her story.with the help of our distribution partner, and the generosity of supporters like you, anh received a brand-new wheelchair. it allowed her to go back to school, flourish academically, and continue towards a bright future.

		this is what mukasa told us when receiving his brand-new wheelchair. the last part brought us to tears:"i can’t work anymore. i can’t even go anywhere. i just sit from morning to night. i heard about the free wheelchairs being given on my little radio and i had to try and come here fast. "these sticks are poking holes in my hands. i have been suffering. with the wheelchair i will be able to go and buy something to eat and help myself. "i don’t know how, but god should bless you because he knew that i needed this. thank you. may god bless you! i was in bad condition, and i begged god to help me. "i was just stuck at home and now i am happy. god bless you! i have nothing to give but i pray god repays you.”we give many thanks for supporters like you, who make moments like this happen for people like mukasa.learn more about our mission at our website: www.freewheelchairmission.org
