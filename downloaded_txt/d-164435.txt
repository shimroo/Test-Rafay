welcome to the river golf club
augusta golf at its finest!





set along the banks of the savannah river, the river golf club has established itself as one of the best course designs in the southeast since it’s opening in 1998.  our augusta area golf club is a private club, conveniently located across from downtown augusta, ga in north augusta, sc.  the club has continued to enhance it’s reputation with club improvements even after being named a top five new course nationally by golf digest.
the river golf club course combines a fantastic layout with a spectacular setting to create a golfers’ paradise. designed by internationally acclaimed golf course architect jim fazio, our augusta golf club offers a unique setting which includes new mini-verde ultradwarf bermuda greens, numerous lakes, wetlands and dramatic bunkers.


designed with true golfers in mind of all levels, the river golf club offers five sets of tees, a challenging but fair layout, and all the amenities to ensure a memorable golf experience. 
we currently have a modest waitlist to obtain membership at our club. potential new members are welcome to apply!
our luxury accommodations make the river golf club a “hidden gem” as a golf travel destination and the perfect location for a corporate retreat or family stay.

*proper attire required for the golf course and the driving range (collared shirts, no denim, no cargo shorts)*the river golf club does not allow outside push carts
