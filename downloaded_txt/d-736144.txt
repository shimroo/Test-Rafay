the
        aim of this site is to provide detailed info on all aspects concerning senior citizens of
        india, so that they may lead a healthy and happy life. planning should begin early (maybe
        at 40!). old age brings some limitations, but being positive and following some simple
        guidelines can make life richer not just for seniors, but also for their  family,
        friends & society.
