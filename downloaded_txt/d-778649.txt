what our students are saying

























i'm really glad i'm here






as a student i came here by myself. flew alone from vietnam and did everything by myself and it was a huge step to just walk out of my door and go across the world alone. i was scared at first and my excitement was mixed with fear, but then everyone was so friendly and they never let me feel lonely. i am really glad i’m here. everyone helps me with everything and is very understandable and i really appreciate being here. even though i’m without my family i don’t feel lonely at any time.amy, class of 2024


























it's a nice, friendly environment

a sense of independence and humility






sba has taught and guided my son not only with rules and education, but it has also planted in him a sense of independence and humility that i believe are invaluable for life. sba has helped him the most on becoming a successful international student in an american university. the location of sba, its proximity to the nature as well as its accessibility to chicago, has helped my son develop his love for physical activities and awareness of the bigger opportunities that lie ahead of him.sam hwang, father of min hwang

the best thing that could have happened






saint bede was the best thing that could have happened for my son, dennis. i was attracted to the size, structure and discipline, and the individual attention given to each student. it is located in a very beautiful rural are surrounded by woods and fields, but not too far from big cities either. dennis spent two years living on campus in the dorm among a group of international students which helped him learn how to communicate with other people and appreciate their diversity. the faculty and administration took very good care of my son, showed patience and genuine desire to help him realize his potential.tatiana mikhailova, mother of dennis andreev
