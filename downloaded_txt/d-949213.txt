  how to make the most out of your track day

what is a track day?track days allow you to ride your motorcycle in a closed and controlled environment without worrying about cars, poor road surfaces, or speed limits - you'll be able to experience the true essence of your machine.can i use my bike?as long as your motorcycle can reach speeds of 90 mph you'll be able to use your motorcycle. make sure your bike is clean, free of leaks, in good running condition, and you'll be good to go.what gear do i need?you'll need a one-piece or two-piece suit with armored riding gear (shoulders, elbow, and knees), gauntlet gloves, motorcycle boots, and a full-face helmet.need a bike rental? we got you covered!2fast is excited to announce rental bikes are available at most of our events in 2024. the rental fleet consists of track prepped kawasaki 400 ninja’s that you can rent for one or two days allowing you to just show up and ride as fuel, tires and making sure the motorcycle is ready when you arrive is all taken care of.

  mark degross, founder
  at 2fast - your safety is our focus
like some other track day outfits, an ambulance is present at all of our events because it is required by pacific raceways, yet 2fast raises the bar on safety – taking steps that no other organization offer:on-course marshals: team 2fast has its own team of on-course marshals to help increase rider safety. this experienced group of riders spread themselves throughout the course to watch for aggressive or unsafe passes, ensure riders of a particular skill level are joined by riders of the same skill level, and are available for questions should participants need some advice. they are also our first responders to crash incidents or mechanical breakdowns, helping increase response times and operational efficiencies.

  chasing growth & community on the track

when winter rolls around, mark degross at 2fast heads south to keep working on riding, skills, and racing—because growth doesn’t take a season off! 

the photo of bike #4 is a special one for mark. he’s a few bikes back on the first corner after the start, and yes, that’s josh hayes up near the front! getting to share the track with legends like him, as well as deion campbell, bryce prince, jayson uribe, cory alexander, andrew lee, nick ciling and james rispoli, was an incredible experience.

josh may have handed mark a solid dose of humility, finishing 4th in this race to mark’s 7th, but the chance to learn, laugh, and trade some good-natured banter with him and the bpr team was unforgettable.

the off-season is the perfect time to stay sharp, get coaching, and soak up every opportunity to grow on and off the track.

how are you pushing your limits this winter? let’s hear it!





    

  off-season progress & passion
how are you sharpening your riding skills this off-season?
 @taralynn.fournier flew out to chuckwalla valley raceway for some track time and coaching to kickstart her next chapter in the best way possible. after a challenging year, she needed track therapy, and wow, did she make it count!

wednesday: on her own, she pushed hard and smashed her pb.
thursday: on her birthday, she leveled up her game with mark degross at 2fast for some coaching—focusing on nailing reference points and embracing the art of slowing down to speed up in the corners.

tara-lynn’s passion and determination are the perfect reminders that even in the off-season, every ride can be a step toward improvement.

  that is a wrap on our 2 day ken hill masterclass event. students spent another day alternating between classroom sessions and time on track to work on their fundamentals. on track sessions were structured where students would follow their instructor for a few laps then the student would lead for a few laps and then student and instructor would pull into hot pit to discuss how things went before they would go out and do it all over again. ken taught a session over data and electronics provided insight on what are the top items to look at, in what order and why they are important. we had a dry track all day today which was great. @jdbeach95 & @maldobbs126 were on track with us today and it was very exciting experience to get to see their ability to get to and from the slow point of the corner and...quickly pass you.

  it was a packed day at the ken hill masterclass at the ridge with 2fast. 

we began with a detailed track ride around where students could observe the track and receive insights into each corner. the students then alternated between classroom sessions and track time focusing on specific skill objectives and discussing them with their instructors. in the morning students and staff had the opportunity to practice their skills on a wet track, a common occurrence in the pnw, followed by a dry track in the afternoon. we concluded the day with a braking drill, where students practiced their new braking skills entering multiple turns on the track and receiving immediate feedback along with the chance to return to that same spot multiple times to apply that feedback.

we’re looking forward to day 2 which we hope will be a fully dry day.

  what a fun @2wdw superpole we had on may 6, 2024 @theridgemotorsportspark. a wet and wild one for sure, the rain stopped for a brief moment so we could hold our @cookschampagne podium celebration with hints of blue skies in the background. flying in for his first time at the ridge, as well as his first venture on rain tires, @ap3xed ty bengford pulled a cat out his hat and put the 2fast instructional r1 on the top step of the superpole podium with a solid 2:03.14 showing how good the pirelli rains are and what a quick learner he is as a rider. @maldobbs126 was hot on his tail aboard her new to her yamaha r7. literally just uncrating it a few days prior, to put her on the 2nd spot of the podium. @ctracingnw own @sagewilkinson proved his prowess in the wet with a good lap of a 2:06.7 on what he affectionately calls his “motogp” bike, the cbr1000rr-r!  also a cool factoid about this superpole, it was the first time that all three podium finishers were on street bikes; all with mirrors, headlights, tail lights, and blinkers!! talk about ripping around on “stock” street bikes…it can be done!! props to ty, mallory, & sage for showcasing their talent!  thanks to @pirellimotousa & @bridgestonemotousa for their tire contingency support, as well as @kytamericas for their continued support and having two of their sponsored riders at the top end of the podium!

  what a great season finalé we had the ridge this sun & mon!! the 2wheel dynoworks superpole sessions did not disappoint either. on sunday, galen again destroyed the field, being the only one in the 1:4x’s ripping a 1:46.38 to take home the @2wdw $100 prize award.  on monday, everyone dug a little deeper, with most superpole riders improving their times.  mr cook prevailed, setting a new personal best lap of 1:45.86, not only doing the double again, but closing the door and earning him his first superpole championship!!! 🏁🏆🏁🏆. way to go galen. trophy, superpole t-shirts, and a celebration to come later. 2fast & 2wheel dynoworks thanks all of you superpole contendenders & spectators for such a fun year putting this on, with great success!! stay tuned for 2023 superpole with podium awards, interviews and more!  congrats to galen “mr smooth” cook on his dominate performances & to @2wdw for supporting this exciting concept, providing the prize money for all the superpole winners!





    

  another very happy @kytamericas helmet customer in @michaelo.degross !  you couldn’t find a better helmet to match the scheme on his z650 any better. we especially love the carbon fiber showing through in the dark sections of the helmet!  sick, so sick!!! check out the newest models from kyt on our website, many of which we have in stock, ready to ship:

  galen cook whoops all comers and takes another double superpole victory @oregonracewaypark this last weekend!! 2wheel dynoworks @n8.phipps was quoted as saying he’s happy to give the benjamin’s to any one except (insert un-named rider) for their outstanding performance during the 2fast superpole session that @2wdw is stoked to be sponsoring and ponying up the cash prize for. track conditions were good, but a bit windy saturday when galen cracked off a 1:44.02 going ccw. then sunday he backed it up going cw with a tremendous lap of 1:43.41!! humorously, galen showed up late saturday morning and many of us there thought we might have a chance to win superpole. then the tall lanky rider emerged from his “bus”, crushing the hearts of many would be contenders!! 😂😂. so many laughs and good times during superpole. we even changed the photos up a bit so it wasn’t the same old thing!! galen now has 5 superpole wins with only 2 superpole opportunities on sep 25 & 26 at the ridge for 2fast’s season finale event. don’t miss it, or the crowning of our first superpole champion in mr cook!!






     

  galen cook does the double, taking day two’s @2wdw superpole payout with a blistering lap of 1:46.000000. interviewing the suzuki rider in the hot pits during the session, the gsxr1000 rider expressed it was the worst laptime he could get!!! further explaining he wanted to see a 1:45.anything to get into the 1:45’s. 😂😂 lol. all good fun at the 2fast superpole session as usual. another big shout out to 2wheel dynoworks for bringing cash payouts to superpole!! go visit nate & nels in kirkland to get your superpole winning tune!  galen now leads the superpole championship with three wins. adam robarts & pat farrand are tied in 2nd, with two wins each. with only 4 superpole events left, galen is sitting in a strong position to take the first ever @2wdw superpole championship, brought to you by the friendly folks at 2fast.  galen would sincerely like to dedicate this win to his good friend tom dennehy, who passed away recently attempting to save his dog in a lake. galen shared many fond memories with tom and he is proud to dedicate this win to him!





    

  stopped by @oregonracewaypark to do a track walk and seam inspection.  they’ve had a 24hr car race on the track since completing the repairs, with the fills holding up well. most importantly the track is very clean and free of the asphalt debris that was problematic at our last event.  if your on the fence about attending our event there this weekend because of the seam repairs, don’t be. we think you’ll be pleased with track conditions and thoroughly enjoy the fun adventure that is orp!





    

  galen cook takes the @2wdw parlayed superpole on day 1 of our aug 22/23 event @theridgemotorsportspark. we were unable to run the 2fast superpole round on aug 12, so 2wheel dynoworks asked us to make the next round a double payout round.  mr cook walked off with not one, but 2 crisp hundies for his rippin’ lap.  lots of talk in the paddock of people mounting new rubber for tomorrow’s superpole on the 23rd, to get closer to galen’s time.  we suggest taking their bikes to @2wdw kirkland world hq to be sure their tuning is dialed in just right!! #superpole #2fastsuperpole

  pat farrand does the orp double, winning both 2fast superpoles at our weekend event! fast pat takes home two crisp $100 bills that were discretely  expressed shipped to track by @2wdw for their sponsorship of this exciting session. farrand aboard his pirelli shod gsxr750 embarrassed all contenders saturday going ccw with a 1:46.86. then backed it up sunday in the cw direction with a 1:49.03.  great times, loads of laughs, and mr. farrand being the first to do a double at @oregonracewaypark !!





    

  a huge congratulations to chris kobernik who took yesterdays 2fast superpole with a fast lap of 2:06.5, claiming the @2wdw $100 prize award!! 2fast’s own @maldobbs126 presented the cash on behalf of her 2wheel dynoworks sponsor, as @n8.phipps was too busy tuning other potential superpole winning bikes!! the superpole session was mixed with light rain, drying wind, and then solid rain!  superpole riders were watching and guessing what setup to go out on and chris made the best choice, being the bravest of the bunch, ripping his lap on a set of pirelli slicks that @ctracingnw mounted up for him.

don’t miss the next 2fast superpole session and your chance to take the 2wheel dynoworks @2wdw cash prize award @oregonracewaypark this next weekend june 4th & 5th!
