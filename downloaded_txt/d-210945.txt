    a resource for research
  

      about us

the mcz stands with all people and organizations working to end racism and social injustice. we acknowledge the role of the museum, and especially its founder, louis agassiz, in fostering ideas of racial disparity and inequality that underlie historical attitudes towards african americans and other people of color—ideas that we soundly reject. as an institution devoted to education, research and public outreach, we are committed to developing programs that will earnestly evaluate these attitudes and promote contemporary solutions, and to offering new educational and research opportunities in the museum for people who until now may have felt unwelcome or excluded.
please visit our diversity, inclusion, and belonging page for more information.
