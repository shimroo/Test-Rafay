three areas of real estate 



realtors® do more than sell homes in suburban neighborhoods, we broker transactions for the three major types of real estate: residential, agricultural and commercial properties. 















 



residential 



homeownership is vital to promoting a strong economy and building wealth for families across america. connecting families to the home of their dreams is one of the goals of realtors® across the nation. 















 



agriculture 



the united states economy depends on a thriving agricultural system. realtors® help farmers get the land they need. 















 



commercial 



realtor® agents and brokers bring aspiring and experienced business owners to properties that will help their businesses succeed.
