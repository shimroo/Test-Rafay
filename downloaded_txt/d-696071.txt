when buying wildflowers, make sure they are propagated, not removed from the wild!
	if you have any doubt, ask!  
	some plant species have been driven to extinction in the wild due to the collection of wild plants!


welcome to 2025 â seed, hat, and gift certificate shipping is in full swing!
our plant shipping season doesnât start until april, but you can order seeds, gift certificates, and hats all year 'round! you can also reserve your plants for spring at any time, so make sure to keep an eye out 
for updates to our online catalogue! we will have some exciting new plants available this year...




 
some bumblebee species look quite distinctive, but they all seem to agree on which flowers taste the best. 
			this tricolored bumblebee (bombus ternarius) spent nearly an hour on this coastal sweet pepperbush (clethra alnifolia)!








 
beardtongues like this small's beardtongue (penstemon smallii) are also a bumblebee favorite. 
			according to the njdep fish and wildlife service, there are about 350 species of native pollinating bees found in new jersey. bumblebees are some of the most recognizable, but they're far from alone!








 
some intrepid bumblebees can still be found sneaking out for a late season snack, 
			like this golden northern bumblebee (bombus fervidus) still seeking out nectar on a late-blooming frost aster (symphyotrichum pilosum) yesterday here at toadshade.





plant shipping

toadshade is done shipping plants for the season (we start shipping plants again in april), but that doesn't mean we're closed for business! we ship seeds, hats, and gift certificates all year long (they make excellent stocking stuffers!), and we'll be updating our online catalog in january, so keep an eye out. don't forget, you can reserve plants for spring at any time!

need a toadshade hat?
we originally had only intended these hats to make us more identifiable at events, but we were asked enough times if our hats were for sale that we finally caved, 
and for the first time we're offering toadshade wildflower farm baseball caps. since we've had ours for years, you can consider these hats very thoroughly field-tested; 
working outside as we do, we are not especially kind to hats here at toadshade, but these hold up well, and don't easily fade. they make good gifts, and they keep the sun 
off your face (your dermatologist will thank you). they're soft and comfortable, a nice sage green color, and although they only come in one size, they're quite adjustable.





 
you would not believe how deer-resistant these things are.
            








 
although it can be pushy in small spaces, trumpet creeper (campsis radicans) 
			             really puts on a show when it's in bloom, and the hummingbirds love it.
            




don't see what you're looking for on our online catalogue? check back soon! we frequently make changes
over the course of the season as more species become available. and if in doubt, ask! we'd love to hear from you!

toadshade is primarily a mail order nursery, and the farm itself is not open to the public.  
we have, however, partnered with our wonderful local hardware store (frenchtown home & hardware), 
which is a âpick-upâ point for orders, allowing order pickup 7 days a week in beautiful downtown frenchtown . 
any pickup order costing more than $50 must be pre-paid, but pickup is always free! 
if you would like to pick up your order rather than having it sent by mail, please simply let us know 
(with 24 hour notice, m-f), and you will be able to pick up your order at the hardware storeâs address 
(frenchtown home & hardware, 11 kingwood ave, frenchtown, nj 08825) after receiving pickup details 
and confirmation from us by phone or email.

has your group considered a lecture, seminar, and workshop?   
randi is an accomplished lecturer and popular public speaker.  if you would like her to come share her knowledge 
with your local group, be they a garden club, a university class, master gardeners, etc. let us know.
 
check out our educational resources
listen to her discuss native plants, how she got into growing them, some of her favorite parts of being a naturalist, and ways to make an ecological difference in an 
episode of backyard ecology with host shannon trimboli

listen to her speak about native plant societies with jeff nelson from the kentucky native plant society, ellen honeycutt from the georgia native plant society and of course, host shannon trimboli in 
another episode of backyard ecology

or tune in to the native plant society of new jerseyâs new podcast, 
the wildstory: a podcast of poetry and plants (randiâs not featured in this one, but she does speak in the central blurb, discussing the native plant society of new jersey!).

randi was also interviewed for the washington post 
this year, talking about how to best help your local wildlife in your garden outside of the growing season.

and, for those of you who have always wanted to attend one of randiâs lectures but havenât been able to make it, you can now view a recorded version of her presentation 
native groundcovers: sustainable, living mulchâ on youtube, courtesy of the native plant society of new jersey.
