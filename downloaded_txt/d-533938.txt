hi and welcome to virtual online wrestling.

this is a free open-ended, browser based, wrestling game.

do you have what it takes to be the champion of vow? work your wrestler up through five leagues as you increase your experience. win matches and tournaments to gain fame and increase your paycheck. form stables with other wrestlers who share your values. vow is a place for roleplayers and non-roleplayers alike, so join today if you enjoy good, clean, wrestling action!

the rules are explained within the game so just join it and play.

the original game idea/layout comes from gilbert capulong, cerebralocelot@hotmail.com. the game is developed and implemented by plit games and all legal rights are held by plit games.
