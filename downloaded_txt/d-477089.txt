henrik ibsen, known as the father of modern drama, wrote a doll's house, 
published in 1879, based on a real-life story. ibsen's work challenged the 
socially accepted views on women in society, however, ibsen noted his intention 
was never to advocate for the rights of women. to him, it was always a question 
of human rights. as his female protagonist, nora says, "before all else, i am a 
human being".
many thanks,
renee o'connor-sura,  artistic producer

2025 salute to xena (30th anniversary convention)



	2025 salute to xena con update

 
ausxip on hiatus from 05 september 2024 to 12 october 2024
hi folks.
yes, the site has been a little quiet since the end of the ausxip charity 
auction on september 4, 2024. i have a great reason. i took a 60th birthday (yeay) 
eat pray love overseas holiday that spanned three different continents for five 
weeks! life changing event! i'm now back and regular updates will start again!
the big news from the charity auction is that we raised just over $12,000 - 
will have a definite total in the new few days.
 
the other big news...
hurricane milton!
to all the xenites in the path of milton, we are thinking of you and hoping 
you are safe! this is a monster hurricane (or as aussies call it, a cyclone).
milton may impact the ausxip server which is housed in tampa and it may go 
down but servers can be rebuilt, losing people to a raging hurricane cannot. 
please take care and know that millions are wishing for the best!
maryd
