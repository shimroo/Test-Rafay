usb audio driver usb 1.1 / 2.0 / 3.0

ploytec's    windows usb audio driver and   mac os x usb audio hal-plugin driver enable buffersizes down to 32 samples (0.73 ms) and create an ultra highspeed usb audio connection, bypassing the operating system's audio, its mixing and samplerate conversion.
this not only gives you low latencies, but better sound quality also.
using asio / hal plugin it's possible to do direct "one to one" hardware connections and even use higher bitrates, if supported by the device.




if you're a manufacturer, the driver is available for licensing. it supports almost any usb audio platform. licensing is negotiable, typically there's a setup fee and a royalty.
please   contact us regarding licensing, support and further information.device driver development 
asio is a trademark and software of steinberg media technologies gmbh.  


we offer a commercial version of the usb audio driver supporting a number of different devices available at the online shop. please download the demo.

aroma mastering plug-in


              the kitchen analogy has always been a strong motif in audio chit-chat. describing processing units, chords or production elements as âingredientsâ to âseason to tasteâ to mix the perfect dish. ..it is one of the best harmonic exciter i have found. it is one of the most respectful to the source and the cleanest i have heard in the digital domain.william robertson @ audio plugin guy
