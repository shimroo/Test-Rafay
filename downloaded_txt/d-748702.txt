2025 cubesat developers workshop















the cubesat developers workshop is an annual conference hosted by the cal poly cubesat laboratory at cal poly, san luis obispo. we  plan to hold the 2025 conference in-person at the cal poly performing arts center, as we have in years past. the conference draws more than 500 industry professionals, small satellite developers and students who will take part in three days of live presentations, q&a panels, exhibit booths, and more! this conference is particularly useful to new members of the cubesat community with invaluable opportunities to meet and talk to industry veterans. if you are interested in hearing more about this year’s conference, click the link below!
