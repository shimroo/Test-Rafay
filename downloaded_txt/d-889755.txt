most schools have a teacher that teaches the class. with av notary you get much more than that!


the instructor is a very experienced & active notary public herself.









take your notary class from an active notary public.
av notary instructor is maureen lazar. she is an active notary public & loan signing agent. she makes her income strictly by being a notary signing agent & teaching notary classes. many schools have teachers that are not active notaries or may not even be notaries at all.
