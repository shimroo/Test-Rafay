our client testimonials






we met tom joraskie the previous year regarding a home in fords that we ultimately passed on and he was the realtor for.  we liked him and i  kept his contact info for when we were lookin

amanda & michael - 40 w. hill








geri hubner was able to market my commercial property and make it sell. two previous real eastate agencies could not do that. the property was in a great location but was a changing size, she brought in the right buyer with a suitable development.

michael maglione, home seller








magdalena kuchniak did a wonderful job on the sale of our property.  she was always polite, interested in our concerns about the sale, and very knowledgeable in real estate in the area.&n

trish (patricia butkiewicz) was a pleasure to work with.  she took the time to educate me on the real estate process.  she answered any and all of my questions in a timely manner and thoroughly.  i was most impressed with her ability to determine market value of a property and aid us in negotiatins.

 "during a recent trip to italy i was in awe of the elegant, elaborate doors that break from the cookie cutter designs typically found. i thought of how the unique doors relate to my life and business. whether we are helping someone start a career, buy something, build something, we open doors for people. we open doors to positive experiences relating to one of the biggest decisions a person can make in their lives. it is very rewarding. i love what i do." . . .  broker barbara sancilardi
