notice about 2024 tax ratesthis notice concerns the 2024 property tax rates for harris county department of education. this
notice provides information about two tax rates used in adopting the current tax year's tax rate. the
no-new-revenue tax rate would impose the same amount of taxes as last year if you compare
properties taxed in both years. in most cases, the voter-approval tax rate is the highest tax rate a
taxing unit can adopt without holding an election. in each case, these rates are calculated by dividing
the total amount of taxes by the current taxable value with adjustments as required by state law. the
rates are given per $100 of property value.



this year's no-new-revenue tax rate
$0.004800/$100


this year's voter-approval tax rate
$0.005259/$100
