vollara freshair box

if you are in need of an air purifier and you don't have the big money that a full house model requires, the solution is the freshair box by vollara, formerly ecoquest international. the fresh air box is a small compact air purification system that is great for small homes, apartments, condos or even places of business up to 1,500 square feet in size.while the fresh air surround by vollara is priced at $749 and can clean the air in a home up to 3,000 sq ft, this air cleaner can take care of an area half the size and costs less than half the amount of the larger air system by vollara. the cost for the freshair box is only $349 and can be tried out through your local vollara dealer who more than likely used to be an ecoquest dealer.the technology in this smaller air purifier uses super oxide ions and what is called hydro peroxides to remove contamination in th eair in your home. the science behind this is known as activepure technology and was invented by ecoquest international since renamed vollara.the unit also has a uv light to help kill additional germs, and just like the bigger unit called the freshair surround, it also has a high intensity mode called he away mode (where you obviously have to be away from your home) that will sanitize and super clean your air leaving it fresh and clean smelling and with less germs.this mode runs for 2 hours and runs at the highest settings available in this machine. the maximum output of activated oxygen, or more commonly known as ozone, is used and the building or home where the machine is must be unoccupied. but it is worth the 2 hour wait because of what happens to the air in your home.you owe it to yourself to try out one of these air purification systems from your vollara dealer as soon as you can.

vollara

the name vollara is the new name given to the company that was once known as ecoquest international. the company formerly based in greeneville tennessee is well known for selling an advanced line of air purifiers, supplements, vitamins and other environmental technology healthy living products.the name vollara is a verb from the latin and means, "to fly". i can't say that i've ever heard  of the name before, or whether it's just a derivation from whatever latin word it comes from.the company will manufacture many different kinds of air purifiers that will clean the air in your home and office. it will also sell a line of supplements and vitamins and energy drink from muscadine grapes.this new restructuring from ecoquest international to vollara is being billed as a "ground floor opportunity" which is a bit misleading since ecoquest has been around for at least 10 years and for 10 years before that it was known as alpine industries. and all the while they basically sold the same air purifiers and some kind of supplements. while the air purifiers made by the company have evolved over the years to be more advanced, they still work the same basic way they did when bill converse invented this technology more than 20 years ago.while there's nothing new under the sun with vollara, it may be a good thing for the company to be renamed since the ecoquest bankruptcy was looming over that entity. the new things for the company are new management, new names for products, a few new supplements and a new location in dallas texas. vollara is probably working on some new products so they can have something original for the new company.stay tuned for more interesting information coming from the new vollara.
