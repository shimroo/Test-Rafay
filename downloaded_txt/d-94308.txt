                since its founding in 1920, the green section has led the usga’s efforts to improve golf course playing conditions and sustainability through research, education, course consulting, technology tools and championship agronomy. the usga’s investment in green section programs is estimated to save u.s. golf courses more than $1.9 billion each year as a result of reduced inputs and improved management practices.
