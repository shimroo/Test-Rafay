 kevin, thanks for all your help. i've finished and i love it. my neighbor and my sister think it looks better than when it was new. hubby said i saved us about $4000 if we had to replace it all (probably more since we got a deal on the furniture 1st time around).

  hello kevin, the rub-on solution for my chair and ottoman worked out very well this past weekend. i followed your instructions to the letter and both look really terrific. thanks for your help.

  kevin, we finished re-coloring our couches today, and i wanted to let you know we are thrilled. our couches look brand new â better than our expectations. for a days worth of work we saved ourselves a lot of money by not having to replace them. if you want to use us as references, feel free. thank you so much.
