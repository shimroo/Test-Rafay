 in every jar of smucker's jam, there are memories, smiles, and love








apple tree roots
back in 1897, j.m. smucker made his first batch of apple butter — from apples picked off of trees planted by johnny appleseed himself. you can now find smucker’s  fruit spreads from strawberry jam to mint jelly and we still honour the humble beginnings of our apple-tree roots.
