these 5 minutes might save you from wasting your money, time and energy for years to come.


 hi, this is indy stewart, i was completely annoyed by not being able to put on lean muscle mass and build bigger muscle after trying several different bodybuilding programs. but now after achieving success i decided to put up my recommendation on what muscle building programs work and thereby help you to avoid wasting your money or time like i did.
i burned my pocket many times trying often advertised products hypergh 14x and programs for building muscle. i learnt the hard way that advertisements are just hype, like everything else, an ambition to build muscle fast must be planned and a good foundation laid out, if success is to be guaranteed.
                      if muscle building required exercise and diet alone then you could have exercised and ate 24 hours a day. but this isn't reality. the key is proper knowledge.
the results from a recent survey by a popular fitness magazine shows that over 95% of people who begin a muscle building program quit after just a few weeks due to a lack of positive results.
                      if you really want to build muscle and gain weight fast use genf20plus, then you must make sure that you're following the right diet and workout program! below are my personnel reviews of programs and workouts that made me gain weight and help build lean muscle mass when used genf20 plus. if you want to get harder, leaner, and bigger muscles with no side-effects to worry about, then these hgh pills for sale are your best choice.

no nonsense muscle building program
 by vince delmonte
my rating: 5/5  
product review
vince delmonteâs  no nonsense muscle building  is the most credible bodybuilding program available online. vince delmonteâs muscle building workout program is what i have been using myself for past 14 months and my results are before you to judge (see image above).
this is a heavyweight program that is producing big-time results for weight trainers across the world. this mass gaining program works for males and females, beginner to advanced trainers who are looking to gain lean muscle mass fast. 
i also witnessed my friends add pounds of rock solid muscle within 3-4 months after opting for this routine. itâs an incredible feeling to get the desired results without wasting time and money on bullshit programs promising weight gain in weeks.
no nonsense program by vince delmonte accounts everything you need except genfx to know in easy to understand language. it provides step by step information on how to gain muscle fast, principles behind weight training, nutrition, supplementation, recovery, injury prevention and the least told tips on how to perform the workout routines in the most effective way.
if you're looking for a realistic approach to pack muscles as quickly and easily as you can, vince delmonteâs program is my no.1 recommendation. my own results are proof of my statement.
bottom line: with loads of practical information, email support, tools, and 2 months full money back guarantee, or to buy testrx you really can't go wrong.

the truth about building muscle no fail system
by sean nalewanyj
my rating: 4/5  
product review
currently one of the top recommended programs for building muscle on many websites the truth about building muscle by sean nalewanyj is a detailed and effective weight training program. it provides clear and accurate information on how to build muscle.
the only problem with this program is that it works for beginners (people with 1.5 to 2 year of training). more advanced body builders need to get advanced information elsewhere.
i am confident that anyone who plans his/her bodybuilding workouts or routines as per the methods described therein will see impressive results roughly up until the third year. after that you would require more advanced routines.
sean nalewanyj's muscle gain truth covers the fundamental principles you need to understand to gain weight in an uncomplicated manner. no-fail system also comes with a full money-back guarantee. you can try the program without any risk for 2 months, and get a refund if you arenât satisfied with the results.
bottom line: while this is a great package with holistic approach for anybody who wants to know how to build muscle and gain weight, it wonât work for advanced trainees.

3rd best training program
burn the fat, feed the muscle
by tom venuto
my rating: 4/5  
my product review
burn the fat, feed the muscle by tom venuto has been one of the best selling fat loss workout routine for years now. tom venuto is a well-known author and fat loss coach within the muscle building world. his program provides realistic and advanced information on how to get body fat below 10 percent.
burn the fat, feed the muscle program is the best choice for anyone who wants to lose body fat and gain lean muscle weight. this ebook product has been time tested to work decently for people who are trying to shed the extra pounds and sculpt a lean physique. although it is targeted towards people who want to lose fat and get cut, the program is effective for skinny guys who donât want to add much size to their frame.
as this bodybuilding information product is not for people who want to gain big muscles. the muscle building workouts contained there in are designed for people who are having hard time to lose fat and preserve muscle. if you are an advanced bodybuilder who is unable to shed few more percentages of body fat or a fat individual who want to look lean then you can definitely benefit from this program.
bottom-line: my personal recommendation is that itâs the best choice to learn how to lose fat and preserve muscle if you are overweight or are in cutting phase. if fat lose is your goal then go for it. and yes, this program also comes with a money back guarantee too.
for more information visit burn the fat, feed the muscle website.















here are the answers to few queries i often get by email  about building muscle and weight training routines, so please donât email me asking about the below listed information, my mail is already flooded. 
what is biggest mistake beginners bodybuilders make?

 one of the biggest mistake beginners make is to imitate the the top musclemen. think rationally on the fact that they are specialists. top musclemen have demanding weightlifting programs and supporting diet which is tailor made to suit their bodies. if you imitate them, then that's your very first step towards failure in building big muscle.








  how to gain muscle mass fast without steroids, i mean is "natural bodybuilding" really possible?
 many people ask this exact same question, and i always give them the same answer. muscular adaptation is specific to the demand placed upon the body through weight lifting routines. you do need supplements to handle this demand but not steroids.
i'm pretty sure that you will mess with your body if you decide to build bigger muscle with anabolic steroids. natural bodybuilding is the best way to gain weight. you just need to learn how to build muscle quickly.
once you get the knowledge in place then the rest is just hard work and careful planning and monitoring. the correct nutritional body building plans coupled with scientifically proven workouts will ultimately lead you to successfully add mass naturally. 
can i build muscle and lose fat at the same time?
this entirely depends on your bodyweight. if youâre overweight and never lifted a weight before then yes you can lose fat as well as build lean muscle.
when youâre something like 6% body fat and you donât have a big physique then thereâs no chance of fat loss. in other words if youâre looking to burn fat and gain muscle at the same time, you have to be rather large physically beforehand.
how long before i start to build huge muscle or see any results?
this depends. if youâre a beginner bodybuilder then you will start to gain muscle mass lifting weights inside a few weeks, if you follow the most effective warm up exercises, workouts and the correct nutrition plans that is. however, if youâre relatively experienced you will need to increase your calorie intake and the weights youâre lifting. when starting out itâs just a matter of finding out where you are in terms of building muscle. once youâve discovered what point youâre at you can then start to increase your calorie intake and the weights youâre lifting.
how much muscle mass can i gain?
the factual answer is as much muscle as you want. the realistic answer is as much as you are willing to work for. there are many factors and weight gain tips that will determine how much and how fast you gain muscle mass. some you control, some you don't. age and genetics effect things. men will grow muscle more than women. but the 2 largest variables are how committed are you to your exercise plan and your diet. you must give your bodies good powerful fuels to add mass.
lots of protein and nutritious calories, in quantities that exceed your bodies energy needs. the excess will be added mass. committed people will add more muscle mass and have success with their muscle building programs because they will train harder, and that matters. commitment and determination is the key.
how and where do i start?
beginners have completely different needs, priorities and workouts than do seasoned lifters looking to move to another level.
as a general rule of thumb you should invest in a solid weightlifting program that includes best weight lifting techniques with proper schedule of workouts. the ultimate body building program is the no nonsense muscle building program by vince delmonte. 
how to build muscle like arnold schwarzenegger?
arnold schwarzenegger won amateur and professional universe titles by the time he was 21. at that age he had 58 inch expanded chest, a 21 inch flexed upper arm, and weighed 250 lb. although he did used bodybuilding supplements to grow big fast.
arnold schwarzenegger achieved all this through hard weight training. you can replicate it provided you have the right information on how to gain weight and build muscles fast?
whats you objective here?
every body irrespective of age and gender has enough capacity to build big muscle, provided it is trained and given rest intervals at proper periods. but on the sadder note the much hyped "great body building routines and the great diets" advised almost every where are copied from 'professionals'.
it is regrettable, that a flood of misinformation and myths have swept the body building world. and all this is costing people from getting the best out of there bodies. countering this misinformation, false promises and guarantees i'm trying to give you the "must know facts and fiction" of bodybuilding industry.
through all this website you will read and get to learn the basic tips that assure muscle build up within in fastest time that is appropriate logically and in reality. all this info will help you become serious, knowledgeable and independent in your approach.
tips and information is posted regularly so check back often to be up-to-date and get best out of your body building program.
