optic nerve is a video production company founded by me, colin still, & based at my home in south london. my work is mostly concerned with poetry, the visual arts & contemporary music.
the name optic nerve, should anyone be interested, refers to a particularly resonant passage in william blake’s prophetic poem ‘milton‘.
there will eventually be a huge number of video clips, sound recordings & photographs on this site, including material which has never or rarely been seen or heard. i hope they will be of interest….
