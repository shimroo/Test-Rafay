our impact






























































what we dochildren’s alliance is washington’s statewide, nonpartisan child advocacy organization. we help people tap into their personal political power so they can advocate for change in their communities. we partner with families, lawmakers, community leaders, service providers and policy experts to develop antiracist policy solutions that improve the lives of washington kids and build a better shared future for all. 
















get involvedno single person or organization can create the change we want to see, we must work together. we believe that every one of us has the right and the responsibility to speak up for our kids and our communities. and children’s alliance can help you do that. join over 7000 advocates from across the state and receive all the information to take action on issues that matter to you. fuel our advocacy with your generosity by making a donation. visit our action center to connect with your lawmakers. or reach out to our staff to find out how you can make a difference for kids.
















undoing racismchildren’s alliance’s work is grounded in the fundamental belief that a spark of genius exists in every child. but for too many of our children, racism and poverty create barriers that prevent them from unlocking their vast potential. because racism is so deeply embedded in all aspects of our society, kids who are black, indigenous and people of color (bipoc) experience a disproportionate number of barriers to the opportunities they need to grow up healthy, safe, and economically secure.
