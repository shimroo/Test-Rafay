            with culture forward, the svane family foundation nurtures the arts — and downtown san francisco

mikkel svane, the cofounder of zendesk, and most importantly (for this story anyway), an art lover, created the svane family foundation in 2019 to support the arts in the bay area. most recently, that support is directed toward downtown san francisco, with culture forward. the program will distribute $5 million in grants on a quarterly basis starting this march through the fall of 2027, and applications for projects directed toward the downtown area open this month.
