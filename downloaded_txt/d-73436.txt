ecosun by the numbers




ecosun® has been made in the usa since 1993 – over 25 years! in that time it’s been installed on over 75,000 pools around the world, adding more than 85 gigawatts thermal (gwth) of free heat energy and helping pool owners swim longer and more comfortably.

“why did you go solar?”
we asked ecosun® owners why they made the decision to install solar instead of a fossil-fuel pool heater:

 







more swimming


 



what good is a pool, if it’s too cold to use? solar keeps your pool “swim-ready” all season long, to use when & how you want.


 








save money


 



we can’t predict the price of natural gas or propane, but we can guarantee you’ll never open a bill from the sun.

 








eco-friendly


 



fossil-fuel heaters pollute the planet, and deplete its natural resources. solar is an emission-free and renewable source of energy.

 








durability & longevity


 



gas pool heaters need to be replaced every 5 to 7 years. on a national average, a solar heater has a 15-year expected service life.
