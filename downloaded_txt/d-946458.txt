established in 1978serving up the coldest beers in town!

 

the bearded clam, established in 1978 by the strawleys, is located at 15 wicomico st. in downtown ocean city, maryland. the clam, as the customer refer to us, is a bar & liquor store. we have pool tables, video games and a dart board. the entertainment is mostly provided by the customers (ha-ha), but we also have 7 televisions and a great juke box. a feature at the clam are fresh squeezed fruit drinks and some of the coldest draft and bottle beer in town. the clam is sports-oriented and motorcycle rider friendly. our hours are 10am until 2am, seven days a week, in season. in the off season, our hours are cut back some so the help can take a breather.
