                                "the haydn" refashioned                            


composer: haydn, franz joseph arranger: molineux, allen instrumentation: solo and piano instruments: piano, trumpet genre: classical, contemporary                                                      
                                    with piano; “the haydn” refashioned for bb trumpet and piano by allen molineux is a theme and variations based on the “andante” of franz joseph haydn's trumpet concerto.  the title implies that the composer has approached the variations in a more modern (well, not up-to-date modern, just more so than late 18th century) and playful vein. it should also be noted that while each variation is based on the opening theme itself, other parts of the concerto's second movement materialize, as do brief cameo appearances of themes from the outer movements.                                    learn more

                                a suffusion of blue                            


composer: heritage, lee instrumentation: quartet instruments: alto sax, baritone sax, soprano sax, tenor sax genre: contemporary                                                      
                                    the 4 independent voices of the sax quartet weave together simple rhythmic gestures and lilting melodies in a tapestry of contrapuntal lines in this exciting work. this playful mood gives way momentarily to a more relaxed singing style, but the optimistic energy of the opening quickly resurfaces. the 4 instruments dance again in a crescendo of counterpoint, converging at the last moment in a richly harmonized, chorale-like statement of the original melody.                                    learn more

                                a thousand words                            


composer: zugger, thomas instrumentation: trio instruments: clarinet, trombone, viola genre: contemporary                                                      
                                    in 4 colorful movements: irony, blue image, serenity & rush hour. at first the instrumentation may sound implausible. however, this work is masterfully written and the instrumental combination works exquisitely.                                    learn more

                                alien loop de loops

                                    alien loop de loops for solo instrument and electronic recording by howard j. buss is a playful and capricious fantasy piece designed to appeal to a wide range of audiences. the title refers to both programmatic and technical elements in the composition. the composer envisioned a performer outside in an open area during an air show by an alien craft. during the opening section he/she is playing unaccompanied, but then is joined by the recording which contains sounds generated by traditional instruments as well as an "alien" voice, the spacecraft, and various electronic effects. technically, the title refers to how the recording was made. it consists of numerous sound loops combined to form an imaginative and picturesque sonic tapestry.  the publication includes the sheet music and a cd (attached to the inside of the back cover) that contains a performance track and the accompaniment track.                                    learn more
