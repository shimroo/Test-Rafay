if you can read me, it means that you misconfigured lychee.
please check that:
	
your
			app_url is properly set to the correct url.
			for example:
			app_url=https://lychee.example.com

if you are working behind a reverse proxy, that
			trusted_proxies is set to the forwarding ip.
			for example:
			trusted_proxies=*
			note that the wildcard value (*) is a very insecure option and not recommended.
		
if you are working behind an apache reverse proxy, that
			the forwarding headers are properly set.
			for example:
			requestheader set x-forwarded-proto https is set.
		
if the csp is blocking your assets because serving http,
			you need to force https.
			this is done by setting
			app_force_https=true
