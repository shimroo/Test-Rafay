          ‚Äúsebastian was pivotal for the growth of the cloud product as well as the core platform of graylog. coming from such a strong software development and software architecture background, he was able to quickly become productive and make a big impact. he applied his vast prior experience in the context of the new goals and transformed an early version of the cloud product into a cost-effective, modern, kubernetes-based infrastructure by working closely with cloud providers and internal stakeholders. this included both the cloud architecture as well as parts of the on-premise product.

his excellent people and communication skills, paired with deep technical knowledge are a rare combination and people across the company and departments enjoyed working with him.

i've worked with sebastian twice now and i would not hesitate to work with him a third time!‚Äù

          how many of your supposedly internal-only backends are serving critical end-user traffic? probably more than you think! most frontend services have many transitive dependencies, and understanding these dependencies becomes increasingly difficult as your system grows in scale and complexity. as a result, it becomes exceptionally tricky to ensure that internal-only backends are fully isolated from end users.

google uses a common infrastructure platform for almost all of its services, internal and external; this provides for a message-passing mechanism common to all of these services. one outcome is that systems engineers can build accurate dependency maps of services; and that we can ensure new services only depend on other services at the same level or higher in the dependency stack. 

risky dependencies ‚Äî¬†in this case, dependencies which place internal-only backends on the critical path for end users ‚Äî can be a source of major production outages, because the internal-only backends do not generally have necessary reliability or safety guarantees. for example, you might have an externally-visible service that requires high levels of availability and performance, and this system has an indirect dependency on a backend with no availability or performance slos.

at google, we found success preventing major and huge outages by clustering services into categories with distinct properties, clear perimeters, and limited blast surfaces. the properties will depend on the guarantees we want to enforce. 
in this article, we use google maps to demonstrate how risky dependencies proliferate in complex systems, and then showcase how clustering google maps services into just two categories ("internal" and "external") can prevent major and huge serving outages. we also outline how opentelemetry is used to identify violations of this clustering, which can be fixed before the violations cause a major serving outage.
this article is based on a talk at srecon emea, which you can see  here: https://lnkd.in/e54b6g6p.

          wtf google? 

aren't you "all-in" when it comes to making pwa discovery and installation easier?

90% of all apps in the app stores could have been a pwa, but it doesn't help if you make decisions like this in the chrome ui.

please turn back this idiotic decision to have "install page as app" & "install <app-name>" sit under "cast, save and share" ü§Øü§¨üò±!!!

agree?

here are the key conclusions from 12th group:

1/ developers and analysts are in trend again!

it was amazing to see all the analysts and developers in linkedinpump group getting flooded with messages from recruiters. it‚Äôs not just 1, 2, or 5 messages each ‚Äî it‚Äôs 10-20!

now i can say for sure: if you want international job offers in development and analytics, come to me!

we hacked the system!

2/ c-level can get a job only through networking.

unfortunately, no one in europe is eager to hire not local coo, ceo, cfo (and also directors). the only option is proactive networking, using connections with former colleagues, including ‚Äúrussian-speaking companies.‚Äù

we found that many c-level professionals do not have clear positioning and personal branding when entering the international market. 

so by the end of the training, all our c-level participants repackage themselves and find ‚Äútheir niche.‚Äù 

we have a lot of experience in this.


3/ you can promote your services and work in a company at the same time.

what to do if you work in a company and want to earn extra money (by selling services, consulting)? 

it‚Äôs easy - we found a way to combine both, and the system gives very fast results. if you have the desire!

4/ not only it specialists can build an international career.

here is a list of professions that have good chances for european job offers (if experience allows): project managers, product managers, all types of m&a, all types of marketing, hr (with an advantage for talent acquisition and recruiters), finance (controlling, treasury), logistics (a bit harder, but there are options).

it‚Äôs great that we built a training system where everyone achieves results!

in 9 days, we start the last linkedinpump group this year!

you won‚Äôt find a better opportunity ‚Äî in november, people are still active, so you can grab the last job openings before the new year holidays.

hurry if you want to get a job offer by spring!

          scaling culture through ùòÉùóÆùóπùòÇùó≤ùòÄ and ùóΩùóøùó∂ùóªùó∞ùó∂ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÄ with minimal friction. 

"people are not behaving as we expect"

a common observation from execs in scaling companies. 

let's stop for a moment. 

has anyone explicitly shared the current culture? 

culture, simply put, is the "way things work around here"

if culture is not explicitly defined.

people pick up on culture through observation: 

‚Üí who gets acclaim and promotions? 
‚Üí leadership values and behaviour
‚Üí who gets fired
‚Üí process

however, as companies scale, observation alone breaks down: 

‚Üí rapid influx of people from differing cultures can cause friction
‚Üí company leaders are less visible day to day 
‚Üí opaque staffing decisions
‚Üí process misunderstood

ùó£ùó≤ùóºùóΩùóπùó≤ ùó¥ùó≤ùòÅ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóøùòÇùóπùó≤ùòÄ ùòÑùóøùóºùóªùó¥

culture becomes diluted or misaligned to the original intent. 

frustration all around

ùó¶ùóº ùóµùóºùòÑ ùó±ùóº ùòÑùó≤ ùó≥ùó∂ùòÖ ùòÅùóµùó∂ùòÄ?

ùó©ùóÆùóπùòÇùó≤ùòÄ - beliefs that are deemed important 

ùó£ùóøùó∂ùóªùó∞ùó∂ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÄ - rules of thumb that guide decision making

a quick example from apple. 

value¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Üí design 
principle¬†¬†‚Üí attention to detail 

ùóóùóºùóª'ùòÅ ùó∞ùóºùóΩùòÜ

don't be tempted to directly copy from a successful company. you are not apple. 

think carefully about your own beliefs and principles as a leadership team. 

what has driven your success so far? 

ùóñùòÇùóπùòÅùòÇùóøùó≤ ùó∂ùóª ùóÆùó∞ùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª 

several years ago the company i was working for got acquired. 

new ceo comes in and makes the culture we can expect explicit. 

this is how i run the business: 

‚Ä¢ ùó©ùóÆùóπùòÇùó≤ùòÄ and why
‚Ä¢ ùó£ùóøùó∂ùóªùó∞ùó∂ùóΩùóπùó≤ùòÄ and how they have been helpful¬†¬† 

furthermore they had some additional performance principals that outlined valued behaviours. 

the result? 

ùóñùóπùóÆùóøùó∂ùòÅùòÜ 

people understood the rules. 

are your cultural ideals explicit or implicit?

          at localyze we just finished our annual performance reviews cycle. this year i got feedback not only from my manager but also anonymous 360¬∞ feedback from peers and, for the first time, feedback from my direct reports.

of course, there are always areas and ways to improve, but overall i am very satisfied with the review. nothing unexpected was brought up, and there was lots of positive feedback and a bit of actionable advice how to improve.

like many software engineers, i often experienced signs and symptoms of the impostor syndrome during my career. however, after more than 16 years in the industry, i finally feel confident about my technical skills and experience as a software engineer.

but as a manager, i still have lots of doubts. for too long, i avoided doing people management because i thought it would be too hard and demanding for me having meaningful, helpful and sometimes difficult conversation with reports on a daily basis. 

and i have high expectations of what makes a good manager. having integrity is an important aspect, i want to be recognized a transparent, trustworthy, and emphatic leader.

therefore, this short paragraph from my performance review was my highlight. it makes me very happy, and i am very proud that the people around me perceive me being empathic and see it as one of my greatest straights.¬† 

because the feedback was anonymous, i don't know who to thank. 

but: thank you very much, teammate. this paragraph means a lot to me, because it means that i am on the right track.

          give rails a chance, or if not, at least watch dhh's highly entertaining and inspiring railsworld keynote about rails 8, especially if you are in the web development business. the sentiments about simplicity and developer empowerment really resonated with me. even if you don't adopt rails, it seems important to question assumptions about what modern web development is, whether it needs to be so complicated, and what effect that has on business. i'm excited to build something again...with rails. https://lnkd.in/ggkyzjhe

          the daily retrospective
‚Äúat first we were holding retrospectives every two weeks or so. we would pick something to improve and spend the next two weeks trying to make the improvements. while this was working well, we sensed that it was too long between sessions.

sometimes when an issue comes to our attention it might be better to address it right away rather than waiting for a week or two. why wait when we can possibly make improvements in the meantime? is there any real reason to wait? 

we decided to try to meet more frequently and eventually started holding a very short retrospective at the end of each day. these short but very frequent retrospectives really turned up the good. this is like ‚Äúcontinuous delivery‚Äù but for process improvements. we deliver improvements daily and use the feedback to steer to the next step we want to take.

another practice we discovered is the ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù retrospective. whenever a team member would notice anything particularly interesting, important, insightful, or surprising, we would hold an ‚Äúinstant retrospective‚Äù. it‚Äôs turned out to be a very useful approach to reflect on something while the experience is fresh in our minds.

as a team, we like to use retrospectives to reflect, tune and adjust every chance we get. the more the better. we‚Äôll cover more about the daily and just-in-time retrospectives in the ‚Äúturn up the good‚Äù chapter.‚Äù

          from: ceo, to: cpto
subject: headcount freeze...

your mind races as you consider how you are going to hit targets.

a sense of panic sets in. 

what about my open vp engineering (vpe) vacancy?

that one can't be frozen. surely not...

you call your ceo. 

‚Üí ùóñùó£ùóßùó¢: hi charlotte,

just got your message. 

i intend to progress with the vpe hire as agreed last week. 

‚Üí ùóñùóòùó¢: 

i'm glad you called. 

i wanted to discuss that role in person.

the vpe is included in the freeze.

you have enough challenges to deal with in product. 

this was acknowledged and agreed with the board

you are not sure how much longer you can cope without a vpe

‚Üí ùóñùóòùó¢: can the engineering managers help? 

‚Üí ùóñùó£ùóßùó¢:

i don't think so. 

we did not expand this layer as our team grew. 

we should have but we didn't get budget approval.

this has left engineering managers with large remits and workloads are becoming unmanageable. 

furthermore, tech leads are now expected to line manage, many of them doing this for the first time. 

engineering managers are spending the vast majority of time supporting first time managers. 

they are operational 

i need strategic. 

hence the vpe. 

‚Üí ùóñùóòùó¢: do you have any other suggestions? 

‚Üí ùóñùó£ùóßùó¢: i'll have a think and get back to you.

          systems > smart goals - especially in software development

in april, i participated in the berlin company run for the second time. so i was interested to see how i did compared to last year.

i don't use strava or heart rate monitors much, so i didn't know what to expect. 

still, i was pretty sure i could beat last year's performance. that's because i've been doing a variety of workouts 5 times a week for the past few months.

üìå set up a good system and the score takes care of itself

the same goes for software development.

if you want to increase your test coverage, start pair or ensemble programming on tests.

if you want to get better at public speaking, find ways to practice in meetups and team all-hands.

if you want to make progress on your project, start with a workshop and have regular discussions on slack and in meetings.

smart goals makes sense when you have predictable processes. i don't find that useful in software development or in my personal life. and not motivating either.

          help me!

i have no idea how to put this, but here goes: 

this cto craft/mixer is a little bit more time-consuming than i initially expected it to be. thus, because i don‚Äôt want to just do it for the sake of doing it, and i don‚Äôt want to mess it up‚Ä¶

i need your help. we‚Äôd be working side by side in order to find a venue, decide on a date for the mixer, and select the right people for the event. you‚Äôd also, partly, be in charge of chatting with people and keeping them engaged with proceedings. some back and forth if they have questions and stuff like that ‚Äì the communication side. 

in bucharest! i would like that person to actually live in bucharest, in order for him/her to attend the event. i don‚Äôt want you to be my personal assistant. i want you to be an active, involved participant. a co-host, if you will :) 

what‚Äôs in it for you:

¬†‚áí you either like me and want to help me, out of the kindness of your heart, you good samaritan, you

‚áí the same benefits i‚Äôm happy to enjoy: chatting with interesting people from diverse cultures and fields, expanding your network and honing your administration/communication skills. i‚Äôll certainly throw in a recommendation and references if all goes according to plan. 

this is purely a voluntary position, no payment. passion and people skills are all you need. 

directly message me if you fit the description or have somebody to recommend. or just tag them below the post, in the comments. i‚Äôll owe you one. 

thank you.¬†

          ‚òï the coffee-driven code review manifesto: a sleep-deprived guide to excellence

[everyone talks about clean code, but let's be honest - most of our best reviews happen after that third espresso shot]

üåÖ 6 am: first commit

code looking pristine
tests all green
documentation spotless
reality: haven't written a single line yet

‚òÄÔ∏è 9 am: the morning stand-up revelation "wait, did i just promise to deliver this by eod?"

frantically opens ide
types while drinking coffee
spills coffee on keyboard
git commits anyway

üåÆ 12 pm: the lunchtime code review

pr comment: "interesting choice of variable names. is 'pizzatime' really the best name for a payment processing function?"¬†
me: "i was hungry when i wrote that..."

üåô 5 pm: the final push

git commit -m "fixed everything (hopefully)"¬†
git push origin please-work¬†
git prayer --recursive

üìä our revolutionary metrics:

bugs found vs coffees consumed (1:1 ratio)
time spent reviewing vs time spent making memes about code
number of "lgtm" comments that actually meant "i trust you‚Äù

üéØ pro tips for sleep-deprived reviews:

if the code works on the fifth try, it's probably production-ready
comments like "magic. don't touch." are perfectly acceptable documentation
if you can't explain your code, blame it on the keyboard

ü§î the real code review checklist:

does it work?
no one knows why it works
but it works
ship it!

          how to implement platform engineering at scale üöÄ

i contributed to a panel chat with the talented daniel bryant, franziska hinkelmann, ph.d. and smruti patel!

not forgetting our awesome host george peter hantzaras! 

thanks again to olivia christian, agnes toullec for the opportunity. ü§ó

https://lnkd.in/evbf8smt

platform engineering is often seen as ‚Äòthe answer‚Äô for orgs who want to scale their cloud presence and increase their overall efficiency. 

but actually implementing platform engineering isn‚Äôt always straightforward - especially for large orgs with legacy systems and ingrained cultures. learn how you can overcome these challenges...

          just watched this podcast episode from aakash gupta and i've had a major mind shift when christian idiodi said, "...many people know how to survive an environment...".

i've worked on and led initiatives with clear goals and timelines and but had to suffer [what i perceived] people intentionally sabotaging the work. i've experienced people who intentionally not made themselves available for meetings; given different information to different resources / caused conflict; prioritized their ego over progress and accuracy; manufactured roadblocks and wouldn't help overcome them; modified meeting notes to a point that they no longer reflect what was discussed or decisioned; became upset when milestones were achieved; refused to say "i don't know"; ignored voc feedback; micromanaged efforts (even when they didn't have the competency to be involved); etc. and, when asking "why?" to the above behaviors, they'd get upset.

despite being frustrated, my team and i still delivered the product on-time and with high quality because we were focused on the users. mind you, we had scars and questioned the longevity of our tenure in the environments. but, we got the job done. one thing that i didn't think about was "survivorship".

it all makes sense now.

          recently, my manager asked me to highlight my top three achievements at work over the past two quarters. at first, i hesitated, but then i realized i had made some significant strides. it made me think that we should reflect on our accomplishments more often to remind ourselves that our efforts are truly paying off.

so, here are my recent achievements:

1. highest-ever client satisfaction score for an external technical service - 9.3/10. this was for a code review service, which was largely successful due to significant process automation, including the use of the https://lnkd.in/dieqsk6n, and focusing more on the key pain points raised by the clients.

2. integrated a new spryker package https://lnkd.in/dpkgqw56 during a fixathon, and within just a month, it has already reached over 2,000 downloads. it is the incrementalinstaller module that executes installation scripts once per environment and stores plugin information in the database. it works similarly to a database migration system but is also suitable for data manipulation tasks.

3. completed the first code patch via spryker's contribution platform https://lnkd.in/dwuebmmw. being the first is always challenging, but i‚Äôm particularly proud of paving the way by creating guidelines for my colleagues who are interested in contributing to spryker‚Äôs product themselves.

i wonder if these can be called achievements.

in past posts, i have been less than complimentary of the dlc regulations that now make it more difficult to implement sms into an application.  i understand that all sorts of organizations use (and misuse) sms millions (billions?) of times daily.  i get that the new regulations make an attempt to reduce, as much as possible, sms spam.  all in all, it just seemed like another example of hand-cuffing the good guys while trying to put some limits on the bad actors.

my experience at the time was with #twilio... and i tried to make it very clear that my frustration wasn't necessarily with them - they were doing the best they could to handle an avalanche of organizations trying to comply with new rules that everyone was stumbling their way through.  i've been using twilio for years and can't complain at all about the platform performance for my particular small-scale needs.  it was the nearly impossible approval process that really soured me.

after nearly a year of living without application-based sms (email only), i decided to revisit.  the application was already all wired up for the feature - it was just dormant.  

this time around i was able to get up and running in 3 days...  99% of which was the dlc approval - which happened today.

kudos #twilio for suffering through the tough days and making sms once again something that can be done with very little pain.
