emergency preparednesswhen it comes to emergency water purification, potable aqua is here to help.  our water treatment tablets provide purification when you need it most.  during an emergency, don’t be caught without a source of potable water.











potable aqua, your source for potable water
the most trusted name in water purification products, potable aqua is used by various militaries and relief organizations around the world to make water bacteriolgically suitable to drink. potable aqua products provide time-tested, easy-to-use water treatment options for campers, backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts.

outdoor activities
whether camping, canoeing, hunting, or engaging in any sort of outdoor activity, it pays to be mindful of your water supply. all potable aqua water purification products are lightweight and take up very little space.
in addition to being a reliable primary method of water purification during outdoor activities, potable aqua drinking water germicidal tablets are also an excellent, inexpensive back up method to keep in your sack when using other forms of water purification. it is always wise to have a secondary option in case batteries die, a filter breaks, or your primary purification products fails for any reason. nothing can end a great trip faster than losing access to clean water.

international travel
the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reports that between 30% and 70% of international travelers suffer some form of traveler’s diarrhea (td), calling td “the most predictable travel-related illness.”
the most common causes of water-borne td are bacteria, such as e. coli, cholera and salmonella, which are reduced or eliminated by potable aqua water purification products.
be conscious of where you are. if you are traveling to a place where indoor plumbing is not widely available, or where monsoons, floods or inadequate water treatment may leave water supplies exposed to pathogens, proceed with caution.

disaster relief & emergency preparedness
as hurricanes and tsunamis tragically demonstrate, the first things to get knocked out by natural disasters are the electrical grid and the water supply.
according to the federal emergency management agency (fema) an adult needs a minimum of a half gallon of water per day just for drinking. so a family of four would require roughly two gallons per day of purified water.
when water is scarce, water purification tablets like potable aqua® are crucial for an emergency preparedness kit.

testimonials







“i love this product for backpacking! it’s so convenient & lightweight. it works great! i’ve never had any issues with it.”







“this product was great to use when i went hiking, there was no after taste when using the germicidal tablets. another great thing is the convenience, both in weight and the color coded containers. this is a great alternative for carrying around plastic water bottles or having to worry about the cleanliness of water i’m drinking.”







“i have used these on several occasions while camping in the shenandoah. i always bring them as back ups or if i can’t use my steripen. with the neutralizing tablet, you can’t taste any of the iodine. i will continue to carry this on every trip for peace of mind.”
