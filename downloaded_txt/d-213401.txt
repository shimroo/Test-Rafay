steakcamp at brave bull tonight - vancouver then and now



submitted by roland on mon, 06/23/2008 - 10:40 

check out steakcamp which is tonight at the brave bull at clark and hastings (join them if you wish), organized by raul. however good or bad the food is, i love rebecca's and others meta reflections on how we could be losing a certain vancouver "essentialness" as neighbourhoods like brave bull's gentrify and change.

mini mini review - la buca



submitted by roland on tue, 03/25/2008 - 22:29 

since we haven't been doing so great at writing restaurant reviews, i'm going to start writing even briefer reviews. la buca (4025 macdonald street, 604.730.6988) is a simply decorated but smart looking restaurant in the middle of nowhere (ok it's in dunbar but there ain't much there).

the great food challenge



submitted by barb on wed, 01/16/2008 - 14:38 

i love a good food challenge. not that food should be challenging. i just like to push myself a bit, think out of the box and try out new ingredients, cooking methods and flavours. we have been thrown the ultimate challenge. the kid has undergone some preliminary allergy testing and we have to put him on a 2 week food elimination trial: -no shellfish-no wheat-no rice-no eggsno shellfish, no problem. we're not huge shellfish eaters.no wheat. ok...no eggs. fine.no rice. what?! he's asian! what's he going to eat?!

baking bread



submitted by barb on mon, 12/03/2007 - 18:29 

i can't remember the last time i bought a loaf of "regular" bread. "regular" bread meaning a loaf of whole wheat or multigrain sandwich bread. over the last few months i've been experimenting with different whole wheat bread recipes and have come up with one that i'm happy with.this loaf is pretty basic: whole wheat and unbleached flours, yeast, butter, honey, water, salt. the variations are limitless: vary the proportion of whole wheat to unbleached flours, throw in other flour or grains, seeds or nuts.
