what's new?





 
cutting through the clutter, our new ai-powered summary feature harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to condense marathon message board discussions into snappy summaries. now, at the top of every topic page, with at least 100 replies, you will see a new "view summary" button. click that button to got to our new topic summary page, because who has time for endless scrolling when you can get the bite-sized brilliance at a glance?
03/11/24





 
we're super exited to announce another small feature to enhance your site experience - youtube embedded videos. now, any youtube video you put into your post will automatically be viewable within the post itself.  no longer will a link redirect you to youtube, rather you can simply watch youtube videos directly from within your posts. you're welcome!!
03/09/24





 
we like nothing better than giving you more freedom and ease when using our site. to that end, we just added a new "quick reply" section at the bottom of the thread view page. we did this to give you a fast, simple way to quickly reply to a thread. however, don't expect all the bells and whistles on this new quick reply feature. it's designed for speed and ease vs complex functionality.
07/25/23





 
to help you stay better connected with the topics you're interested in, we expanded our notification system to notify you when an inactive thread that you've participated on becomes active again.  these new activity emails are sent when there is new activity on a topic that has been dormant for 30 days or more. of course, as with all our other notifications, you can opt out of this new feature from your profile page if you don't want to receive these emails.

they say perfection is in the details, that's why we like adding even small features to our site to make a more robust user experience. in our latest update we expanded on our "thumbs up" message board feature (indicating you liked a post), to allow members to also give a "thumbs down" to posts. thumbs up and thumbs down are a feature found on many online communities and social media sites. this is a quick easy way to express your like or dislike of content, creating opportunities for you to have a more personalized experience.
