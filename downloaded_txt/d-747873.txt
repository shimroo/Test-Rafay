ernest
holmes 

(1887
- 1960)

founder
of the religious science movement







ernest
holmes founded
the
international religious
science
movement, wrote "the science of mind" and numerous other books
on metaphysics, and originated the international periodical science
of mind magazine, which has been in continuous publication
since
1927.
holmes' science of mind teaching, recognized today as one of the
leading
viewpoints in modern metaphysics, is a spiritual philosophy that has
brought
to people around the world a working cosmology - a sense of their
relationship
to god and their place in the universe - and a positive, supportive
approach
to daily living.
ernest
holmes was born
in
1887 on a small maine farm, the youngest of nine sons. as a teenager,
he
attended bethel preparatory school, but he spent most of his time
out-of-doors,
asking himself "what is god? who am i? why am i here?" he mentally
tangled with all the local preachers and doubted the answers he got in
church. at the age of 18 he left school and formal education and set
out
on his lifelong course of independent thinking. he went to boston,
worked
in a grocery store, and pursued his studies relentlessly. a year late,
he discovered the writings of ralph waldo emerson. "reading emerson
is like drinking water to me," he said later. his metaphysical studies
intensified, his quest for truth leading him to literature, art,
science,
philosophy, and religion, and in particular the christian science
teachings
of mary baker
eddy.
after ernest holmes became
acquainted with the
writings
of emerson and mary baker eddy, he soon was exploring the writings of christian
d. larson, ralph
waldo
trine, horatio dresser and phineas
quimby. holmes was particularly impressed with the new
thought
writings
of larson and eventually abandoned the christian science textbook for
larson's
works.
in
1914, at the age of
25,
ernest moved to venice, california. pursuing his studies, he discovered
the writings of thomas troward, which fed the flame ignited by his
earlier
studies of metaphysics. almost casually, he began speaking on troward's
writings to small but ever-growing groups. without ceremony, his
lifetime
ministry had begun. later, as his audiences grew, he was ordained as a
minister of the divine
science church.
ernest
published his
first
book, "creative mind," in 1919, followed shortly after by another
volume entitled "creative mind and success." he continued his studies,
and lectured
to growing crowds in california and eastern cities. meanwhile, he was
writing
"the science of mind," which was to become the "textbook"
of the religious science philosophy. first published in 1922, it was
originally copyrighted by his wife in 1926, revised
in 1938, and is now in its 45th printing, and has been translated into
french,
german, and japanese. at the time the book was published, his many
enthusiastic
students urged him to set up an incorporated organization. he refused
at
first, but eventually agreed, and the institute of religious science
and
the school of philosophy was incorporated in 1927.



on
october 23, 1927, in los
angeles,
he was married to widowed hazel durkee foster. they were to be
inseparable
companions for thirty years. in
1953,
the institute became the church of religious science. in 1967, it
acquired
its present-day title, united church of religious science, with member
churches throughout the world. on
may 21,
1957, he lost his chosen life-companion.
ernest
holmes made his
transition
to the next experience on april 7, 1960, in los angeles. he left no
children.
but he left all humankind an enduring legacy: the way of life he called
religious science.
on
that way of life, he said
this
in 1958:

"we
have launched a movement
which, in the next 100 years, will be the great new religious impulsion
of modern times, far exceeding, in its capacity to envelop the world,
anything
that has happened since mohammedanism started.
"we
have to have the same
faith
in what we teach and practice that the scientist has, or the gardener
has,
and when that great simplicity shall have plumbed and penetrated this
density
of ours, this human stolidness and stupidity, this debauchery of the
intellect
and the soul, something new and wonderful will happen. it is the only
thing
that will keep the world from destroying itself...."

(abstracted
from the
booklet
path of discovery, prepared by scott awbrey, los angeles united church
of religious science, 1987.)
