december 9, 1992 - february 3, 2007
      fourteen years is a long time! 
      i was a yorkie puppy with a web page when the internet was new and i've had a blessed life. 
      i've met hundreds of great pets and folks,
      i've been on tv, radio, in books, and had millions of page views.  
      i'd like to think i've made a few people say "ahhh" or laugh.  
      as long as you keep clicking, i'll always be with you.  
      there's a lot here to see and hear, so i hope you have fun exploring.
