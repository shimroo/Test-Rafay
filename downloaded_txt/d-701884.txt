here's info about the
                          west coast premiere of the musical coraline,
                          featuring the music and lyrics of stephin merritt,
                          submitted by the sf playhouse:
what:    a
                musical like no other, coraline
                sprang from the minds of three of the most wildly popular cult
                figures
                of our time. adapted from the terrifying children's book by neil
                gaiman
                (author of the international sensation sandman), this tale of
                menace
                and mayhem was set to music and lyrics by smart-rock iconoclast
                stephin
                merritt of the magnetic fields, and boasted a book by celebrated
                downtown actor/playwright, david greenspan (she stoops to
                comedy, dead
                mother).
poor bored coraline. she's left
                to rattle 'round her perpetually distracted, workaholic parents'
                house
                all by her lonesome. but late one night, her dreams of a better
                reality
                come true as she opens a big, carved, wooden door at the far end
                of the
                drawing room and passes into a perfect replica of her own world.
                when
                she's greeted there by a vastly loving other mother and a kindly
                other
                father, she's thrilled! but as the rats start to creep from the
                floorboards, and the way home becomes increasingly unclear,
                coraline
                begins to suspect that, perhaps, all is not as perfect as it
                seems.

                          features songs inspired by the stories of neil gaiman
                          (sandman, american
                            gods, coraline).

                          june 11, 2006, merritt participated in an eight-hour
                          performance of
                          "vexations" by erik satie, a piece which is repeated
                          840 times when
                          played according to satie's specification.  this
                          event, called
                          pianoless vexations, featured various musicians
                          including alan licht,

                           the conference had the theme of "ain't
                            that a shame": loving music in the shadow of doubt,
                          and some
                            of merritt's comments sparked a few reactions,
                          to say the least.
