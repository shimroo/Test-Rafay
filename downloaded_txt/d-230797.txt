there is no comparison between link computer and other it companies!   
before link, i did allot of guessing and searching on google for network answers. the single biggest benefit to working with link computer is their dedicated help desk and the availability and knowledge of the specialists answering their phones.
the responsiveness of link’s help desk is unmatched. their experts are always ready to help. link is second-to-none.
if you are on the fence, just ask a link customer about the quality work and services provided by their team. there is no comparison between link computer and other it companies!

link computer corporation is the #1 choice for all your it support needs. 
link has a wide range of resources and it specialists available to cover any need that arises with my organization. i know that i can reach out to link with any question and get answers i need.
unlike other companies, link is invested in the success of the local business community.
if you simply want someone to just “do a job”, there are others you can call. if you want a company with the experience and knowledge on what “needs be done”, then link computer corporation is the #1 choice for all your it support needs.

the biggest benefit of choosing link would be the responsiveness of the team.
the biggest benefit of choosing link would first be the responsiveness of the team. mike, aaron, and the helpdesk folks have surpassed expectations on their timely assistance to run-of-the-mill issues, projects, and everything else we need.
second, the link team has been willing to educate our folks on how things work, why they believe something should be redone or set up in a particular way, and any other questions we have about our it environment.
the team at link has been 100% upfront and fair. they’re willing to work with us on budgets for projects and being open and visible with the work that they do.
the link team has been incredibly helpful – while the it world moves to being remote, they’ve been willing and able to come on site to help resolve issues on the drop of a dime (including afterhours issues). we have yet to have a business disruption last more than a few minutes, and all other issues have been resolved well under their sla.

choose link! you won’t be disappointed. 
the link bdr solution has taken an absolute load off of my mind knowing that the backups are being monitored by the link team of engineers.  in the past, i might have missed something when it was up to me to monitor, track, fix the backups as well as run the it department. we can always count on link to reach out proactively when something fails and resolve any issue that might arise.
i like the personal touch that link has compared to the other firms.  there is an actual relationship between link and their clients while really understanding their needs.  link (dan g, especially) takes the time to learn about your business and doesn’t try to just make a sale.  they look for the solution that best fits your needs.
choose link! you won’t be disappointed.  it’s been over 15 years and i have never been disappointed with link.
