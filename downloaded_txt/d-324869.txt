there were 14 categories of animals in the world: belonging to the emperor embalmed tame sucking pigs sirens fabulous stray dogs included in the present classification frenzied innumerable drawn with a fine camelhair brush et cetera having just broken the water pitcher that from a long way off look like flies - ancient chinese encyclopedia

			apprehend in one great leap, the thing that, by means of the fable,
			is demonstrated as the exotic charm of another system of thought, is the limitation of
