“my friends and i rented a hemlock cabin for a wedding over the weekend. what an awesome time! the location is absolutely gorgeous. we took a stroll around the lake and it was just perfect. the cabin was large and perfect for everyone to get ready and hangout in. the complimentary row boat was awesome.”nicole, google

  











 









 

“third time was a charm (as were the first and second stays)this place is an absolute gem among the many has-been and somewhat disappointing resorts in the poconos. it retains its rustic charm well while still having the luxurious touches you'd expect at the price point. we've stayed in the cabins and in the new suites, and both are exemplary among their peers in the poconos. the suites have showers you'd expect to see at the st. regis or the four seasons as well as lovely fireplaces. the cabins have their own docks with rowboats and truly feel like a quiet lake retreat that is increasingly hard to find. the nature trail is great for hiking and running, and the beaches are fun with playground equipment (that even adults can use).”daniel, trip advisor
