the one that started it all: 
stiletto!  a 1/4 scale r/c model of my america's cup winning us 203. it has many of the same features found on full size land yachts.  

i including a double-tapered wing mast and weight-tuned suspension.  stiletto is not a "sailboat on wheels", rather, it is a true land yacht model. with a top speed of over 30 mph, you won't find a better kit anywhere. if you are looking for a model land yacht, here it is.

the stiletto,as well as s1 and s2 model kits are no longer available 



























mly bat 1 (version 2 and 3)

meanwhile, the bat has been extensively tested and praised by customers.
sadly the bat 1, produced by hobby king was phased out. h.k. also declined merging into the bat 2 line. knowing this i purchased a major amount of hulls to be able to continue to offer both bat 1 and bat 2 models.
not having had  any control of the materials used by hobby king bat 1, mly bat models  include updates and upgrades.
of course mly cannot match  hobby kings production prices of 2013 
as with the bat 2 the mly bat 1 can be ordered in the hull color of your choice at no extra cost.
colors usually in stock are: white, yellow, blue, red and orange, black
bat 1 version 2 (without radio) is offered with shipping and handling to the contintinental usa at $225 and internationally at $295.

bat 1 version 3 (with radio) is offered only within the continental usa. the price including shipping and handling is $245.
please send me an e-mail to get a complete price for your model shipped to your door step.

help for mly bat 1 and 2 sailors
bat instructions are now available.




























sailing model land yachts is a sport with a solid base of dedicated enthusiasts and racers who appreciate landsailing because it is easy to learn and challenging to master. it is an inexpensive sport; whether you're just beginning or a seasoned racer. races involve groups ranging from local clubs to international competitors. and, it's environmentally friendly! in fact, the u.s. bureau of land management has rewarded racers and enthusiasts with special access to dry lakes for competitions. it's an increasingly popular sport that is enjoyed by a diverse range of people.
the models i have developed are the result of years of racing experience and technical knowledge of the particular mechanics of landsailers. while there are some similarities (both sailboat and landsailer have a sail, for example), there are some fairly distinct differences between them: most notably.......speed! think of half a high-performance glider (airplane)....on edge and on wheels, and you're beginning to get the idea. 
models are designed by three-time america's landsailing cup winner, long-time r/c modeler, and all-around interesting person robert weber.  he has been landsailing since 1986 and has traveled the world for the sport: participating in international competitions in europe and australia 






















unpainted models
all models come black unpainted, although you may choose a color on the b1 and b2 at no extra charge.hull colors usually in stock are: red ,orange, white, blue, yellow.

bat 2 information
the bat 1 designed by me,  produced and sold by hobby king introduced the world to rc model land sailing. it has been successfully sold worldwide.several attempts to merge into the bat 2 line were declined by hobby king.
by using the basic hull of the bat 1 i developed the bat 2due to its larger class 2 size, a perfectly tuned suspension and a flexible mast, the bat 2 acts like its glued to the ground as it accelerates to unbelievable speeds, while allowing great control by the pilot.
