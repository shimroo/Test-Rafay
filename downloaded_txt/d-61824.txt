self-esteem 
              takes practice...

imagine 
                you could play a computer game for five minutes each morning that 
                would help you feel more secure and confident in yourself. our 
                research shows that people may
                be able to change the negative thought patterns that sometimes
                produce insecurity. we are now examining whether over time, with
                practice, people can develop positive, beneficial habits of thought
                to help them become more secure and self-confident on a long
                term basis -- whether in the context of their working life, their
                personal relationships, or their overall sense of well being.
                since 2006, these games are being developed and marketed
                by mindhabits inc.
