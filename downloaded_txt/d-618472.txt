just sayin





i haven't been posting much on this blog, so i'll go ahead and just write something on my mind lately:  health care.  omg.  i've pretty much stopped watching the news because the debate is so lame.by lame, i mean it's two groups arguing different points.  liberals want everybody covered.  conservatives don't want government competing in the marketplace.i'm of the opinion....both groups are right.  i don't really like the idea of the government creating a new corporation (in essence) with infinitely deep pockets (taxes) that can compete with "real" businesses that have to have profits to succeed.  if government is offering healthcare, it should do it 100% (and i'm not convinced that's a bad idea).but i really don't like the way things are now with profits being greater by kicking sick people off the rolls.what i don't understand is:  why not go a third way?  regulation.liberals can easily point out different aspects of business practices that are harming health spending in this country.  in fact, i'll bet there are several that both sides could agree on.so why not target those issues with legislation (e.g., make it illegal to exclude someone for a pre-existing condition)?  a mixed economy works for almost every other huge industry in the country...why not this one?
