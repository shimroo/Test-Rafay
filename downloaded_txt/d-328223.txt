                bacdive
            

                the bacterial diversity metadatabase
            

our metadatabase of organism-linked information covering the multifarious aspects of bacterial and archaeal biodiversity.  




                tygs
            

                type (strain) genome server
            

tygs offers a truly genome-based classification and identification of prokaryotic strains without overestimating phylogenetic confidence.






                lpsn
            

                list of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature
            

lpsn is a compilation of all names of bacteria & archaea which have been validly published according to the bacteriological code.




                short tandem repeat (str) profile search
            

                analysis of short tandem repeats
            

since str microsatellites are stable as well as highly polymorphic in human populations, str profiling is shown to be ideal for authentication of human cell line samples.
