the gospel is central






we, the members of christ community church, join together in the fellowship of the gospel.
we will not forsake the assembling of ourselves together for worship and service. we will cherish the regular preaching and teaching of god’s word and the faithful observance of baptism and the lord’s supper (heb. 10:25, 2 tim. 3:16-17).
