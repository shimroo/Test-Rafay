welcome to the 
free site dedicated to obtaining, creating, and presenting
            texas cemeteries as they are today. this project began as "west
            texas cemeteries" a small site of just 9 counties. today the
              site covers the 254 counties  of tx at  plus some of the
              surrounding states of new mexico, oklahoma, louisiana,
              arkansas.   the  goal is to obtain cemetery histories, inscription
            records, directions and photographs of each cemetery or burial
            ground. so feel free to browse all you want, and check back often,
            because things are added daily.  hope you enjoy.
