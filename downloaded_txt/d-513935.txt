aerospace repair services
schaeffler aerospace  understands that modern aerospace applications demand rolling element bearings that combine the highest quality and reliability. this is why, through expert diagnosis and repair, we can restore bearings to an as-new condition in less time, for less cost and to the high standards expected from aerospace experts.











repair station service include: cleaning, inspection, repair and alteration of roller bearings, ball bearings, and bearing journal surfaces aerospace, military, rail, and industrial applications barden, fag, ina and competitor postitions global network oem, design organization and der approvals refurbishment advantages vs. new production include: lower cost-less than purchase of new replacement hardware (aftermarket) better availability and turn around time (ex. 3 weeks vs. 26 weeks new) less schedule risk-periodically raw material is scarce and industry capacity short. 







general refurbishment practices








level 1: cleaning  non-destructive testing visual and geometric inspection minor buffing 






level 2: replacement of rolling elements rework (replacement) of cages raceway honing 






level 4: replacement of inner ring replacement of cage
