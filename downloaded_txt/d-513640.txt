theoretical condensed matter physics is
      about building models of physical processes, often driven by experimental
      data, generalising the solutions of those models to make 
      predictions, and transferring the concepts gained into other areas.
      theory plays an important role in understanding known phenomena
      and in predicting new ones.
with over seventy members, tcm is the largest university
      condensed matter theory group in the country.  able to trace its
      history back for over sixty years, it has been home to many leading
      theoreticians.




news

tcm congratulates dr michele
  simoncelli as he moves to
  start his
  own group at columbia university, new york, as an assistant
  professor. there he will continue his computational and theoretical
  research into quantum transport phenomena in solids and liquids,
  and their applications to sustainable technologies, research which
  has already led to commercial collaborations. we are pleased too
  that he will continue to collaborate with tcm after he leaves.
