cooperativeunlike other financial institutions, credit unions are cooperative organizations owned and controlled by the people who use their services. profits go back into enhancing your banking experience and strengthening your community, not into the portfolios of outside shareholders.

localcredit unions believe there's no better place to invest than the communities they serve. that's why every year a portion of profits are used to fund charitable initiatives, sponsorships, scholarships, and other things that help make our neighbourhoods great places to live.

democraticcredit unions are cooperatives, collectively owned by the people who use their services. if you have a credit union account, you have a democratic say when it comes to policy and decision-making. by voting for your credit union's board of directors - or running yourself - you help guide the credit union on its path.
























personalcredit unions are smaller and more localized than other financial institutions, so members are treated with a more personal touch. that means getting to know you, and providing you with the right tools for your individual needs. no cookie-cutter solutions. the success of every member matters, and building strong relationships is a fundamental part of what credit unions do.














manitobanthe vast majority of the funds credit union members deposit are recirculated in our communities in the form of loans to homeowners, businesses, farmers and other members. credit unions are not in the habit of financing ventures in other provinces - not with so many worthy and viable enterprises in our own backyard! all decisions, big and small, are made right here in manitoba communities - not on bay street.
























everywherethere are twice as many credit union locations in manitoba as any other financial institution. in many communities, a credit union is the only financial institution servicing residents, small businesses and producers. that's because credit unions care about providing high-quality financial services to everyone, no matter the size of your community. it's all about driving growth and prosperity right here in our province.
