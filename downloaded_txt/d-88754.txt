it's the perfect boat for us to hop in and explore lakes and inlets. ian and justin don't just sell you a boat, they are committed to keeping these boats in tip-top shape, and their customer service stays with each boat they build. they are incredibly responsive and helpful. we even wrote a limerick for our dory:"a couple who dreamt of being afloatlooked high and low ‘til they found the right boatnow they’re adrift in a bright green craftthe dory that takes them fore and aft"black squirrel12:19 17 jan 25these guys are the best. their boats are works of art and the best of their kind. i had a vermont pack boat for 18 years and it served me well, at 12’ long we were able to beat rowing boats over 16’ long with two oarsmen. they also hold their value like no other boat you can buy.jim phelan11:39 17 jan 25we love our yellow hull 14 ft. vermont dory.  it rows great and is a beautiful thing to behold.  we put the rowing seat in the boat and it is a great workout.james illg06:11 17 jan 25i own the 14' vermont dory and it is capable of so much more than just day trips on quiet lakes.  my dog and i have done week long trips to the apostle islands on lake superior, to the minnesota boundary waters,  to utah's lake powell and to voyagers national park.  this summer we're headed to the north shore of lake superior.this boat is stable, well made, will take you places in style and it's a joy to row.  with such a boat you can reach remote and beautiful places and yet you can car-top it and manage it easily.jeremy cornwall18:59 16 jul 24i bought a guideboat from them 15 years ago and have loved it.  i've had a couple problems over the years and i contacted them about the problems today and they couldn't have been nicer.  they gave me brand new parts, for free, to fix my problems.  thank you so much justin!indianamelonhead01:56 29 apr 24the guideboat's alluring tumblehome stems, sweeping sheer, unique history, reputation, and mystique got my attention decades ago.  this spring i finally had agb build me their composite version and now i can experience the magic myself.  the martin brothers, justin and ian, answered all my questions and were attentive to my choices as we discussed options for my boat.  ian delivered her in april, and she sits in the garage where she's easy and convenient to admire frequently -- which i do.  the boat is gorgeous, the cherry trim is flawless and the fancy pins and oarlock straps are like jewelry.  i've already had her on the water twice this season, and she is absolutely living up to expectations.  i imagine anyone who takes their first pull on the 8 ft. oars will be amazed.  the boat moves with a flowing, frictionless glide with little effort, and tracks beautifully, too.  all this and top tier customer relations and service.  thank you, agb!ann plumley12:19 19 apr 24from the very start of our adirondack guideboat adventure, justin and ian have been accessible, accommodating and generous with their expertise. they quickly and creatively made upgrades to our new 12’ solo pack boat, customizing it to our needs and preferences. we appreciated their advice and wisdom. we have been hard-pressed to recall any purchase of anything, anywhere that was as seamless, pleasant and joyful as this. terrific guideboat, expertly made by two guys who want you to love guideboating as much as they do. pure pleasure!bill magnus18:15 02 oct 15i have had one of these boats for a few years. it is pure joy to row. not sure i have enjoyed anything as much. i tell folks its like the boat is on roller bearings or in space, there is so little friction. pull on those 8' oars at your own risk, you'll be in a different time zone before you know it!! i was told you could row at 6 knots. i believe that to be true even though i am considered by most to be pretty old.beyond the speed and ease of movement, there is the joy of being in a crafted environment. caned seats, fine wood fit up, brass and a wonderful fiberglass hull make this quite a nice craft you will be proud to own. my neighbors love it and love to see me out rowing in it.these guideboats are not cheap but when you divide the joy you get, number of years you will enjoy this boat and overall craftsmanship, the price per year is quite attractive          feb 13, 2025 – feb 16, 2025 the cny boat show and sale join adirondack guideboat at the cny boat show and sale at the nys fairgrounds the expo center & exhibit center, syracuse, ny. come see our latest models and our selection of top-notch used watercraft in close to 200,000 square feet of boating paradise!
