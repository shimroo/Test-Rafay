nope. still can't properly open ketchup packets.





i feel i've become more self conscious and inhibited.for example, anything i think is worth blogging about turns into a 'no one wants to hear about that!'-type internal dialogue minutes later.like right now, i'm thinking: what are you typing? no one wants to read about your insecurities.i'm afraid this is all i've got for the moment.anyway.today there was a piece in the paper about a mufti denouncing "faking one's virginity."last week there was another one talking about how women should not be allowed to go on the internet without a male guardian present.it amazes me how these people handle issues of this magnitude with such grace.i mean, really?that's what you want to talk about?what will it take for these people to wake up?it's not cute anymore.saudis will get me on this;why is everyone in this country so angry about the dubai metro?i know we're jealous of the progress the uae has made, but really we need to stop hating.ubergirl

this is actually happening





so the good people in qatar want a meeting of arab and muslim nations to talk about what's going on in gaza.and a few days before that's set to happen, saudi arabia holds a meeting of its own, basically urging arab and muslim countries not to go to the summit in qatar.meow!i am getting total dejavu. this has happened before, i'm sure of it...when, though?oh, right.high school.what the fuck?can't we, for once, shut the fuck up, and not embarrass me?god damn it, only today 65 people died. and this is what we're doing.great job, governments of the world. really.ubergirl

prayer is all you can give them. (and ofcourse, there's always  sorcery...)





i don't think i've ever been more selfish than i have these last two months. i have not been aware of anything that has gone on outside of my own head.as a result, i have neglected everything from my school work to this blog, and i apologize.i want the world to work. i really, really do. and, to a certain extent, i still do not understand why it doesn't. i might be young and naive, i might still have that wide-eyed, childlike view of the world, but for the life of me i don't get why we can't all just get along. i don't understand how casual violence and murder has become. and to be completely honest, i hope i never do.and so, i reluctantly watched the news for the first time in two months, and it made me cry. again.because people are dying, and in my country i am not allowed to stand in the street and hold up a sign. i am not given the right of silent, peaceful protest.please give blood to the injured in gaza. there are blood drives in most hospitals in riyadh, kfh among them.may god be with them. may god give them strength. and may god forgive us all.ubergirl
