visiting
this site:
 


why you may not be
getting
the lagest version of this or any site. 

on a subsequent
visit to any site, you may end up loading from your disk cache an old
version
of the web page, (this includes every page in the site), you
will not get the up-dates. it's
usually
much faster to load from cache so this may give you an indication that
you are loading the page from your disk storage.
if you are
using netscape hold down the shift key and click on reload. this
sometimes
forces a reload from the server. checking your page info does not
always
work, (that was a surprise to me). you may have to empty your cache as
a last resort
