our story




by popular demand

                            most wine brands must work to build up a customer following. in a reversal of the usual order of things, merry edwards launched her namesake label only after a small group of avid collectors begged her to go solo.                        

in her role as winemaker for prominent producers such as mt. eden vineyards and matanzas creek winery in the 1970s and ’80s, merry garnered much critical acclaim, which she parlayed into a prosperous career as a consulting winemaker. throughout the years, a cadre of enthusiasts eagerly followed her work as she moved from project to project. finally, a small group of these collectors convinced her to strike out on her own, backing up their support with a seed investment. merry would go on to earn accolades including “winemaker of the year” recognition from the san francisco chronicle, and naming her as one of “the 50 most influential winemakers in the world” by wine and spirits magazine.
