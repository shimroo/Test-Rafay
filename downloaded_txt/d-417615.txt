 the postfix home page
 all programmers are optimists  -- frederick p.
brooks, jr.  
 first of all, thank you for your interest in the postfix project.

 what is postfix? it is wietse venema's mail
server that started life at ibm
research as an alternative to the widely-used sendmail program.  after eight
years at google, wietse continues to maintain postfix. 
 postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure.
the outside has a definite sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is
completely different.  

 about this website 
 this website has information about the postfix source code
distribution. built from source code, postfix can run on unix-like
systems including aix, bsd, hp-ux, linux, macos x, solaris, and
more. 
 postfix is also distributed as ready-to-run code by operating
system vendors, appliance vendors, and other providers.  their
versions may have small differences with the software that is
described on this website.
