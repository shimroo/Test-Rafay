land acknowledgement
the minneapolis college of art and design (mcad) acknowledges it is located on traditional, ancestral, and contemporary lands of indigenous people. this is the ancestral homeland of the dakota and ojibwe people, who were forcibly exiled from the land because of aggressive and persistent settler colonialism. we recognize that this place has a complex and layered history. as a community dedicated to creativity, mcad is committed to ongoing efforts to support and advocate for american indian nations and peoples.
