				welcome to my pom 
			page. i am a very small show confirmation enthusiast, specializing in exotics.  
			i am an active member and current officer of
				columbia pomeranian club, 
					and of the 
					american pomeranian club.  all of my dogs are akc 
			registered, and most are also ukc registered.  we are also involved in a fulfilling, 
					pomeranian and other petite breeds, rescue program
				www.displacedpetsrescue.com.  located 
			halfway between portland and the oregon coast on a wonderful six 
			acre plot of forestland we are living in our dream spot.  we 
					have plenty of space for the great family bonfire activities and our babies get lots of outdoor 
			exercise.
the puppies shown on this page are not for sale.

since i began showing i have 
			found that i had learned way more than i thought i needed to learn; 
			and that the learning will never end.  there is always some new.  
					finding, some theory to be contradicted and some knowledge 
					to be challenged is a way of live.  i 
			caught the show bug... and it is sooo addicting.  not only have 
			i caught that bug, i am hooked on trying to produce, and show, 
			quality in exotic colors and markings
					(i always have been up for a 
			challenge.)
i have changed my personal 
			opinions many times, over many things (i also found that i had a lot 
			of opinions based totally in ignorance).  i have learned that 
			there is no end to the learning experiences, as with the joy of 
			loving these tiny creatures.  definitely my ways of thinking 
			have changed dramatically.  
i love that  
					two of my granddaughters are also wanting to be involved.  
					this is a great sport for helping kids to come out of their 
					shell, learning confidence and grace.  i just wish they 
					lived closer so they could come to more shows with me.


 











god has a time for everything, a perfect schedule. 
							he is never too soon, never too late. 
			the when of 
							his will is as important as the what and the how.-- richard c. halverson



			god, 
							grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot 
							change, the courage to change the things i can, and 
							the wisdom to know the difference.




here's a couple bits of 
				unsolicited advice.there are things that i see 
				repeated over and over, these aren't unique to the dog world, 
				but are seen in every "community" where people love what they 
				do.  people talk, they also watch.  practice what you 
				preach.  if you going to preach your beliefs at everyone 
				around you, then you had best be living up to them, else why would 
				anyone listen to the preaching.  if you aren't living up to 
				your preaching it won't be long before everything being said is 
				discredited.  
base your opinions on fact, not rumor.  life is too 
			short to waste it forming opinions that are based in ignorance, lies 
				and manipulation.  
			ask direct questions and take them to the source, as one persons 
			tale is most often not reality, but some twisted aspect of that.  
				before spreading the gossip - ask yourself a couple of 
				questions:  "is this any of my business?" "what if it were me 
				that was being talked about?"  and "how would i feel 
				if this people were talking about me this way?"  remember the "telephone game" when 
			listening to the 
			gossips.  it is a fun game, but truly is what happens in life.
be open to the opinions of others, there is much to 
			be appreciated in most.  i am a firm believer that we get what 
					we give.  if we are open, honest, kind and supportive 
					in what we do, that will come back to us 100 fold.  lastly, enjoy live, have fun with it, 
				be kind and supportive to those who are learning and those who
					know it all.after all without the fun what's the point???"





too busy for a friend....




						one day a teacher asked her students to list the names 
						of the other students in the room on two sheets of 
						paper, leaving a space between each name.

then she told them to think of the nicest thing they 
						could say about each of their classmates and write it 
						down.

						it took the remainder of the class period to finish 
						their assignment, and as the students left the room, 
						each one handed in the papers.

						that 
						saturday, the teacher wrote down the name of each 
						student on a separate sheet of paper, and listed what 
						everyone else had said about that individual. 

						on monday 
						she gave each student his or her list. before long, the 
						entire class was smiling. 'really?' she heard whispered. 
						'i never knew that i meant anything to anyone!' and, 'i 
						didn't know others liked me so much,' were most of the 
						comments.

						 no 
						one ever mentioned those papers in class again. she 
						never knew if they discussed them after class or with 
						their parents, but it didn't matter. the exercise had 
						accomplished its purpose. the students were happy with 
						themselves and one another. that group of students moved 
						on.

						 several 
						years later, one of the students was killed in vietnam 
						 and his teacher attended the funeral of that special 
						student. she had never seen a serviceman in a military 
						coffin before. he looked so handsome, so mature.

						 the 
						church was packed with his friends. one by one those who 
						loved him took a last walk by the coffin. the teacher 
						was the last one to bless the coffin.

						 as 
						she stood there, one of the soldiers who acted as 
						pallbearer  came up to her. 'were you mark's math 
						teacher?' he asked. she nodded: 'yes.' then he said: 
						'mark talked about you a lot.'


						after the 
						funeral, most of mark's former classmates went together 
						to a luncheon. mark's mother and father were there, 
						obviously waiting to speak with his teacher.

						'we want 
						to show you something,' his father said, taking a wallet 
						out of his pocket 'they found this on mark when he was 
						killed. we thought you might recognize it.'

opening 
						the billfold, he carefully removed two worn pieces of 
						notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and 
						refolded many times.. the teacher knew without looking 
						that the papers were the ones on which she had listed 
						all the good things each of mark's classmates had said 
						about him.

						'thank 
						you so much for doing that,' mark's mother said. 'as you 
						can see, mark treasured it.'

all of 
						mark's former classmates started to gather around. 
						charlie smiled rather sheepishly and said, 'i still have 
						my list. it's in the top drawer of my desk at home.'

						 chuck's 
						wife said, 'chuck asked me to put his in our wedding 
						album.'

'i have 
						mine too,' marilyn said. 'it's in my diary'

						then 
						vicki, another classmate, reached into her pocketbook, 
						took out her wallet and showed her worn and frazzled 
						list to the group. 'i carry this with me at all times,' 
						vicki said and without batting an eyelash, she 
						continued: 'i think we all saved our lists'

						 that's 
						when the teacher finally sat down and cried. she cried 
						for mark and for all his friends who would never see him 
						again.

						 
						the density of people in society is so thick that we 
						forget that life will end one day. and we don't know 
						when that one day will be. 

						 so 
						please, tell the people you love and care for, that they 
						are special and important. tell them, before it is too 
						late.

remember, 
						you reap what you sow.
						what you put into the lives of 
						others comes back into your own.
