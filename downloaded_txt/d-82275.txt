welcome to catholic memorial

the value of a catholic memorial education is derived from a mindset of excellence in the classroom, on the field and through extra-curricular participation. the cm faculty teach and coach through methods attuned to how boys relate to information, creating in them ingenuity, adaptability and self-made success. cm forges leaders who are faith-filled, have a strong work ethic and who know right from wrong. our graduates attend america's most respected universities and colleges becoming leaders across boston in business, law, government, military and public safety. a cm education builds platforms on which our students can stand with confidence and look you in the eye while shaking your hand. cm is a brotherhood rooted in authentic diversity and fraternal trust and is a city of boston school where character matters as much today as it has since its founding in 1957.
