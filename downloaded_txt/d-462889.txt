  wellness readiness action plan (wrap):
   
  the wrap is a self-management and recovery system.  wrap is 
              designed to:
  · decrease 
              and prevent intrusive or troubling feelings and behaviors
  · increase 
              personal empowerment
  · improve 
              quality of life
  · assist 
              people in achieving their own life goals and dreams.
   
  individual wrap plans provide participants with a personally 
              developed road map of their goals, objectives and wellness 
              resources that may be used to further their recovery.  a wrap 
              also maps out potential actions and skills that can be used in 
              periods of symptom reoccurrence. the wrap can help one to 
              reduce, modify or eliminate symptoms by using planned 
              responses.  this form of self directed planning empowers 
              participants to take charge of and be responsible for their own 
              recovery.
   
  the wrap is taught generally over a five day period, with each 
              day lasting about  five-hours.  the class is taught by web staff 
              and is held  approximately once per month.  the class schedule 
              varies from month to month.  please call hosanna at 222-2980 for 
              questions or to sign up for a class.  the class is free.  





  peer mentoring
  one  basic philosophy of the alaska mental health consumer web 
              and of peer support is that the development of relationships is 
              a crucial component of recovery. the web views recovery as more 
              than the ending of substance abuse or lessening of symptoms of 
              mental health issues.  recovery is life changing.  participants 
              find that a   peer mentor   is a valuable tool for recovery.    a peer mentor engages participants in regaining control over 
              their lives and over their recovery process.  peer mentors model 
              competency in recovery and maintaining ongoing wellness.   
   
   
  our hours of operation are m-f 8:30-5:00; saturday 10:00-4:00; 
              closed sunday.
