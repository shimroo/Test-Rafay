simple mathematcal pattern describes shape of neuron 'jungle'




2:52 pm

discovery


neurons look remarkably like trees, and connect to other cells with  many branches that effectively act like wires in an electrical circuit,  carrying impulses that represent sensation, emotion, thought and action.
over 100 years ago, santiago ramon y cajal, the father of modern  neuroscience, sought to systematically describe the shapes of neurons,  and was convinced that there must be a unifying principle underlying  their diversity.
cajal proposed that neurons spread out their branches so as to use as  little wiring as possible to reach other cells in the network. reducing  the amount of wiring between cells provides additional space to pack  more neurons into the brain, and therefore increases its processing  power.
new work by ucl neuroscientists, published recently in proceedings of the national academy of sciences,  has revisited this century-old hypothesis using modern computational  methods. they show that a simple computer program which connects points  with as little wiring as possible can produce tree-like shapes which are  indistinguishable from real neurons -- and also happen to be very  beautiful. they also show that the shape of neurons follows a simple  mathematical relationship called a power law.
power laws have been shown to be common across the natural world, and  often point to simple rules underlying complex structures. dr herman  cuntz (ucl wolfson institute for biomedical research) and colleagues  find that the power law holds true for many types of neurons gathered  from across the animal kingdom, providing strong evidence for ramon y  cajal's general principle.
the ucl team further tested the theory by examining neurons in the  olfactory bulb, a part of the brain where new brain cells are constantly  being formed. these neurons grow and form new connections even in the  adult brain, and therefore provide a unique window into the rules behind  the development of neural trees in a mature neural circuit.
the team analysed the change in shape of the newborn olfactory  neurons over several days, and found that the growth of these neurons  also follow the power law, providing further evidence to support the  theory.dr hermann cuntz said: "the ultimate goal of neuroscience is to  understand how the impenetrable neural jungle can give rise to the  complexity of behaviour.
"our findings confirm cajal's original far-reaching insight that  there is a simple pattern behind the circuitry, and provides hope that  neuroscientists will someday be able to see the forest for the trees."










'facebook for animals' tested on wild great tits




2:51 pm

discovery


how animals associate in groups can have important consequences in  terms of the health and survival of both individuals and whole  populations; influencing factors such as the spread of disease and the  ability to find food or mates.
but revealing the networks underlying animal societies is a challenge  when a large amount of fieldwork data consists of a long stream of  automated observations of the times and locations of individuals,  leaving scientists to try and reconstruct the 'big picture' of how  individuals are connected.
the new approach can automatically identify periods of intense social  activity within a large number of observations -- in this example  around one million observations of wild great tits (parus major). this  makes it possible to examine these periods in greater detail and  calculate which individuals are real 'friends', rather than random  passers-by, and even which are looking to pair up and mate.
a report of the research is published in this week's journal of the royal society interface.
'if you think of the data about you in facebook it records things  like who you are friends with, where you've been, and what you share  with others,' said ioannis psorakis of oxford university's department of  engineering science, who led the research. 'what we have shown is that  we can analyse data about individual animals, in this case great tits,  to construct a 'facebook for animals' revealing who affiliates with who,  who are members of the same group, and which birds are regularly going  to the same gatherings or 'events.''
they team tested the new technique on data from two breeding seasons  of wild great tits (august 2007-march 2008 and august 2008-march 2009).  the data came from transponders attached to thousands of birds and  sensors that logged when individuals appeared at any one of 67 bird  feeders spread throughout wytham woods, oxford.
the researchers found that their predictions from this data about  which birds were 'friends' that regularly foraged for food together, as  well as which birds were starting the process of pairing up or were  already in a pair, matched visual observations made by zoologists.
'what we've shown is that our technique can extract information about  the networks that bind individuals together by sampling and analysing  their mobility patterns,' said ioannis psorakis. 'our approach makes it  possible to look at huge amounts of data without having to decide what  time resolution is best to extract meaning -- the model evaluates this  automatically. this is just the first exalple of how zoologists are  beginning to use our method to explore social networks of animals in a  'big data' context.'
early results from the work with great tits suggest that individual  birds do not participate in flocks at random, but have a bias towards  other members of the population they interact with. the majority of  networks extracted using the approach are strongly clustered, and in  such tight bird communities, individuals forage together and interact  with their current or future mating partner.
this approach is being used not only in great tits, but also in a mix  of wild-bird social networks, exploring the animal sociality at an  inter-species level. some of the most important future steps in this  work are to combine the 'social' information available through this  method, with other types of information: for example combining it with  genetic data is enabling researchers to explore the genetic basis of  sociality: do genetically similar individuals attract each other, or is  it the other way round? can we find specific areas of the genome that  account for gregariousness?
the work could also help researchers understand how information  spreads through animal populations. tits are a famous exemplar of social  learning: for instance, the habit of pecking open milk bottles on  doorsteps to get access to cream spread rapidly through england in the  mid 20th century. the new approach is helping scientists to test how  specific social structures help or hinder the spread of novel  information from individual to individual.
