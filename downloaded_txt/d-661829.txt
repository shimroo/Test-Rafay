website design is what we do for you  plus s.e.o. !    we design, build, maintain as your webmaster, a unique website for you as a small business owner. we help you select a domain and hosting, design a logo if you need one, edit your photos, provide search engine meta tags - s.e.o. that is relavant to the page they are on. we help make your choices easy and explain everything you may not understand about having a website or hosting.prices: from $450. to $495. full business site one time fee. & s.e.o included or requested seperately at $50. per hour.   we advise you on sound business practices. you can depend on us to translate computer speak into normal english. we can also photograph your local store and products if you are in the metro richmond va area.we create websites that work with all media plus we are budget friendly.    when you select us as your small business website designer we work with you to arrive at a design that is user friendly in navigation, shows your products or services to their best advantage and is e-commerce ready. plus, every page reflects s.e.o. that identifies exactly what is on that page so a searcher will find your service or product by being directed to that exact page - not just your main page. we also provide content/advertising writing and marketing. we submit your site to google plus set up a business page, bing and their business page and get you verified. we also submit your site to other search engines and pages in your industry. "surely that will be another fee" you say.....no it is included with your one time payment of $475.00 which also includes updates for a year. you pay no monthly fees to us, you will pay for hosting with an internet company per year. below, you will see a banner link to an internet company we endorse and have used since 2011.



  

































 


hours: 10:30 - 7:30 pm monday thru sat. closed sunday - available after hours if necessary.we are online daily except sunday so your update requests are handled the same or next day. this frees you to conduct your business without trying to update your website yourself. we think this process works to your advantage in at least two ways: you will know the site will get updated asap and you will not have to depend on an employee who may or may not get your update on the site correctly or may be too busy to handle this obligation.    your business day is full of activities and you want to devote all of your day to handling as many of them as possible. so you may leave the website updates to us, handle the emails from your hosting provider, fix any problems or questions that may arise and relax ! one call or email to us and you know we will handle the issue. every website package we provide includes our friendly services. we have been in business a long time so we know the health of every small business depends on less stress. let us help keep you excited about your ownership of a small business.hosting of your website: we are affiliates and host our own site with ipower.com . their service and hosting fees are always reasonable and include lots of free website items. when you click below just pick your domain name & hosting years. the fees go up after one year so if you want to save a bundle, sign up for at least 2 or 3 years.                    we are also affiliates with ipage and recommend them. they have the same options as their sister site above but are some cheaper.    we also have been with paypal for business for a long time. we sell products on our other website and have clients that also sell products. no credit card terminal or monthly fees, just their flat fees to sell all over the world. plus they provide shipping labels - my favorite item - even if you did not receive your payment through them. your customers only see the payment page which allows them to use paypal or their own credit card - no sign-up.  have a look at our portfolio for examples of our work. lots of options available - we design mostly without templates so your website is uniquely yours!    we are here to help any way we can. let us put your small business online today.





 


we would like to thank all of our small business clients these many years.your business success depends on you. take time to relax so your decisions will be great!
