giving back





over the years i've nabbed plenty of gratis content from the interwebs. music, movies, jpgs, etc. well, throughout the years, one image has eluded me: a picture of the 3d king kong poster included in a 1975 issue of dynamite magazine (said poster hung on my bedroom wall for many years as a young lad in the mid 70's).there was not one single image of this on the web. there were lots of people mentioning it in forums, bemoaning the fact that they lost it or their parents threw it away. but there was no image - until now. i bought the issue off ebay, and luckily it still had the poster in it. sadly, the 3d glasses were missing. but i will rectify that. now, just to make sure it shows up in google searches and future generations are satisfied, here are some keywords: 3d king kong poster, dynamite magazine 1975.you're welcome.

conan





so a lot of people are yakking about this nbc / conan / leno imbroglio, and no matter which side of the issue you care about (for instance, leno stinks and is only for the aged or sweetly retarded), it has been undeniably fascinating to watch conan's show over the last couple weeks. i can't think of any instance where someone is about to be terminated and yet has such a public forum to vent before even being dismissed. basically, they told the guy he was going to be done on a certain date, then left him with a plugged-in mic, a camera, and budget. since then he has dedicated almost every moment to attacking the network that (for now) signs his paycheck. almost every joke concerns nbc's ineptitude, the band plays nothing but the most expensive-to-license songs (zeppelin, stones, springsteen), comedy bits are conceived and aired based solely on how expensive they can be (like last night's $1.5 million bugati mouse prop) and even the guests gang up on the network. i'm enjoying it, to say the least.

mandom!





what is mandom? mandom is power. mandom is desire. mandom is all. it's like the spice from "dune."mandom was a cologne from japan in the 70's created by the mandom corporation, formerly known as the tancho corporation. according to the always-reliable and never wrong wikipedia, the mandom corporation also has it's fingers in many other fascinating pies such as "life and nonlife insurance; staffing; and general services, such as building maintenance and operation, back-office, and environmental maintenance." well, diversity is key to survival these days.and in a stroke of genius, they hired a pre-"death wish" charles bronson to star in a series of commercials for the manly scent in the early 70's. these commercials are, quite simply, art in it's purest form. cozy vignettes of culture and erudite ease are interspersed with pistols - always a winning technique.as you can see in the commercials, the key to mandom is coat your entire torso with it, almost as if showering. you must also spin the cap off, then toss it away as if you are far too important and powerful to be concerning with things like misplaced cologne caps. now you are living life the mandom way.later in the 70's the mandom corporation unleashed a line of high-end men's products called "gatsby." awesome. i don't think bronson was the face of this line, which is probably a good thing. a brand called gatsby requires a celebrity that's perceived as being a tad more - well, there's no nice way to put this - drunken. someone like peter o' toole or oliver reed. thanks to the mysterious and powerful ouzo / comic-book importer known as the drivas for the heads up.

here comes the foreman





here's a neat little video that shows a male silverback gorilla walking upright, just like us people do. this is no lazy amble either - our gorilla friend is in quite the hurry, it appears.after viewing this it should be pretty easy for all of you non-believers to simply imagine an eight or nine-foot version of this striding around in the pacific northwest, yes? we are all ambulatory, hair-covered cousins on this big blue marble.

conan, thinking





or maybe he's brooding - hard to tell. he's frequently described as sullen-eyed, so it could very well be the latter. whichever it is, you'd best move along. muscles coiled like a panthers could spring into action at any moment, with your beheading being the most likely result.artwork by the legendary big john buscema

awesome





the coolness of the above image shatters every conceivable scale that mankind could possibly have in place to measure it, i'm sure you'll agree. but what is it? well, i'll tell you.the image is from a japanese movie magazine circa 1975 or early 1976. it's an artist's conception of what the supposedly functional 40-ft robot gorilla dino de laurentiis was constructing for his il-fated 1976 remake of "king kong" might look like. eagle-eyed viewers will note that there are no pneumatics or wiring within, just a metal skeleton (much like homer simpson's failed robot), but these are minor scientific quibbles.reminds me of the incredible cutaway illustrations of kaiju from a japanese book called "an anatomical guide to monsters" published in the 60's. i would pay a king's ransom for this book, but after searching for it pretty consistently since i become aware of it's existence some years ago, i fear i shall never hold it in my hands. one could say with little exaggeration that it is my white whale. i keep hoping someone will reprint it. but at least i have jpgs of some of the pages, and now, thanks to the magic of click and drag, so do you.

how to photo direct promotional materials for an upcoming film





"ok guys, we're almost done. now jack...for this next set, you think you could arch an eyebrow? you know - to let audiences know that  you're the 'wacky one.' wouldn't want people to think you're playing against type or anything. that's perfect....michael, you just keep looking slightly unsure like you always do in everything you've ever done. great..."

let's talk "hooper," shall we?





the next time you are wandering around target, you may notice an end-cap of discounted dvd titles for $5. most of these titles are dreck and are unworthy of even that small tariff. however, if the stars align for you as they did for me, you may find a gem amongst the dross. i am of course referring to “hooper,” the 1978 burt reynolds vehicle concerning the life of sonny hooper, an aging hollywood stuntman.this virtues of this movie are legion. rather than go into some lengthy examination, i will list them in bullet-point form so as to aid in their digestion. so, here are the things that make “hooper” awesome and well worth your hard-earned $5:*the movie poster, which they were wise enough to use as the dvd cover, has an illustration of burt blowing a bubble with some gum while wearing a big cowboy hat (see above).*the movie is not only about stuntmen, but was directed by a stuntman (hal needham, the auteur also responsible for “cannonball run” and “megaforce.”)*it has adam west with a moustache (he is the “star” burt is stunting for during the filming of “the spy who laughed at danger.”).*there is a scene wherein a horse drinks a can of beer. burt then kisses said horse.*burt has trained his beer-drinking horse to crap on command, and he urges it to do so in the car of someone he is at odds with. this was big in 1978 cinema, as clyde the orangutan in clint eastwood’s philo beddoe epics “every which way but loose” and “any which way you can” had a penchant for crapping in vehicles as well.*there is a lengthy scene ( a ‘set piece’, as they call it in the biz) where everyone heads to a bar and drives along a highway drinking copious amounts of beer in broad daylight, heedless of their own safety or that of others. one even drives backwards at high speeds while drinking. when a highway patrolman on a motorcycle simply attempts to do his job and enforce the law, they attach a cable to his bike and then to a pole, which sends him sprawling. they escape punishment for this act as well.*the stuntmen engage in a barroom brawl with a gang of large rednecks led by terry bradshaw, completely destroying their friend’s bar in the process.*the rednecks are then befriended, as is moviedom’s custom,  and everyone repairs to burt’s ranch where, after a long night of partying, burt is the lone man standing. as the other revelers slumber around him, he watches a home movie reel of his prior stunts. in a meta-scene of epic proportions, the home movie contains footage of burt tackling the rapids in a canoe from “deliverance.”*most of the stunts featured in the movie within the movie make no sense at all, no matter what the context. in one, burt escapes from some villains chasing him by getting into a helicopter. the helicopter then goes straight up into the air and hovers, at which point burt leaps out the helicopter and falls.  as hooper, he falls onto an airbag and sets the world record for the longest free fall drop. bully for hooper - but how does this makes any sense in a movie about a spy? the character would simply be splattered on the pavement. they repeat this nonsense in a scene where burt rescues a dog (?) and attempts to flee between rooftops via a tracked cable of some sort. he makes it halfway across, then falls when the cable snaps. again, this makes no sense for a lead character in a spy film.*brian keith and jan-michael vincent co-star as fellow stuntmen. brian keith is jocko, the old retired stuntman, and jan-michael is the young upstart (they call him “the kid”) looking to seize burt’s crown.*the movie was the inspiration for the lee major’s television series “the fall guy,” for which it deserves our eternal gratitude.*the big stunt during the finale involves burt and jan-michael driving a car around some type of industrial village that is being blown to smithereens, and when the bridge over a ravine collapses, they have to jump it in a custom-made rocket car, thus setting another stunt man record for longest jump. sonny celebrates this by punching the film within a film’s director in the face before heading off to presumably drink more canned beer.*naturally, the movie has a blooper reel playing over the end credits. they take this up a notch by having a banjo-fueled song called "nothin' like the life (of a hollywood stuntman) playing as well.there you go – although i’m certain i left out many laudable moments. i didn’t even scratch the surface of sonny hooper’s painkiller addiction, the possibility of his paralysis, and sally field bouncing around in tight t-shirts. in short, i wholeheartedly encourage you to run, don’t walk, and get your $5 copy of “hooper” now.

pointless, unexplainable desires





i just opened a business and in the process cut my pay by about 70% from what i was previously making in the ad biz. we have another baby on the way and the insurance at my wife’s new-ish job blows, meaning that after the baby arrives the stork will also be dropping off a co-pay bill for about $5k, not to mention the increased daycare costs three months after her maternity leave ends. and our house needs a new roof in a bad way.and yet, for some inexplicable reason, about once a month i find myself logging onto ebay and looking at auctions for the large-scale shogun warriors godzilla figure released in the 70’s.why? i’m not entirely sure. let’s peel back the layers of my cerebellum and try and find out together, shall we? a good start might be to get all of you who are not familiar with said godzilla toy up to speed on this item. here’s a visual to get the saliva flowing.very cool, yes? here’s some background for you: this toy was released by mattel in 1979 as part of their ‘shogun warriors” line of giant robot figures based on japanese characters. the godzilla figure stood 19 1/2” tall and as you can see, didn’t really look all that much like godzilla.  but its scale was impressive for the time.i know what you’re thinking – “just another gen-x’er wanting to reclaim the toy his parents threw away.” not so - i never owned this toy. when it was released i was 12 years old, and had outgrown toys. but i still liked godzilla as a character / concept, so i always looked at it whenever i was stuck at sears or jc penny’s with my mom and headed to the toy section out of boredom. here’s more pics.his “atomic breath” was simulated via a flicking plastic tongue (triggered by a lever that is prone to break) and his fist also shot off, which didn’t make a helluva lot of sense either. and his feet had wheels on the bottom, but if you rolled him too fast he simply fell over. and yet, despite these many shortcomings…i want one. the overall effect of it is undeniably neat. we now pause for a word from our sponsors.it’s not like i don’t have godzilla figures already. i have the re-issue of the old beloved aurora model from the 60’s / 70's that i built as a kid, as well as some nice inexpensive vinyl figures from japan that actually look like the character. why does this imperfect, altogether unnecessary thing keep flitting about, moth-like, in and out of my consciousness?cue my wife's reply - "because you're stupid." well, that may be true, but there must be some deeper, darker force at work. i also must clarify that i never bid much on this item when i do try and nab it - generally i go for imperfect specimens (paint scuffs, loose firing hand, the aforementioned broken tongue lever) and bid a maximum of $50. over the last eight years or so i have probably tried to get it on the cheap somewhere in the realm of ten times, and am always defeated.then again, father's day is fast approaching...it's not too much to ask for a little green plastic love on june 21st, is it?

the sweetness





an old friend of mine recently unearthed this and posted it on his facebook page - it's a segment from steve martin's 1981 nbc special "comedy is not pretty." this has been stuck in my head since viewing it way back then, but whenever i mentionedit  to people they didn't know what i was talking about. now am thrilled - nay, honored - to be able to present it to you, my loyal readers.el paso - marty robbins steve martin

i'm "with it"





i just revived my twitter account after opening one last summer and promptly forgetting about it. why? because i do everything ashton, oprah and ceo's of large multi-national corporations do.if so inclined you can follow my whip-smart observations there, under the name blogfoot of course. most of the time it will simply link you back to new posts here, but hey - you'll be way ahead of those hayseeds who simply have the site bookmarked. what a bunch of cavemen!

best opening line of a book ever?





"it was a bright cold day in april, and the clocks were striking thirteen."-george orwell1984that's got my vote. there's certainly no shortage of great openings of famous and feted books (fear & loathing in las vegas, a christmas carol, slaughterhouse five, something wicked this way comes, etc), but orwell's opening is impressivley simple, using just one word ("thirteen") to immediately communicate that there is something different about the world he is bringing the reader into.discuss amongst yourselves. or not. watch someone get cock-punched by a kangaroo on youtube  if that's what you feel like doing. this is america, after all.

the unbelievable & horrifying truth





after toiling in the trenches for years at various advertising agencies, i recently opened up my own business - a barbershop. so far things are going well - everyday we are servicing more customers than the day before, people are leaving happy, those coming in say that their friends told them about it, etc. fairly gratifying thus far.and as someone who worked in advertising for 13 years, and always did so at agencies that believed that smart, challenging brand communications that blazed trails in heretofore un-plowed media terrain were ultimately the only way to build your business, i have some news to report.it's bullshit.now, i'll admit we've only been open for 10 days, and we have a long road to trod yet. i also admit that we are going to do some advertising sooner rather than later. but what i have discovered so far is a couple of things that will horrify all you practitioners of craft who stay at the office late in thrall of your bosses, tirelessly digging for that pure, original message that some client can ruin by slapping an exclamation point on. those couple things i've discovered are this:1.) the best advertising is positive word of mouth.2.) direct mail works.there it is. i leave you now to writhe in agony and question your place in the grand scheme of things.
