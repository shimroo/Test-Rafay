the glorious church -
													what is the future of the church? can we know? 
													can we visualize it? the answer is a 
													resounding "yes!" and the reason we can say 
													this is because the bible describes the 
													church jesus will present to himself as a 
													"glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle 
													or any such thing..." (ephesians 5:27). this 
													is our divinely determined future, settled 
													by god and unconditionally destined to come 
													to pass. but what does the bible mean by the 
													term "glorious church?" how do we define it? 
													how do we describe it? how do we really know 
													if we are approaching it in our own 
													experience within the body of christ? the 
													authors of the glorious church attempt to 
													answer these questions, and more, by means 
													of a "contemporary interview" with paul, the 
													bondservant and apostle of jesus christ. 
													this engaging literary device will challenge 
													the reader to search out for himself god's 
													plan for his end-time church as revealed in 
													the scriptures.
