protecting & restoring the rivers & fisheries of idaho since 1990.




    explore our work
  














idaho is home to 107,651 miles of river, and idaho rivers united is the only conservation organization in our state focused exclusively on the health and protections of our incredible river resources. in addition to stressors such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, poorly managed and inefficient water systems, water quality, and declining aquifers, idaho’s fast-growing population and increased demand for multi-use landscapes and natural resources is amplifying stressors on our rivers. we’re keeping idaho's rivers healthy and flourishing for generations to come. if you love a river, join iru today.

what we do










protect & restore rivers

our rivers are one of idaho’s most cherished assets and should remain protected, healthy, and wild. we work to increase river protections throughout the state through increasing idaho’s wild & scenic river designations, water policy, education, and advocacy.

wild fish protection & recovery

for over three decades, iru has been the leading voice for idaho’s wild fish, with most of our efforts focused on our declining salmon and steelhead. we work to protect and recover idaho’s wild fish through advocacy, policy work, engaging with our leaders, community education, and partnerships. see current fish returns here.

mining reform 

iru is committed to mining reform and minimizing the negative impacts of irresponsible mining from the headwaters to the mouth of idaho’s rivers. we will continue to monitor, provide comment, and object, as necessary, to proposed mining operations within idaho.

ensure clean water access

we’re committed to protecting the health of our waterways state-wide. clean water is vital to the health and vitality of our communities and ecosystems. we work to improve the health of our rivers through urban river initiatives, minimizing the impacts of development on rivers, and community engagement. we also do this through hydropower reform work.

hydropower reform

idaho rivers united plays a central role in the hydropower reform coalition, an organization that protects, enhances, and restores america’s rivers, watersheds, and communities affected by hydropower operations. the coalition is comprised of 160 conservation organizations throughout the united states, and engages in policy, standards, licensing, and projects surrounding hydropower issues.

river stewardship & advocacy

idaho rivers united has grown into a statewide organization, yet our roots are in grassroots advocacy. we understand the power of your voice. whether the rivers you love are in your backyard or are your favorite place to play, you can have a say in how they are managed and protected. speaking up for our waterways, rivers, and wild fish makes a difference. your voice can influence policy, waterway protections, and elected officials.

idaho rivers united recognizes the traditional lands of the first nations and first peoples who have been stewards of the land and waterways in which we work for thousands of years. we value and prioritize the opportunities to partner with them and are honored to work alongside those who have protected and preserved these landscapes for time immemorial. these opportunities call us to commit to continuously learning how to be better stewards of the lands in which we work.the following tribes have been active participants in our campaigns and programming. our organization encourages our partners to learn more about conservation efforts being led by these and other tribes in idaho: nimiipuu (nez perce), shoshone-bannock, salish kootenai, kootenai tribe of idaho and the shoshone-paiute. to read more about why we prioritize tribal justice in our work, go to our tribal partnership page.
