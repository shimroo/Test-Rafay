alumnus kevin dresser `90 inspires students with art and design #sksexperience kevin dresser, class of 1990, is a graphic artist and the founder of dresser johnson in new paltz, new york– a creative studio where he blends his passion for art and design. known for his generosity, kevin regularly returns to the storm king school to share his expertise and inspire students. most recently, he led a calligraphy workshop for art classes, providing students with supplies and letting them keep the pens they used. the lesson was further enriched by demonstrations of arabic and chinese calligraphy by sks junior faisal s. `26 and others.kevin’s journey to becoming a successful graphic artist wasn’t conventional. he started at sks with plans to study engineering at stevens institute of technology, inspired by sculptor alexander calder. but after one year at stevens, kevin realized that art is his true passion. a chance encounter with a security guard outside the pratt institute led to his admission to the school, where he began his formal training in graphic design.kevin’s career took off when he became art director at flatiron news magazine, with his work later featured in the art directors club’s “young guns” exhibition. he then spent three years apprenticing under renowned typographer jonathan hoefler. today, kevin is known for his distinctive lettering, often responding to inquiries about his work with, “it’s not a font, it’s lettering.”along with his design work, kevin is passionate about animal rights. through his studio, dresser johnson, he has worked on major projects, including the band-aid logo and signage for landmarks like the museum of modern art and radio city music hall. kevin also created brooklynbunny.com, the longest-running interactive rabbit webcam, which raised awareness for animal welfare causes.in addition to his calligraphy workshop, kevin continues to support storm king, having spoken most recently at career night in march 2024. his story of following his creative instincts and pursuing his passion for art resonates deeply with our students. many thanks go to kevin for his ongoing inspiration and commitment to sks!

students tackle climate law at vassar’s legal hackathon #sksexperiencerecently, five students from the storm king school participated in a dynamic, legal-focused hackathon at vassar college, organized by political science professor arpitha kodiveri. the students were joined by sks faculty member courtney sutter, who teaches introduction to law and global studies history, and head of school lisa shambaugh.storm king’s students were assigned to four teams, collaborating with peers from nearby high schools to tackle one of two pressing legal scenarios. they were supported by vassar students and climate lawyers before presenting their solutions to the group.the first scenario focused on the urgent issue of climate migration, specifically how the law can protect climate refugees, particularly those from small island nations. the second scenario challenged students to strategize how a national government could take legal action against fossil fuel companies for their role in climate migration.one team, led by antonio m. ’26, earned special recognition for their innovative proposal using antitrust laws to litigate against fossil fuel companies. following the event, the students expressed their gratitude for the experience and their interest in potentially applying to vassar college.reflecting on the experience, ms. shambaugh noted, “it was powerful to see our students in the same space where our board of trustees recently met to shape the school’s future. it was a moment to reflect on the present, past, and future of storm king.” during the event, lisa also gave the students a tour of the vassar campus, sharing personal anecdotes from her own time there as a student. “we’re lucky to have so many nearby colleges and universities, and as a vassar alum, i’m excited to explore opportunities for future connection and partnership,” she added.
