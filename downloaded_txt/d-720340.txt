   what our customers are saying about us     
  
"thanks so much to robert from clarke kent plumbing for clearing out a main stoppage clog in my old 1950's house.   i was so impressed by his professionalism, knowledge, and helpfulness.  robert came out on 3 different occasions (within an 18 hour time period- on a weekend, i might add) to help me unclog my main sewage line.  he walked me through the different options, problem solved, and kept prices to a minimum.  he also didn't mind me being by his side so that i could understand the process.  robert worked very efficiently, communicated with me through the entire process, and came at the time he said he would.  i would recommend clarke kent plumbing to all of my friends and plan on using them to replace my main sewage line in the next year or so."-colleen j.

 ​"mr. mckillip was very personable and the price he quoted me, was the price i ended up paying. i can honestly say, i can't remember the last time i've been this happy to pay for a service. mr. mckillip went above and beyond what was required of him, and exceeded all of my expectations. i am impressed by both mr. mckillip and your company. your customer service reps/dispatchers were also very kind, on point, and professional. without a doubt, if i ever need the services of a plumber in the future, i will be calling clarke kent plumbing! trust me, i will be sure to recommend your company to everyone i know. great plumbers are hard to find!"-a. opel
