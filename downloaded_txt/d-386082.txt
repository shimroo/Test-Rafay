adb helps china build less-accidents-prone expressway





the asian development bank  on friday said it is assisting the construction of an expressway in south china that incorporates, for the first time of adb's china projects, traffic safety strategy aimed at reducing road accidents.     the 64-kilometer expressway between wuding county and kunming city in yunnan province is expected to take four years to complete and cost around 745 million u.s. dollars. adb will provide a 200-million-u.s.-dollar loan, while yunnan provincial government, the ministry of communications, and domestic banks will furnish the rest of the funding.     the project will supplement other transport corridors built linking china with its neighbors in the greater mekong sub-region to boost trade, tourism and regional integration.     adb said a key element of the project will be a program that aims to build in low-cost, efficient counter-measures and develop strategies to reduce the number of accidents.     this is the first time a specific program addressing local road safety issues has been included in an adb road loan to the country, the multilateral lender said.  source: xinhua

commentary: davos meeting links china closer with outside world





china, which has just successfully hosted a world sporting carnival -- the 2008 olympics and paralympics -- in beijing, is now ready to embrace a global economic gala, the summer davos meeting, in the adjacent metropolis of tianjin.     with the opening on saturday of the two-day economic forum, which has drawn some 1,400 participants from nearly 90 countries and regions, china will once again be in the spotlight on the global stage.     as an active participant in the globalization process, china is entering a new era of integration into the world economy, bolstered by its growing political influence, scientific development and social progress.     the year 2008 marks the 30th anniversary of china's reform and opening up drive, as well as the 30th anniversary of the country's debut at the davos forum.     this is not just a happy coincidence, but something of historical necessity.     ever since the beginning of its reform and opening up, china has been invited to send delegations to take part in the annual meetings of the world economic forum. this has provided a perfect platform for the nation to communicate with and learn from the rest of the world.     thanks to the three decades of reform and opening up, and with the help of capital and expertise from the outside world, china has gradually transformed from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented one, and upgraded itself from a low-income nation to a medium-income one.     the past 30 years also witnessed china become increasingly open and closely connected to the rest of the world. the hosting of the tianjin summer davos will further help the country to integrate into the global economy, and the chinese enterprises to sharpen their competitive edge and gain greater access to the international market.     over the past 30 years, the chinese people have changed their way to look at the outside world, and the world has also taken a new perspective to observe china.     the "china miracle" is a decisive factor behind the fact that the country is playing host to more and more important international events in recent years. while contributing significantly to the world development, china has also explored a new mode of growth, which underscores a scientific, peaceful and harmonious development. the country, together with other emerging economies, will play an increasingly important role in the globalization process.     the tianjin summer davos forum will help pool new ideas on future actions against challenges faced by china and the world at large, such as global warming, environmental deterioration, resource depletion and financial instability.     as a responsible member of the international community, china will continue to share opportunities and cope with challenges in tandem with other economies. and just as premier wen jiabao vowed on wednesday at the 63rd un general assembly, china will continue its reform and opening-up policy, to achieve its goal of modernization and build itself into a strong, prosperous, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious country.source: xinhua
