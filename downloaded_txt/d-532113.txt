welcome
                  to ptfnasty.com



this
            collection of material was compiled on a personal quest to uncover
            any and all possible information about the ptf. 
            i was fascinated with the sounds of power from the twin 3100hp
            napier deltic engines and speed that these 80' wooden patrol boats 
					displayed as they operated from da nang harbor. 
            now 35 years later, with the technology of the internet and e-mail, i have been 
able to compile this web page to honor the men who served and the boats that 
brought them down the coastal waterways of vietnam.

				regard to the ptf-17, you may know she has been in the custody

				the fiscal restraints of a non-profit organization, over the 
				past 10-15 years she hasn't received the care that is required 
				of an open helm/wooden vessel, and she's in pretty rough shape.  
				our volunteer efforts began last year, with an objective to 
				simply execute an external preservation of the boat.  our 
				goal is to . . . more here
