disclaimer 
do not attempt any techniques or methods illustrated/described in this book. they can result in serious injury or death to an untrained user. the purpose of this book is to give people an idea of the authentic art of ninjutsu and the art of ancient japan, which is taught by grandmaster law. all pictures included in this volume take parts from other different techniques to show their effectiveness and practicality. each technique is not demonstrated in full to eliminate people from mimicking and injuring themselves or others. also giving away too much of the art will leave nothing left for people to explorer and discover. this is the real art of the ninja (unlike other schools that claim to teach real ninjutsu) and not a bunch of different this art is composed of eighteen levels. each pupil must complete 9 sessions (35 techniques multiplied by each session) before attempting their first level. as each level is reached, the number of techniques (315 techniques in each level) increases with every level (315 multiplied by each numbered level) to reach a total of 5,620 techniques by the eighteenth level or mastery. this is not accurate as the number of techniques by master level far exceeds the total 5,620 and is endless. this art and these techniques should only be practiced/performed under a skilled and well trained master who can properly explain (purpose and effects), teach and understands the human body/anatomy. without the proper frame of mind and discipline, continuous exposure to fighting techniques can lead to ruin, instead of self development. thank you for your interest and we hope that you enjoy discovering more about this misunderstood and fascinating art dated back to ancient times. once more, we hope to leave people with a better understanding of this captivating art and all of its benefits on a person's everyday life.

---------------------
new thank you letter from west coast's black star brewing company - for geijin ryu's accomplished work in our part of a film commercial.

there are no doubt people who think that even to be practicing material arts will not prove useful when a real need arises. as far as that is concerned; the true way of martial arts is to practice in such a way that they will be useful at any time, and to teach them in such a way that they will be useful in all things. 
-grandmaster robert law 


 ".... a few things you taught me with in that small dojo at the corner of weston road and wilson on the green straw mats saved my life on several occasions. for that i will always be great full and respectful of you. further more it was what you taught me that i past on to my own daughter that saved her from a brutal rapist roughly four years back. in a sense i credit you completely for her ability to defend herself from that attacker.
