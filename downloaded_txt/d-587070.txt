lower school parent testimonial
"great community. incredible atmosphere and faculty. as a mom with young kids, i feel relieved that i can drop them off at school and everything from swim lessons to after school sports and arts are all taken care of. when i pick them up after a busy day, we go home and talk about all the amazing things that happened right on campus. everyone is so friendly and helpful. we really love this place!"













grade 7 parent testimonial
"our son is loving his middle school experience. the ib program is not only helping him grow his academic skills and content knowledge, but it’s profoundly informing how he thinks about who he is in the world. he’s never been happier academically. and then there are the after-school arts! the breadth of offerings is stunning for a school of this size. he has been involved in music production, theatre tech, improv comedy, textiles, and right now he’s preparing to act in the upcoming mainstage theatre production. aws has been the perfect choice for our son. we love it.”













alumni testimonial
"during my time at aws, i was able to grow and understand more about myself, from what i wanted to study to the type of person i wanted to be. now, i'm looking forward to applying that knowledge as i transition into adulthood."













parent testimonial
"annie wright has offered a 'total' experience in education for my children. as early learners - and very different kinds of learners - both developed strong math and literacy foundations while being nurtured to play and socialize in caring ways by a caring team of adults. the pyp program readies students to think critically; to be curious and make connections through all that they learn about."













grade 9 parent testimonial
"our son's experience has been nothing short of stellar. the academic program is rigorous and accessible, and his teachers genuinely care about helping him do his best. he’s thriving! outside of the classroom, the school’s opportunities are incredible. our son is involved in a (s)elective and plays multiple sports. everywhere we look, he is surrounded by passionate classmates, teammates, and coaches. this aws community is like nothing we’ve ever experienced before, and we couldn’t be happier that we chose aws for our son’s high school experience."
