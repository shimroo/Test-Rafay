psr-la achieves results for environmental justice



ban all oil drilling in los angeles















after more than a decade of grassroots organizing across la with the stand coalition, our call for #nodrillingwherewereliving pushed the city and the county of los angeles to end the environmental racism of urban oil drilling in black and brown communities. 



prevent neighborhood oil drilling across california















psr-la is proud to have stood with community partners to pass sb 1137 banning new oil drilling near sensitive sites like schools, homes, and hospitals. we will continue to educate californians about the dangers of drilling, and build our movement for climate justice.



develop california’s first neighborhood-based just transition plan















working together with small businesses and residents, psr-la has developed a plan to convert dirty dry cleaners to clean chemicals, and protect our air while uplifting our local economy in south los angeles. 



win support for nuclear abolition















psr-la spearheaded efforts that prompted the city of los angeles and the state of california to adopt resolutions advocating for worldwide nuclear disarmament. our leadership has inspired similar actions across the u.s. together with local communities and elected officials in southern california and beyond, psr-la is building power and political will to abolish nuclear weapons for a safer, more just world.
