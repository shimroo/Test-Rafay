mdm radioarchived content 2001 -2011

for a good number of years and with several website makeovers, this was the mdmradio.com web site!

the new owners of the site are not selling new and used radios and parts. instead, using archived content from 2001 -2011, the new owners want to pay tribute to the dedication of ted bleiman and mdm radio. what would we have done without your stock of old radio ephemera including manuals, literature, schematics, technical sheets, books, magazines (old), and catalogs.


 
new web design 2011

welcome to the new mdmradio.com web site!
thank you for finding us. i hope you enjoy browsing through my pages. here you will find a wide assortment of new and used radios and parts, including nos (new old stock), components, 2 way equipment and accessories, hardware and supplies and more. you just never know what i'll have in my inventory! remember our motto - or is it our slogan...anyhow remember..."if it's in stock...we've got it!"
special offer: free bonus october to december while supply lasts - beautiful music with $25 or higher purchase - vivaldi's four seasons on cd - a little change from the rock and roll or country you are used to listening to while driving. and its free with your purchase.
regarding purchases on this site: while we are working the bugs out, if there is something you want to purchase, please communicate with us as soon as possible. we will then quote you the shipping charges and payment can be made thru paypal. paypal will accept your credit card purchases. payment can also be made with a money order made payable to:
ted bleiman
p.o. box 31353
chicago, il 60631-0353
once we get the bugs out, the payment system will be much easier on line.
thanks for your patronage.
i always stock all kinds of old radio ephemera including manuals, literature, schematics, technical sheets, books, magazines (old), and catalogs. i might just have paperwork covering your older radio equipment!
some of the old vintage radio parts i stock include vacuum tubes, capacitors, old radio knobs, antique radio chassis, meters, semiconductors, dials and controls. from time to time i also carry test equipment, rectifiers, and diodes. some of the old radio brand names include manufacturers such as motorola, general electric (aka harris, macom, ericksson, kenwood, e f johnson, uniden, standard-vertex, rca, radius, and others. i also sell complete radio units in working order including shortwave and amateur equipment and accessories.
mdmradio started in 1990, however, we were forced to abandon our brick and mortar operation in november 2006. we maintained a web presence until misfortune caused our website to be shut down. this new site has many more useful features and interesting reference links which we had wanted to include before and now can bring a more useful and entertaining visit.
for over 40 years i've enjoyed buying, selling and trading radios and parts. it's been a great experience and i've made many friends along the way. as always, if you have any questions, just ask and i will respond promptly. contact me thru the website, or call 773-255-9838 or send an email to mdmradio@yahoo.com
you can see what i currently have in inventory by clicking on the category links at the left. my main categories are broken down into the following areas: portables, mobiles, base stations, repeaters, parts & components, test equipment, reeds & filters, manuals, books, special receivers and scanners, audi-video, and miscellaneous.
i am associated with several collector's organizations and someone is always looking for something. if you can't find what you are looking for, please contact me through email or via phone and let me know. chances are, i might have it, but haven't listed it yet. for your convenience and online safety, everything can be purchased through my secure shopping cart. please review my terms and conditions regarding payment and shipping options.
any amateur passing thru the chicago area can find me on cfmc vhf 146.16/146.76 (1b) or 448.75/443.75 (2a) almost daily. we'd be happy to hear from you.
thank you,
ted bleiman k9mdm - head trouble maker

the management?

has to be told: mdm has a lot of very enthusiastic fans who have been with us for many, many years. some are more than customers. tom mortirelli takes it upon himself to write us into his blog. we once received a huge shipment of antique parts and tube radios. the sender was peter moss, self acknowledged radio hoarder, who needed to clean out space for his office. he was an expert in janitorial supplies and the chemical raw materials involved in that industry, which happens to have an inordinate number of radio heads. so the guys involved in manufacturing cleaning products like dish soap and laundry detergents were probably mdm fans. and peter worked for a company that benefited from his expertise in both areas.

comment from the wayback machine: junior rivera : i was this site's biggest fan when i was a teen. loved the technology, built radios, radar detectors, spying devices - you name it. i suspect that some of the rumors about the closing of ibg systems are bogus, but they still made the news as if they were true. really annoying that the management has to hire a removal service to clean up the search because of some bogus story being passed around on social media. the search for the corporate name started showing an association with a shoplifting arrest for the wife of the cfo which was not even true. the search removal firm imfy.us is consulting on managing the search problem. they specialize in pushing down negative search results that appear in google searches. that a search removal business even exists is a sign of the times we live in. sometimes i wish we could go back to when radios were high tech.
