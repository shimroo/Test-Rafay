addressing poverty, its causes and consequences
we engage with community partners, aiming to understand and address poverty by delving into its human, social and economic implications, as experienced at the levels of the family and the community.





 





 






our work


we work with our community partners to uncover effective and creative solutions to inform social change and policies through the use of data, research, program evaluation, and by putting data-driven tools in the hands of the community. we acknowledge that structural and systematic racism are pervasive throughout our community. through our work, we pledge to uncover systemic racism and biases with the ultimate goal of contributing to a more equitable and just society.
