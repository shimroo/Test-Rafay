trophies and medals - london's online trophy store

welcome to trophiesandmedals.com - you have found one of the earliest online retail websites that is still trading ... we started business as an online company in 1999. we have always had our trophy home based close to london. the trophy business started in the garden shed and the first paid employee was my father-in-law which took him out of working the markets. i'm proudest of that above all else.
read more about the story at about us and in the meantime please feel free to call us if there is any trophy you want that you can't quite find as we have 1000's more available offline.

largest range of trophies, medals and awards
 trophiesandmedals.com has one of the widest selection of trophies and awards available to purchase online 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week with over 3500 products. we off this wide range from multiple suppliers because we think choice is one of the most important things we can give you. in addition we do everything in house so we can offer fast engraving and free delivery on most orders.

trophy news & trophy fun:

a school in kent emailed at 4am and rang at 8am as they desparately needed a host of rugby trophies for their rugby tournament the next day on saturday! an rfu decision on 'no winners' meant trophies had not been ordered but the school decided at the last minute that they should present some awards, quite rightly too! trophiesandmedals.com came to the rescue and organised rugby medals, ribbons, glass rugby awards and resin rugby trophies along with engraving, which we do in house, and these were sent on a saturday am service ... this is the sort of last minute trophy rescue we do all the time ... it's almost never too late!
