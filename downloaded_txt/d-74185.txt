  meet
beth daly

hello, i’m so happy to “meet you”. thank you for taking a few moments to visit.  i have been a resident of fort lauderdale since the late 1970's.  i am originally from a small and friendly community in south western pennsylvania; oakmont just outside of pittsburgh.  i love sports and i am a still a huge steelers & penguins fan!  along with my wonderful family, i enjoy our beautiful blue skies, fresh air, sandy beaches, exceptional weather, and friendly people from all corners of the globe.

														
over the years, i have had the opportunity to enjoy and build wonderful relationships & friendships with my customers. "my business, and my customers are an integral part of my life.  i listen to them, care about them, and they trust me.  we work together as a team and together we achieve their goals."

														
working with the "treat others as you would like to be treated" attitude, i constantly strive to exceed my customer’s expectations.  attending showings, appraisals, inspections, all meetings, and all closings, i need to have my hands in and on the transaction. i want to know what is going on each and every step of the way, and i like to keep my customers informed as well.
