about us.
studio 4 east was the creation of the brothers wintermantel (mikel, dan and pete) and came to life in their grandparent’s basement at 4 east main street in allegany, ny. they eventually moved to the current location at 103 west main where they expanded their empire and plotted to take over the world one t-shirt at a time.the brothers wintermantel sat atop their empire for 40 years until they decided that it was time to pass the torch to the next generation of imperialist t-shirt artists. after an exhaustive search to find the perfect heirs, a decision was made.january 15, 2021 . . . a cold western new york friday . . . a coronation took place where the heirs to the empire were declared. well, that may not be exactly what happened but it sounds a lot better than we met with lawyers in jamestown to sign the paperwork . . . either way, studio 4 east changed hands and started a new adventure.under new ownership, studio 4 east still offers the same great experience that people have come to expect. we are the area’s premier custom apparel supplier and our artwork is the second to none!
