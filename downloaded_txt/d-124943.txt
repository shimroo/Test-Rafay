doggie daycare
our daycare facility operates under the same standard of care that you have come to expect at the east greenbush animal hospital. our facility offers several large play areas on rubber flooring for dogs to have supervised play in well matched groups. each play area has solid structure play equipment to promote physical exercise, mental stimulation and social interaction. as you can imagine playing all day can be too much for most dogs, so we have a separate room where dogs can have “nap time” as well as lunch or snack time for younger dogs and puppies.
because we want to provide a quality experience for all the puppies and dogs that attend daycare, we are requiring a temperament evaluation conducted by trained dog handlers prior to accepting their application. we will also have questionnaires for pet parents to fill out to provide information to help evaluate your dog’s social preference and likelihood of benefiting from a group play environment.
