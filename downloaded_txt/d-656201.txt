embroidery & chenille

from concept to product, lahaie's is your embroidery and chenille expert. we digitize designs in-house and work directly with you during the process to ensure the highest quality and satisfaction.
we can embroider your logo on a uniform for your business, produce a chenille full-back patch for your auto or motorcycle club, or anything in between! contact us today to get started or come by our shop to see (and touch) some of the designs we've produced for others.
for schools, lahaie's offers a wide variety of patch designs. these are fabricated to order and can be color-matched to your school colors and jacket. patches can be added to your jacket at any time to indicate your current accomplishments.
each patch is chenilled, text can be embroidered over the patch, and then it is mounted on a second felt layer underneath. this construction yields a durable, top quality patch made to last generations. add your team number or position for a custom look.
award patches can be made to announce your personal standing in league or district play. these patches are shaped in the outline of the state and reflect state standing or rectangular form to reflect district standing. for national standings, we can use a u.s. outline. award patches are typically 4 to 5 inches wide and we can easily accomodate 4 lines of text. since these are custom made, come with your ideas and we'll try to make them a reality!








sewing & alterations

lahaie's provides sewing and alterations services for your convenience.
we can perform delicate hand sewing for small repairs and we have industrial machines for sewing heavy & layered fabrics. if you need to get some pants hemmed, a patch attached or removed, or anything else -- bring it in and we'll get it taken care of.
we specialize in sewing patches for uniforms, police & fire, scouts, and jackets.
