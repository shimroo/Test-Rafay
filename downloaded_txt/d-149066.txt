important safety information





important safety information


do not take lantus during episodes of low blood sugar or if you are allergic to insulin or any of the inactive ingredients in lantus.
do not share needles, insulin pens, or syringes with others. do not reuse needles.
before starting lantus, tell your doctor about all your medical conditions, including if you have liver or kidney problems, if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or if you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed.
change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you chose with each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pitted or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. do not use the same spot for each injection or inject where the skin is pitted, thickened, lumpy, tender, bruised, scaly, hard, scarred or damaged.
heart failure can occur if you are taking insulin together with certain medicines called tzds (thiazolidinediones), even if you have never had heart failure or other heart problems. if you already have heart failure, it may get worse while you take tzds with lantus. your treatment with tzds and lantus may need to be changed or stopped by your doctor if you have new or worsening heart failure. tell your doctor if you have any new or worsening symptoms of heart failure, including:

shortness of breath
swelling of your ankles or feet
sudden weight gain

tell your doctor about all the medications you take, including otc medicines, vitamins, and supplements, including herbal supplements.
lantus should be taken once a day at the same time every day. test your blood sugar levels while using insulin, such as lantus. do not make any changes to your dose or type of insulin without talking to your healthcare provider. any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision.
do not dilute or mix lantus with any other insulin or solution. it will not work as intended and you may lose blood sugar control, which could be serious. lantus must only be used if the solution is clear and colorless with no particles visible. always make sure you have the correct insulin before each injection.
while using lantus, do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how lantus affects you. you should not drink alcohol or use other medicines that contain alcohol.
the most common side effect of insulin, including lantus, is low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which may be serious and life threatening. it may cause harm to your heart or brain. symptoms of serious low blood sugar may include shaking, sweating, fast heartbeat, and blurred vision.
lantus may cause serious side effects that can lead to death, such as severe allergic reactions. get medical help right away if you have:

a rash over your whole body
trouble breathing
a fast heartbeat
sweating
swelling of your face, tongue, or throat
shortness of breath
