effective practice




hypnotherapy is a valuable therapy with which to release past trauma and decondition established habits. even though our personal unconscious only ever seeks to promote our well being it can often be the seat of faulty learning from our past, leading to low self esteem, under achievement and sometimes worse. often it attempts to protect us by raising our fears and anxieties to phobic levels to keep us from a particular activity or stimulus it sees as dangerous. sometimes these non-optimum patterns can lead to addictive behaviour. using hypnosis in therapy can facilitate a holistic relearning process.
