keyboard_arrow_leftkeyboard_arrow_right••••welcome to the structural engineers association of californiaseaoc's 3,500 members are leaders in the practice of structural and earthquake engineering and key participants in the development, interpretation, and implementation of building standards and codes.  our organization has served as the professional society for structural engineering in california since 1932.  we offer education to members, write and publish technical documents, shape state and local government policy, and encourage our members' professional development.  we support the growth of a new generation of structural engineers to meet the technical, economic and social demands of the built environment in california and around the world.

seaoc comprises four regional associations — central california (seaocc), northern california (seaonc), southern california (seaosc) and san diego (seaosd)— each unique but all committed to serving members and to helping communities by promoting safer structures wherever people live or work.
