fukushima radiation
taints us milk supplies at levels 300% higher than epa maximums - 4/11/ 2011
learn more: www.naturalnews.com/032048_radiation_milk.html

(naturalnews)
the us environmental protection agency (epa) continues to release new
data showing that various milk and water supply
 samples from
across the us are testing increasingly high for radioactive elements
such as iodine-131, cesium-134, and cesium-137, all of which 
are
being emitted from the ongoing fukushima daiichia nuclear fallout. as
of april 10, 2011, 23 us water supplies have tested positive for 
radioactive iodine-131 (http://opendata.socrata.com/w/4ig7-...), and
worst of all, milk
samples from at least three us locations have tested
positive for 
iodine-131 at levels exceeding epa maximum containment levels.
(see other articles about the radiation dangers and the truth about
what's happening in japan.)
