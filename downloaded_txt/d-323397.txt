mcabee travel



for travel agents with church, humanitarian, school, adoption or group customers

















welcome! 




	mcabee travel has always focused on customer service making it our number one priority. we have experienced agents waiting for your call. this means you get the information or quote you need quickly and efficiently, leaving you time to respond to your customer promptly. volume discounts are available for larger travel agencies. our service agreements with the carriers exclude us from publishing our fares online. one call is all it takes to get a quote from one of our knowledgeable agents.










humanitarian airfare




	focusing on the humanitarian airfare market, mcabee travel has been proudly serving travel agents as its core focus since 1988. we own the contracts with major carriers flying to a wide choice of worldwide destinations. hence, we can search for and find competitive quotes compared to airfares published by the airlines.

humanitarian rules




	humanitarian airfares have very different rules than published or consolidator fares. because there is a qualification requirement, we can only offer these fares to your clients who are traveling on behalf of non-profit organizations, churches, missionary organizations, adoption agencies, and most schools. they can be booked as individuals and groups.

booking engine




	our login protected humanitarian booking engine presents net fares and published fares that can be booked at any time. we will also let you know when a possible commission override is available on a published airfare (request a login). in addition, we also offer amadeus access for larger accounts.

group airfare




	mcabee travel specializes in international groups. we have experienced, dedicated group agents able to help you with your group request. our main market for groups is between 10 and 60 passengers. because all groups are priced independently, they cannot be booked through the booking engine, so please call us at 800-622-2335.
