riding in the backseat of a car, bus or train causes many people to feel nauseous. motioneaze provides quick, long-lasting prevention or relief (from symptoms that have already started) for motion sickness.

don't just take our word for itread what others have to say


“purchased this to take with on my first cruise. we did hit pretty rocky seas a couple of nights and i wasn’t a bit sick. i also used it during the day when we were driving thru some very curvy, up & down roads and my trip in the back seat didn’t give me any motion sickness.
it smells pleasant and seems to really work.”
