california dates chef ambassador 



aarti sequeira 



“hey there food lover! i’ve fallen for a lot of ingredients in my life, but none have stolen my heart like the delectable california date.these dates are a thing of beauty. luscious and succulent, they melt in your mouth in an explosion of caramel, molasses, and butterscotch, sometimes even a kiss of lemon. you can’t have just one. they’re a seductive, sensual delight. it’s little wonder that dates inspired the chinese proverb, “if heaven drops a date, open your mouth!”i’m never without my darling california dates. they’re so versatile. not only are they totally satisfying as a snack, but they also quickly perk up an otherwise snooze-worthy salad. but don’t stop there. dates play so well with a wealth of other ingredients, from savory meats to whiskey and amaretto to spices, herbs and chocolate. plus, they can be easily whipped up into a natural syrup, and used in a 1:1 ratio to replace refined sugars and artificial sweeteners.if california dates haven’t been your constant companion in the kitchen thus far, let your love affair begin now. they just might steal your heart!”love,aarti
