welcome to sunset cove resort & allen’s bay lodge & grill
the ruzek’s minnesota family resort welcome you to beautiful cass lake, minnesota which includes a chain of 8 different lakes and the mississippi & turtle rivers flowing through.
unknown to most people is the great diversity of the area. cass lake has miles of undeveloped wilderness shoreline, several large sugar sand beaches which make for great family vacation fun.
the area hosts a large variety of wildlife some of which are bald eagles, osprey, beaver, otters & deer. the cass lake fishing chain is 1st class. the spring walleye fishing is tremendous and remains consistent throughout the year. cass lake also supports healthy populations of musky, perch, largemouth bass, bluegill & crappie.
by lake or by land you will be close to excellent dining, golf, shopping, casinos and many other popular tourist attractions. sunset cove resort is located on the sw end of cass lake and faces west so we see beautiful sunsets on a regular basis. we are a first class family resort facility with our own large sugar sand beach for those warm sunny day’s. we also have an indoor pool for anytime use. here at the cove we take great pride in our resort facilities and grounds offering extremely clean lodging with the capability of serving the needs of small or large groups.
we have minnesota cabins, log duplexes, a-frame cabins with lofts and more. our lodge is air conditioned and has a relaxing atmosphere with bar, food, games and gifts. we are a year around minnesota family resort with great fishing, hunting and snowmobiling in our backyard. once you try sunset cove resort on beautiful cass lake you won’t need to search anymore for the best family resort in the chippewa national forest area.
