why do you see ice in your ac unit?



during the hot summer months, one of the best things you can have in your home is a properly working ac unit. it can make your home comfortable even during the hottest days.  

however, what if your ac unit isn’t keeping you as cool as it should be? what should you do? first, you probably want to examine the thermostat and see if it’s working properly. next, you want to examine the actual unit.  
what if you see an accumulation of ice in your ac unit? is it normal? should you contact a professional hvac company in englewood? let’s find out! 
is it normal? 
since the job of your ac unit is to cool your home, it’s probably normal to see ice, right? well, that is not the case.  
ice does not have any part in the cooling process of your system. if you see ice accumulating on your ac unit, then you’ve got an issue that you need to tackle immediately.  
ice on the ac isn’t a good thing 
people will often see an accumulation of ice on their ac units and assume that it is part of the process. they believe that their unit is doing a very great job since it’s producing ice. unluckily, that is not the case at all.  
if you’re one of these people, you should change your views immediately. an accumulation of ice on your ac unit is an indication of an issue. this is particularly true if the ice is located on the coil.  
if you don’t address this problem, that accumulation of ice will soon damage your unit. because of this, it’s always ideal to hire a professional hvac technician for help. 
why is your ac generating ice? 
for those who don’t know, there are a lot of potential reasons why there is a buildup of ice on your ac unit. this includes: 

low levels of refrigerant 

a lot of people think that refrigerant is like fuel from a car. they think that it’s meant to deplete over time. however, that isn’t the case. your ac unit has a leak if it is losing refrigerant. if a leak occurs, there is not enough refrigerant to absorb hot air from your house. thus, it will freeze over.  

a clogged evaporator coil 

for those who don’t know, dirt is a severe issue. if you allow dust and other debris to accumulate on the evaporator coil, it blocks the transfer of heat to the refrigerant. this results in the creation of ice on the coil since your system cannot absorb heat.  

a dirty air filter 

perhaps your air filter is filled with a lot of debris and dirt. if this is the case, the filter gets clogged and limits the airflow in the unit. therefore, there is not enough heat for the evaporator coil to absorb. 
if you see an accumulation of ice on your ac unit, the best thing you can do is to hire a professional hvac company. they can fix your ac unit and get rid of any underlying problems.
