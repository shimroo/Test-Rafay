a welcome from bernard cornwell
this is my website. there are others devoted to my books and some of them are very good, but this one is the authorised version. i want it to be useful, a place where you can find information about the novels and where you can discover suggestions for further reading. there’s a section for your questions and, if the answer you seek is not there, a place where you can contact me.  and a your comments section where you’ll find the comments of others and my responses where applicable.  i hope you’ll enjoy this website!  thanks for visiting.
