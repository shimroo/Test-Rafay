the pygora goat



























the versatile goat with the luxurious coat.



the pygora® goat was initially bred with the goal of creating an animal that would produce fine fiber for hand spinning. the foundation of the breed began by breeding a pygmy (npga registry), a goat with short, soft cashmere-like down, to an angora (aagba registry), a goat with long silky fleece. the pygora goat produces a wonderful, lofty, soft, fiber that does not coarsen as the goat ages. add in an affectionate, engaging personality, a manageable size, good health and fleece in a range of colors and you have the perfect fiber goat.
