saint gertrude high school
at saint gertrude, we combine the best of academic tradition, educational innovation, spiritual formation, and commitment to the service of others to create a high school experience unlike any other in the greater richmond area. we are different and it’s our difference that makes us special. all that’s unique about us – our values, our traditions, our diversity, our unity of sisterhood, and so much more – form a powerful combination of advantages that help our students grow, thrive, and lead. research continues to validate and quantify the advantages of single-sex education for girls over traditional co-educational settings. in spaces created specifically for them, girls can explore, nurture, and showcase their emerging talents and intellect, as well as their individuality. our graduates leave with the tools and confidence they need to be successful in college and beyond…no matter where life takes them. discover the saint gertrude advantage

grace rooney '23
saint gertrude's art classes are unlike others, in the way that they leave room for the artist to be fully authentic. the teachers not only support but encourage thinking outside the box.




lydia stumpf '25
i love sghs because of the welcoming environment. when i first got here, i thought an all-girls school would not be the best fit for me, but i found out that i love being able to speak my mind in class. i like having the boys on campus as well because of the co-ed feeling that i originally had at my old school. overall, i’ve only been here a few months but sghs already feels like home. 




buni neighbors, parent of arden '21
saint gertrude does a stellar job in preparing young girls to be effective and persuasive communicators. leaders need to express their thoughts clearly and confidently. sghs provides a jumpstart by teaching young women how to think clearly, write concisely, and speak cogently. and, sghs gives students an opportunity to practice – so they can become more and more comfortable in developing these foundational skills that will positively influence their lives – in college, career, and personally.




evelyn mcgill ’75
saint gertrude helped tremendously in the grounding of my spiritual development, the impetus for any success i’ve achieved. it is an awesome school for girls, providing opportunities that guarantee exemplary leadership development and unbreakable confidence within their soul. the future is even brighter with the remarriage with benedictine on the bsor campus; together they will make the impossible, possible and the world a better place!




meadow messerschmidt ’23
saint gertrude teachers really care about your grades and want to help you succeed. they really care about each individual and how each can grow to become a great student.




eloise mccall '25
i love that everyone is like a family, even if we are in totally different grades. i also love that the teachers want you to succeed in their classes. the best part about being on the same campus as the boys is that we can be stronger in our school spirit and our gratitude for our beautiful campus that we have here together.




elise hickman '23
i feel well prepared because of the rigorous academic program i'm provided with and the benedictine values i learned that will help me better serve my community. and, the leadership opportunities at saint gertrude are endless and allow room for us to grow and improve as individuals.




mike kehoe, parent of mary '21
saint gertrude’s and benedictine’s brightest years are right in front of us. the quality of the education, the catholic and benedictine values, the friendships that last a lifetime – all these things make these schools unique and important to the students, to their families, and really to the broader catholic community here in richmond.
