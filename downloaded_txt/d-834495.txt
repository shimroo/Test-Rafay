a legacy of making a difference in aortic dissection 



 for more than 20 years, the john ritter foundation has remained committed to our goal of raising awareness and changing outcomes.in 2003, john ritter — beloved actor, husband, father, and friend — died suddenly due to a misdiagnosed thoracic aortic dissection. since that time, his family and loved ones have worked to ensure his legacy helps save the lives of others. join us as we work to fund research, provide education, and raise awareness of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. together we can save lives. 










aortic dissections are preventable 



early detection and treatment can prevent premature deaths. your support can help us achieve a future where everyone receives the care they need and deserve.
