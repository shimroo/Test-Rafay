privacy policy


















































sjr is proud to be accredited and affiliated with several local, national and international educational organizations.




		st. john’s-ravenscourt school was founded in 1820 principally to serve the children of the selkirk settlers. by 1834 there were forty students, evenly split between boys and girls. sjr has inevitably grown and changed over the years since, though its success throughout has been unimpeachable. today the programs are as strong as our reputation. a strong academic program is paired with an equally strong attention to the values of stewardship, ethical leadership, and excellence in all areas of academic, social and athletic life.
