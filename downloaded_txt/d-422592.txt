in 
    the 1970's, the mego 
    corporation (mee-go) was one of the largest 
    toy manufacturing companies in the united states. along with hasbro's g.i. 
    joe (1964), & ideal's captain 
    action (1966), mego's "fully poseable" 
    toys paved the way for the highly articulated action figures of today.


 
    figures, mego produced a host of characters spanning many genres, including 
    super heroes, pirates, knights, monsters and legends. in addition, mego produced 
    likenesses from many hit televesion series and films of the time, including
hapy days, 
    star 
    trek, moonraker, 
    planet 
    of the apes and more. 
    

mego corp. closed 
    its doors in 1983. over the years since the company's demise, mego action 
    figures have become highly 
    collectible.
like many children 
    of the seventies and early eighties, i grew up with mego toys and re-discovered 
    their magic while looking through a box of my childhood toys. today i continue 
    to re-collect the originals as well as customize 
    some of my own.
i have fond memories 
    of the role mego action figures played in my childhood. the purpose of this 
    site is to share those memories and the wonderful nostalgic world of mego 
    with everyone. enjoy!
