jesus and the other disciplepeter turned around and saw behind him that other disciple, whom jesus loved -- the one who had leaned close to jesus at the meal and had asked, "lord, who is going to betray you?"  when peter saw him, he asked jesus, "lord, what about this man?"jesus answered him, "if i want him to live until i come, what is that to you?  follow me!"so a report spread among the followers of jesus that this disciple would not die.  but jesus did not say he would not die; he said, "if i want him to live until i come, what is that to you?"he is the disciple who spoke of these things, the one who also wrote them down; and we know that what he said is true.conclusionnow, there are many other things that jesus did.  if they were all written down one by one, i suppose that the whole world could not hold the books that would be written.- john 201:20-25technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

jesus and peterafter they had eaten, jesus said to simon peter, "simon son of john, do you love me more than these others do?""yes, lord," he answered, "you know that i love you."jesus said to him, "take care of my lambs."  a second time jesus said to him, "simon son of john, do you love me?""yes, lord," he answered, "you know that i love you."jesus said to him, take care of my sheep."  a third time jesus said, simon son of john, do you love me?"peter became sad because jesus asked him the third time, "do you love me?" and so he said to him, "lord, you know everything; you know that i love you!"jesus said to him, "take care of my sheep.  i am telling you the truth: when you were young, you used to get ready and go anywhere you wanted to; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will tie you up and take you where you don't want to go."  (in saying this, jesus was indicating the way in which peter would die and bring glory to god.)  then jesus said to him, "follow me!"- john 21:15-19technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

paul's fare speech to the elders of ephesus"so keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock which the holy spirit has placed in your care.  be shepherds of the church of god, which he made his own through the blood of his son.  i know that after i leave, fierce wolves will come among you, and they will not spare the flock.  the time will come when some men from your own group will tell lies to lead the believers away after them.  watch, then, and remember that with many tears, day and night, i taught every one of you for three years."and now i commend you to the care of god and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you the blessings god has for all his people.  i have not wanted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.  you yourselves know that i have worked with these hands of mine to provide everything that my companions and i have needed.  i have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way we must help the weak, remembering the words that the lord jesus himself said, 'there is more happiness in giving than in receiving.'"when paul finished, he knelt down with them and prayed.  they were all crying as they hugged him and kissed him good-bye.  they were especially sad because he had said that they would never see him again.  and so they went with him to the ship.- acts 20:28-38technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

jesus speaks a third time about his deathas jesus was going up to jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and spoke to them privately, as they walked along.  "listen," he told them, "we are going up to jerusalem, where the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law.  they will condemn him to death and then hand him over to the gentiles, who will make fun of him, whip him, and crucify him; but three days later he will be raised to life."a mother's requestthen the wife of zebedee came to jesus with her two sons, bowed before him, and asked him for a favor."what do you want?" jesus asked her.she answered, "promise me that these two sons of mine will sit at your right and your left when you are king.""you don't know what you are asking for," jesus answered the sons.  "can you drink the cup of suffering that i am about to drink?""we can," they answered."you will indeed drink from my cup," jesus told them, "but i do not have the right to choose who will sit at my right and my left.  these places belong to those for whom my father has prepared them."when the other ten disciples heard about this, they became angry with the two brothers.  so jesus called them all together and said, "you know that the rulers of the heathen have power over them, and the leaders have complete authority.  this, however, is not the way it shall be among you.  if one of you wants to be great, you must be the servant of the rest; and if one of you wants to be first, you  must be the salve of the others -- like the son of man, who did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life to redeem many people."technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

judging othersbe merciful just as your father is merciful.do not judge others, and god will  not judge you; do not condemn others, and god will not condemn you; forgive others, and god will forgive you.  give to others, and god will give to you.  indeed, you will receive a full measure, a generous helping, poured into your hands -- all that you can hold.  the measure you use for others is the one that god will use for you.- luke 6:36-38technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

teaching about prayer"when you pray, do not use a lot of meaningless words, as the pagans do, who think that their gods will hear them because their prayers are long.  do not be like them.  your father already knows what you need before you ask him.  this, then, is how you should pray:'our father in heaven:may your holy name be honored;may your kingdom come;may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.give us today the food we need.forgive us the wrongs we have done.as we forgive the wrongs that others have done to us.do not bring us to hard testing,but keep us safe from the evil one."if you forgive others the wrongs they have done to you, your father in heaven will also forgive you.  but if you do not forgive others, then your father will not forgive the wrongs you have done."- matthew 6:7-15technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

laws of holiness and justicethe lord told moses to say to the community of israel, "be holy, because i, the lord your god, am holy. "do not steal or cheat or lie.  do not make a promise in my name if you do not intend to keep it; that brings disgrace on my name.  i am the lord your god."do not rob or take advantage of anyone.  do not hold back the wages of someone you have hired, not even for one night.  do not curse the deaf or put something in front of the blind so as to make them stumble over it.  obey me; i am the lord your god."be honest and just when you make decisions in legal cases; do not show favoritism to the poor or fear the rich.  do not spread lies about anyone, and when someone is on trial for his life, speak out if your testimony can help him.  i am the lord."do not bear a grudge against others, but settle your differences with them, so that you will not commit a sin because of them.  do not take revenge on others or continue to hate them, but love your neighbors as you love yourself.  i am the lord."- leviticus 19:1-2, 11-18technorati tags: catholicbibledaily biblecatholic bible

about
daily bible readings from today's english version.  please feel free to write down your reflections.

about me

name:  toe 
location:  phnom penh, cambodia 
pictionary used to be in vogue when i was in high school (oops!  i'm dating myself).  so when my classmates and i would pass notes during class (texting wasn't invented yet), we'd sign with drawings depicting our names (not exactly egyptians hieroglyphics).  mine would be a picture of a toe (well, a foot actually, a toe would just be a dot) and a net.  later on, i'd just draw a toe... well, because i was lazy.  so everyone called me toe and... that's it, the name stuck!
