this week in team penske history

 
brad keselowski drives the no. 22 discount tire dodge at daytona in 2010. 



this week in team penske history
february 12, 2015
djr team penske announces that scott pye joins marcos ambrose to compete in the 2015 australian supercars championship with the djr team penske team.

pye would go on to replace ambrose in the no. 17 ford for most of the 2015 season, including securing djr team penske’s first series podium finish in november during the auckland 500 weekend at pukekohe park raceway.

february 13, 2010
brad keselowski makes his nascar xfinity series debut for team penske, driving the no. 22 discount tire dodge charger in the season-opening race at daytona international speedway.
keselowski starts the 120-lap race in the 24th position after qualifying is rained out at daytona.  as he methodically works his way to the front of the field, keselowski captures the race lead on lap 62 and runs inside the top five until lap 91, when an accident shuffles the no. 22 car back in the pack. keselowski takes the checkered flag in 13th place to begin the season that would feature six wins and the first-ever nascar series title for team penske.
