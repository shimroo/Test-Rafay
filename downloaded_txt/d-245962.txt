i know about code quick and i am ready to order now



morse code  you'll never forgetlearn morse code and be on the air in two weeks or less!​let me introduce myself. i am dr. jerry wheeler, w6tjp.   i've had lots of amazing ham fun and met some terrific ham friends since 1952! it's great to give back by seeing newer hams have the fun i've had! before i came up with code quick, i tried for almost 20 years to master the code but could never get faster than about 15 wpm. one day in the middle of the night, thank god, the idea of code quick hit me! i tried it on my guinea pig wife and it worked! she has never used it but can still copy 8wpm, 50+ years later! i passed my 20 wpm test within a couple of months! code quick has been available in various forms since 1980. it works - here's why!other learning systems depend on you memorizing a sound and its corresponding code. nothing ties dah-di-di to a d. but there's a way to do it! it makes it so much easier!only code quick teaches each character as a sound-alike in simple english.it's the natural way you think in the language center of your brain where all the power is!​ the letter "d" shows a picture of a dog messing your carpet. think "dog did it" not dah-di-di. it's that simple! ugly thought = memory glue! each character has been carefully researched and it will stick for you!our company can stay alive only if it works, because 80% of our orders are word of mouth!code quick was developed in 1980! it's still alive because nearly everyone who tries succeeds! steve warren ks4he writes:i am an extra class and was originally licensed in 1993. there was a code requirement back then, and i wanted to upgrade my license. i tried several methods before i stumbled across the advertisement in the back of qst. i ordered a set of code quick cassette tapes and started hitting them every morning and evening until i learned all the characters. code quick was the only method i tried that worked, and i think i tried them all. i used a little shareware program on my old 286 computer (remember those?) to drill. it could be set to play random qsos and you could speed it up as you studied. i passed the 20 wpm and got my extra, and i have operated about 90% cw since then.steve ks4hethere are a few nay-sayers out there. guys who never tried code quick who might tell you it is just a crutch that eventually slows down copy.  they still remember how it took them more than a couple of years to learn code by sweat and tears! (maybe they would rather you suffer like they did!) when you do it that way, the part of the brain at work is where you store environmental sounds like thuds, thunks, clunks and squeaks. in that part of the brain, length of the sound and frequency are quite sound specific. if you change the pitch or the length of the sound, definition is lost. so, people who do it that way might copy 20wpm code but not 12wpm code because the characters make totally different sounds to them. its a ton of hard work learning several sets of code in the weakest part of the brain, and like learning music, some are talented, but most of us are not so lucky.we are so confident of your success that we'll buy you any other morse code course of your choice if you try ours and then you are disappointed!over 60,000 success stories over 40+ years. just ask hams who learned code quick. they will tell you it is fast, fun and it sticks forever!learn it this way and keep your skill for a lifetime! learn it wrong and forget it tomorrow!it's cheap considering the 100's of hours you'll save! it's easy since it goes to the language brain, the strongest and fastest part!you owe it to yourself to add this skill that could save your life or the life of your family member!hundreds of preppers have added morse code to their survival kit! when all else fails, you'll still get through, even with a flashlight!why not enjoy the prestige that comes as a coded ham?best of all, you can be off and running in as little as 12 hours! over 160 years old, morse code is still alive and thriving all over the world!  it is truly the universal language!  jump on any amateur radio band and you'll see how morse code gets through when other modes jam up! experience what real "punch through" means! the bandwidth that's used is narrow so lots of hams can share a close frequency without blocking (qrming) other signals.

w6tjp the author of code quick here.here's my own story..... originally wn7rbo.  got my first novice ticket in 1952 passing 5wpm the hard way.  got on the air for the next 20 years without ever mastering the code but kept working at it. finally one night i woke up with the idea of using sound-alikes because one of my teachers had said "listen to the letter q... it says 'pay day today'. i know you'll never forget your payday!"that worked! the letter q stuck and i knew it at any speed. wow what a wake up call that was for me! for the next several months i kept everyone i knew dreaming up good sound-alikes till we had them all. next i rented a recording studio to make a set of cassette tapes, put a small add in qst and we were off to the races.  the praises just kept rolling in and eventually code quick was the rage and everyone was passing the morse tests all the way to 20wpm.​it is still selling only because it works like magic! so many old timers keep recommending it!
