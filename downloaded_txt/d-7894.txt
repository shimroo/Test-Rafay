best beginner yoga teacher in chapel hill 















if you are just getting started with yoga, you do not want to walk into a studio with buddha statues all over the place, colorful rugs hanging on the wall and a bunch of weirdos chanting “ommmm” for no reason whatsoever. if you’ve never been in a yoga studio before, this is what you probably think it is like. while there are some yoga studios in chapel hill, north carolina that are like this, not all of them are. when you walk into yogasix chapel hill you will find it is much more like walking into an apple store. there are modern graphics, cool lights and instructors have spotify playlists of soft, yet modern music. at this studio, you will find jesse wojdylo, who is the restore instructor. you can find is restorewithjesse instagram here.
what makes a restore class with jesse so accessible and accommodating for all body types is the fact that jesse took his very first yoga class at age 40 at yogasix chapel hill. he went through the transformation of being a very tense and tight person into a much more open, soft and relaxed person. having taken over 400 yoga classes at the studio, he developed a teaching style that works for those that are just getting started on their yoga mat.
when you attend one of jesse’s classes you will not have to worry about knowing the vocabulary of all the poses. he is not going to say, “get into supta baddha konasana” at any time. he will gently guide you into positions that are comfortable for your body type. each of these poses will help you better understand why the body does what it does. throughout class jesse will offer modifications and suggestions to help you deepen your yoga practice. this means if it is your first time in a yoga class, you may better understand why you struggle to touch your toes. if it is your 500th yoga class, you may very well understand why holding the inside of your foot in dancer pose allows you to externally rotate your hip and kick the weight and strength into the hand on the inside of the extended leg to improve your balance and allow yourself to lean forward further.
another reason jesse is the best beginner yoga instructor in chapel hill is the fact that he understands how to puzzle piece a bolster or block into the perfect place to allow your body to relax and enjoy a complete release. instead of fighting your shin to the floor in pigeon pose, jesse will offer a bolster down the middle of the body as support. he may also offer a block on the forehead to soften the muscles in the neck, shoulders and back. as a beginner in a yoga studio, it takes a lot to understand why certain poses should “feel good.” many beginners, especially men, try to power into poses and never truly “feel good” in a yoga studio or in their body.
if you want to feel good in your body and better understand what it is to find complete relaxation and restoration, go to one of jesse’s restore classes at yogasix chapel hill.
