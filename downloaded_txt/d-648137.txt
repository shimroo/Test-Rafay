an innovative architecture for coordinating low-level measurements from dc to 100 khzthe measureready™ m81-ssm synchronous source and measure system eliminates the complexity of multiple function-specific instrumentation setups. it combines the convenience of dc and ac sourcing with dc and ac measurement, including a lock-in’s sensitivity and measurement performance.the m81-ssm ensures synchronized measurements from 1 to 3 source channels and from 1 to 3 measure channels per half-rack instrument. when its bcs-10 and vm-10 modules are combined, it offers differential wiring to the sample—a proven method of minimizing environmental noise pickup that can interfere with low-level measurements.
