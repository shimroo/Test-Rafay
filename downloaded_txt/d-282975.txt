  otello




       

  la sonnambula
by vincenzo bellinifeb 14, 16, 22, 23, 2025a young woman is accused of infidelity just before her wedding.  but it turns out she's just a sleepwalker. a seemingly simple story that reveals a lot about the prejudice facing women in a male-dominated society. this is a true gem of the bel canto repertoire, featuring some of bellini's most gorgeous vocal writing.josé luis moscovich - stage dir and cond.
