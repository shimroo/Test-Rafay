selling russian fine art and antiques since 1974

 












welcome to our gallery.








iconastas was established by chris martin-zakheim and john gaze in 1975. it traded for over 40 years, most of that time from a small gallery in piccadilly arcade, sw1, in london’s west end. now that our shop in piccadilly arcade is closed, we work by email and appointment only. to get in touch drop us a line. we are happy to ship items around the world and will get you a quote from the courier; we usually use ups but can use any courier that you'd prefer to specify.

is there still a market for lenin statues?












chris was recently asked to come into the bbc world service studio to chat about lenin statues - in particular one monumental one that was being exported to germany. if you'd like to listen to some of this interview, click on the image above. 





who wants russian wood - podcast

one of chris’s past customers was the comedian ricky gervais, who was fascinated about the icons.little did we realise that we were to become fodder for one his pod-casts! go to 16:45 seconds to hear them talk about one of his visits when he took karl pilkington with him.

who wants russian wood - cartoon

from the ricky gervais show - karl pilkington recounts a story about a wood carving he saw in a shop in london. it was some russian saint that got mugged and decided to go live in the woods in a shack he built. karl doesn't think the bloke deserves a sainthood for it.
