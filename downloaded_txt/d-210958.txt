we built a new way to run cold outbound at scale—and it finally just works.*




*by just works, we mean it fills your calendars with high-intent sales calls and generates you a bunch of new revenue. we’re on track to win over $600m in pipeline for startups this year.

cold email has a frustrating tradeoff: either you sacrifice quality for volume, or you spend way too much money for people to sit around and write one or two great emails a day.aurora is different. every email we send is timely, thoughtful and relevant. and there’s no catch—we can do it at infinite scale.we win you millions in pipeline. your team just takes sales calls (lots of them).



we send emails that get you replies like this:







































how it really works



other agencies hide their tactics behind buzzwords—then send emails you’d be embarrassed to put your name on. aurora makes you look good and lands you meetings by finding leads that actually want what you’re selling, then sending them thoughtful, personalized emails.here are the ingredients that make up our system:




we use ai carefully, to fill in the blanks. ai is terrible at writing entire emails, and people’s internal ai-detection algorithms can already sniff it out. but, ai is great at writing tightly-constrained variables. we place these variables inside thoughtful templates written by humans, so every email is personal.we target by pain, not persona. we’ll scour the internet to find buyers that actually have the pain your product solves (ex. open job roles, customer reviews, company news, job changes, and more). then, we reach out to them.we give you a single control center for >100 inboxes. gone are the volume bottlenecks of 1 sdr = 1 inbox. when you work with us, you send at whatever scale you’d like to send at.



why not hire someone else?



scaling personalized cold outbound is easy to do wrong—which has consequences for both your brand (making you look bad) and your business (losing you money).when you work with us, you’re in good hands. we’ve sent millions of emails, generated nearly $1b in pipeline, and are neurotically obsessed with getting the little details right so everything goes smoothly. and, our team has that scrappy startup muscle. we’ve founded, and worked at, lots of startups prior to aurora.



how much it costs



it costs $8,595 / mo, minimum, to work with aurora. that’s roughly what you’d pay a single good sdr—except for 17x the output.**yes, this is weirdly specific. we did the math. on our starter plan, you’ll be sending 17x the volume of a typical sdr. and the emails will be a lot more thoughtful and relevant (meaning, ~100x more value).
