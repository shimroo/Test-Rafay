sunday activities from 9:30am
trinity is not only about the sunday worship - it is a community of people and of friends. 
              we have sunday school for kids and bible studies for adults. there is a singing choir, a bell choir and a modern praise band. 
              all activities are not only for the members of trinity, they are open for non-members too.
            









adult bible studies

                the adult bible study is looking at the book disciple maker by pastor phil bickel. this is one of the most amazing movements happening in missions today. all over the world, christians are learning to make disciples in some of the hardest to reach areas, places that have always been resistant to the gospel before now. this book will help us to begin to grasp a whole new direction in christian outreach that is already harvesting thousands into the kingdom of god. the class is open to everyone, including post-confirmation youth. we encourage everyone to attend this exciting class.
              








sunday school

                we aim to teach the kids about jesus christ, through the simple media of christian songs and biblical stories. we offer classes for kids from kindergarten, primary and middle school. 
              








confirmation class

                trinity offers confirmation program every year when there is sufficient interest from september until may. confirmation instruction is available to youth in seventh grade or above.
              








worship service sunday at 11 am
