what can you expect?





guiding, setting expectations and outcomes, truly listening etc. while also handling office politics, silos and 'real world' problems are some of the issues most leaders do not simultaneously manage well. i have 
work
ed with evan goodman for over a year and find him very clear in all his communication. he focuses on what matters first and works methodically through each process to achieve the desired goal. i would definitely recommend him. samit industry • owner

from my early stages of shopping around, i found tenfold to be a stand-out firm. the professionalism of their qualifying process showed that they know their stuff. to be honest, i was still sceptical after my experience with the previous tradie coach. then i met with mace and i was convinced tenfold were different from the other stock-standard coaches. i was very impressed with their genuine approach because i could see that they were going to be the coaches to get me the tangible results i was after. since 
start
ing with tenfold business coaching in october 2016, we have worked closely on pricing and quoting.

“i took on a big contract, took on some new staff to handle the load, and then things went really badly for me… i wasn’t present enough in the business at the time. my contract pricing wasn’t accurate. the builders i was working for weren’t crash hot and i lost a load of 
money
 and i didn’t even realise it. i was forced to scale back my business. i realised i needed help to build back up. when i found out about the academy, it clicked and it made sense to me to get on board and give it a crack.

what to do if you have mould





march 16, 2022
flash flooding and heavy rains have caused severe disruption and 
damage
 across sydney, as storms and unprecedented rains continue to lash the city. the humidity soared to 90% on tuesday and the rain is expected to last throughout the week.

these weather events have overwhelmed many properties, from commercial facilities to homes and offices. many drainage systems cannot cope and allow water to ingress building envelopes and cause problems with mould. even properties that have survived any flooding or leaks can still find mould blooming inside due to elevated relative humidity. homeowners are reporting staining on ceilings and walls, rising damp, wet and sodden carpets throughout, leading to a proliferation of mould growth to all surfaces and contents that needs mould tests and mould assessment.
our technicians are highly trained and certified in water damage, water extraction, wet carpet resolution and structural drying of all building components such as plasterboard, timber frames, concrete, carpet, brick
work
 and all internal contents such as cupboards, furniture and basically anything that is wet. disaster restorations australia are experts in dealing with insurance companies and restoration programs for both residential and commercial clients and provide a 24/7 call centre for emergency work and we aim to attend to you water or flood damaged property within 2 hours of your call. by providing this prompt service we can ensure that your property has the best chance to avoid secondary damage such as mould contamination that can result from delayed restoration.
disaster payments available for more nsw flood-impacted residents
media release
prime minister, acting minister for government services, minister for emergency management
disaster payments available for more nsw 
flood
-impacted residents
australian government disaster payments are available now to eligible residents in six additional local government areas (lgas), affected by the severe storms and flooding that continue to impact large areas of new south wales.

the one-off, non-means tested australian government disaster recovery payment of $1000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child is available to people living in those lgas who have suffered a significant loss as a result of the floods, including a severely damaged or destroyed home or a serious injury.
heartache for flood hit communities
local councils are facing staggering multimillion-dollar damage costs from devastating flooding “natural disasters” that have decimated local communities. damage caused by flooding in new south wales and the “rain bomb” that hit queensland is already estimated to cost around $5 billion — and this does not include the cost of constructing new infrastructure to better protect properties or to relocate susceptible homes. the massive bill is just a taste of things to come with experts warning the cost of extreme weather events is expected to be around $25 billion a year by 2100. this figure does not include costs for repairing public infrastructure, only damage to private property.
plan for an emergency
make a plan for your household, including your pets , so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area. in case of emergency
keep important documents in a waterproof container. create password-protected digital copies. protect your property. move valuables to higher levels. declutter drains and gutters. install check valves.
moreton bay regional council embarked on an australian first process of developing a comprehensive lga-wide gis database of topographic data and using that along with one hydrological modelling program, one hydraulic modelling program, and consistent assumptions across all catchments, to simultaneously produce flood models for 13 catchments covering 2,000km2. the outputs were then used to inform floodplain planning, emergency response and community education. molino stewart worked with moreton bay regional council and undertook the first stage of the floodplain risk management study. steven molino was a member of the strategic advisory group guiding the project development and implementation and was the technical expert providing advice on landuse planning, emergency planning, warning and community education.

as a tenant you have rights under the residential tenancies act 2010 and residential tenancies regulation 2019. this factsheet is about damage to rented premises that is neither the fault of the landlord nor the tenant – the result of a storm, fire or flood, or other causes of such damage (e. g. a car crashes into the premises). this factsheet also applies if you rent a home in a residential land lease community (sometimes called a residential or caravan park). however if you own a home in a land lease community, please see our land lease communities factsheet on natural disasters.
as most people are well aware, the immediate impacts of flooding include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. as communication links and infrastructure such as power plants, roads and bridges are damaged and disrupted, some economic activities may come to a standstill, people are forced to leave their homes and normal life is disrupted. similarly, disruption to industry can lead to loss of livelihoods. damage to infrastructure also causes long-term impacts, such as disruptions to supplies of clean water, wastewater treatment, electricity, transport, communication, education and health care.

accidental flood water damage is covered with most comprehensive car insurance policies. that said, some insurance providers may deem driving into flood water a reckless act and as such may refuse a claim for flood water damage in some cases. besides the possibility of not having a car insurance claim accepted, emergency services across the country advise against driving into a flooded area. in fact, vicses (victoria state emergency services) are currently running a campaign to raise awareness around just how dangerous driving into flood water can be. ﻿related: guide to all things flood insurance.
an unexpected pipe burst soaked the winter growth adult day care and assisted living facility in olney, maryland. when flood damage pro received the call, they asked us to come quick. they had a company there, doing more damage than repair, and they needed a professional. we weren't the first on the scene, but we were definitely the last. flood damage pro got the job done, and winter growth was back to business as usual.

5 common types of water damage and how to fix them
water damage is one of the most common causes of property damage.

you wouldn’t expect your refrigerator to ruin your kitchen and floors, or even destroy support structures in your home, but it’s actually very possible. home water damage can be caused by leaking fixtures and appliances or faulty pipes and hoses. these leaks can range from a trickle that can cause harm overtime, to a sudden burst that can cause immediate impact to your home. luckily, with a few simple precautions you may greatly reduce the chances of water damaging your home.
if you discover any signs of water damage to your foundation, it is important to let a professional look at it and assess the damages that may have already occurred. also, you should not try to fix your home’s foundation unless you have years of experience working on homes or repairing these types of issues as some methods can even be counterproductive!
we have foundation damage restoration technicians that can identify the severity of the foundation water damage & repair the foundation problems. for disasters of all sizes,available in 95% of the usa.
exposure to water-damaged buildings causes many health effects. the complex mixture of contaminants present in the air and in the dust of water damaged buildings form levels of toxicity that can lead to a variety of symptoms commonly known as inflammatory response and includes mould illness. there are many ways buildings become home to a toxic mix of microbes and harmful chemicals. structures can promote the growth of fungi and bacteria, as a result of construction defects, damp subfloor areas, and buildings exposed to saturated groundwater conditions, excessive condensation, and exposure to constant high humidity, water ingress events which are not correctly remediated.
does your home insurance cover water damage?
different types of water damage are insured by different types of policies. homeowners and renters insurance provides coverage for burst pipes, wind driven rain and damage resulting from ice dams on your roof. generally speaking, water that comes from the top down—such as rainfall and burst sprinklers—is covered by a standard homeowners policy. some policies cover sewer and drain backups , but many do not; however, you can purchase a sewer backup rider to your homeowners or renters coverage. typically, water that comes from the bottom up—such as an overflowing river—is covered by a separate flood insurance policy, which can be purchased from the federal government’s national flood insurance program (nfip), and from some private insurers.
when you consider the statistics, it becomes clear just how common and devastating a problem water damage can be. according to industry estimates, 14,000 people in the us experience a water damage emergency at home or work each day, and 98% of basements in the us will suffer from some type of water damage during their lifetime. the costs are just a staggering as the frequency. water damage and mold cost the insurance industry $2. 5 billion dollars per year, and the average cost of a home water damage insurance claim is $6,965. water leaks alone leave incredible amounts of damage and immense waste in their wake.
now, water damage is making up 34% of all of chubb australia’s property-related claims – so insurance business reached out to michelle o’dowd, underwriting manager, australia and new zealand, personal lines, at chubb, to find out what’s going on. “there are a couple of key reasons for the increase in water damage claims in australia,” she explained. “firstly, modern living requires more plumbed-in appliances using flexi hoses, more bathrooms and laundries on upper levels of homes and more open-plan living spaces. the typical manufacturer’s warranty on a flexi hose (plastic tube with steel braid around it) is 10 years, so replacement should take place within this time by a licensed plumber.
damaged flexible hoses are a major cause of water damage in australian homes
insurance can provide cover, but sentimental items can be destroyed, and homes left unliveable during the repair process
check and replace your flexi hoses regularly. an unassuming, inexpensive plumbing kit item is the culprit behind thousands of dollars in water damage to australian homes. escaped water from a burst braided flexible hose can cause significant damage, leave a home unliveable, and destroy sentimental items in a matter of hours. burst braided flexible hoses are a major cause of water damage in australian homes. escaped water from a flexible hose can cause tens of thousands of dollars in water damage, leave a home unliveable, and destroy sentimental items in a matter of hours.
how to check for water damage
floods or severe storms may badly soil or damage asbestos-containing products resulting in the material needing cleaning or removal. if the material has dried since the flood or storm wet it with water (do not use a high pressure hose as this may break the surface and release asbestos fibres). asbestos materials can be cleaned with soapy water and a cloth or sponge or with light scrubbing (eg soft brush or broom) or with a garden hose. regularly check the surface of the material you are cleaning to make sure it is not being damaged. if the asbestos materials are beyond cleaning and require removal engage a licensed asbestos removalist or see our homeowners page for information on removing the asbestos yourself.
stains can be identified as yellowish-brown marks that appear in an irregular shape which comes through excessive leakage of water. they are primarily found in bathrooms, basements, and the space beneath kitchen sinks. check your house carefully, and if you discover any of these, you should contact a water damage restoration service provider right once.
how to claim for water damage
we will pay claims for all genuine out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a direct consequence of negligence on our behalf. all claims are investigated and assessed on a case-by-case basis. we will not pay claims for damage caused by third parties or events outside its control, such as accidents, weather, vandalism, or interference from vegetation or animals. any reimbursement offered will reflect the fair and reasonable cost to repair the damage. please note that it is our policy to replace damaged items with 'like for like' rather than 'new for old'. we suggest that you contact your insurance company directly for losses resulting from external causes or events beyond icon water’s control.
water damage to homes and businesses is extremely common. how common?
recent estimates suggest that every year 1 in 50 homeowners will file a
water damage claim with their insurance. that’s about 24% of all insurance
claims. water damage cleanup is costly, too. the average property owner
will spend about $3,153 when water damage occurs. despite the potential expense, you can’t let the sticker shock stop you
from thoroughly taking care of water damage to your home or business. in
fact, when it comes to water damage, not only is it vital that it’s taken
care of, but the clock is ticking if you want your water cleanup efforts.
