5 thoughts on tina smith's retirement





i have largely been off of social media today, so i'm doing a bit of catchup, but i wanted to talk a little bit about my home state of minnesota, which had huge political news today with the retirement of minnesota sen. tina smith.  as we frequently do on the blog for major announcements like this, i am doing a "5 thoughts" article on the subject.sen. tina smith (d-mn)1. sen. tina smith retiressen. tina smith's path to the senate was unusual.  amidst the al franken scandal, she was tapped by gov. dayton (she was his lieutenant governor) to replace franken when the latter resigned in 2018.  smith quickly won steady (but not klobuchar-style) reelections in 2018 and 2020, and while she initially seemed to meld into the background of the senate, eventually she seemed to stick-out a bit.  as the only former employee of planned parenthood in the upper chamber, smith has been ardently pro-choice, and honestly is one of the most consistently progressive voices in the chamber, even becoming one of the first senators to talk about expanding the supreme court.  franken's resignation, seven years after the fact, is still a source of consternation amongst dfl circles (if you've followed this blog long, you'll know that i was very supportive of him resigning at the time, and still think that was the right decision), but one of the realities that is rarely discussed when talking about franken leaving office is that smith might actually have been more progressive than franken would've been in the remaining years of his term.  she certainly kept the seat blue when franken would've struggled to do in 2020 (when he certainly would've under-run joe biden).  as one of her constituents, she's my favorite senator i've ever had, and though i'm glad she's leaving pragmatically (i think more democrats in blue/purple districts should consider leaving in 2026 when it'll be a good midterm year so it'll be easier to hold in an open seat election-jeanne shaheen & dick durbin, this means you), she's the member of congress i'm most consistently proud to claim i elected, and i'll miss her.gov. tim walz (d-mn)2. what will tim walz do?similar to the recent announcement by sen. gary peters that he would retire from the senate after two terms in michigan, the first name on everyone's list is going to be the governor, in this case 2024 vice presidential nominee tim walz.  while gretchen whitmer quickly ruled out a run in michigan, walz seemed open to the idea, though there are definitely indications that he might skip the race (more on that in a second).  walz would be the heavy favorite if he ran.  while he lost last year's vice presidential race, he remains popular in minnesota, and this would allow him to stay in office while avoiding running for the dreaded third term as governor, as minnesota voters generally have turned governors who reach for it down (just ask rudy perpich).  walz's political future is hazy-unlike whitmer, it's not clear if he still has national ambitions to run in 2028 for president, and it's also possible that even if he did, he'd be a footnote (failed vice presidential candidates like joe lieberman & john edwards are good examples of how it's not a great launchpad for your future endeavors).  but if he runs, walz would be the heavy favorite for both the primary and the general.lt. gov. peggy flanagan (d-mn)3. a walz vs. flanagan primary is unlikely (but not impossible)the best indication that walz is not considering running, however, is that his lieutenant governor is already in the race.  there are downsides to calling "first!" in a senate primary, but the upsides are honestly high if you're a big enough name, and lt. gov. peggy flanagan already getting into the race like this is a way to sort of force a lot of other democrats' hands.  it's still not clear, for example, whether or not walz is interested in a race at all (there were some indications that walz was looking at retiring if he didn't win the vice presidency last year), so there are democrats who could be interested in running for governor.  though walz & flanagan's relationship was once really strong, (according to reports) tim & gwen walz did not like how flanagan handled herself during the 2024 election, and their relationship has soured to the point that they rarely do public events together.  still, i struggle to see a world where they both pursue this seat, particularly given that flanagan could've had a clear shot at whatever race walz didn't go for and will be a very big underdog against walz in a senate primary.  if they are in a primary against each other, it would be a tabloid sensation, and also really foolish on flanagan's part as she'd likely lose when she could've won another race.rep. ilhan omar (d-mn)4. the rest of the bench is a mixed bagi'll be totally transparent in saying that, as a voter, if walz doesn't run, i'm leaning toward rep. angie craig or secretary of state steve simon.  both out-performed their tickets, and both are in the same profile of klobuchar & smith: progressives who act like moderates (though one could make the argument that craig is an actual moderate, at least more so than smith or simon) but are generally loyal to the party.  the minnesota senate race will start out, in my opinion as likely democrat, and given her public feud with walz, i do wonder if flanagan might be a risky bet right now, though i do also think she'd be the favorite if she got the nomination.there are a few names, though, that would struggle on the dfl bench.  despite having a solid up-ballot lead for walz & simon, state auditor julie blaha and attorney general keith ellison both nearly lost their races, and honestly i think would pose a serious risk of losing this seat if they were the nominees.  the same could be said for rep. ilhan omar, who has publicly indicated she's looking at a bid.  omar has the worst under-performance of the harris ticket of any incumbent democrat in congress...and that's after having the worst under-performance of joe biden.  were she to run, she'd almost certainly lose the primary, and honestly it'd be a godsend for dfl-ers who are tired of her in the 5th district (which is ultimately why i don't think she will, as i think she'll be able to hold the 5th again in 2026 in the primary even after the falls of cori bush & jamaal bowman last cycle).the one name i worry most about is franken's.  franken currently lives in new york city (not minnesota), but remains popular with the progressive base (just look on social media right now and you'll see many calls for him to be the nominee).  i think (absent walz) he'd be the frontrunner for the nomination...but would lose the general election.  the long assumption amongst his acolytes is that there was nothing more to the accusations in 2018 (which still feels like a stretch...a risk that's not worth taking), and having him run would mean that democrats would have to stake a controversial senate nominee while they attempt to make gains elsewhere.  it is not worth it, and i pray that franken will avoid the race.rep. pete stauber (r-mn)5. the republicans need a candidate toowhile the democrats have a wide bench (even if some aren't worth their time for this race), there will be a republican in the race, and if franken or omar or ellison or blaha is their opponent...they would be taken seriously.  who that person is is a genuine question.  rep. tom emmer is already out of the race (he likely would've gotten right of first refusal), so my eyes are now on rep. pete stauber, who picked up this seat in 2018 one of the only republicans to flip a seat red that cycle, who ruled out a gubernatorial race, but might be interested in running here.  stauber is also the only major name that might be considered a-list in the same vein as walz, flanagan, craig, & simon (you could claim brad finstad or michelle fischbach are as well, but neither seems to be signaling an interest).  state sens. michelle benson & paul gazelka, nba player royce white, & state sen. scott jensen would all be potential candidates...they also all lost their last statewide bids.  state rep. kristin robbins would be an interesting choice, but she's also the rare suburban republican in the state house...which would mean her seat would be potentially gettable as the dfl tries to win back sole control over the house next year.

the disturbing reality of nancy mace





rep. nancy mace (r-sc)when rep. nancy mace (r-sc) was first elected to congress in 2020, she was elected largely under the guise of being a more moderate figure in the party.  running against incumbent rep. joe cunningham in a right-leaning (but moving to the center) swing district, she needed to strike a more moderate tone, as cunningham was popular & well-positioned & was very much in the running to win a second term if she didn't pull things together.  mace won that election, and like many candidates, became more partisan while in office, but generally did try to strike a more moderate balance.  on abortion, for example, she made a point of wanting exemptions for rape victims, talking about how she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, and she voted in favor of the equal access to contraception for veterans act in 2021, one of only a handful of republicans who backed the bill which would provide easier access to birth control.  she also voted in favor of the respect for marriage act, which provided protection for same-sex marriage under federal law, and initially stood behind her colleague liz cheney when there was an attempt to oust her from the gop leadership.mace's public profile over the past few months, though, has caught significant public attention and honestly concern from neutral observers.  mace's physical appearance has transformed quite a bit (she has lost a significant amount of weight), which on its own would not be particularly noteworthy, but coupled with some of her actions is something i feel needs to come up in today's article (also, she has blamed the change in her appearance on twitter by saying it is a result of "ptsd").  her public statements have become increasingly erratic.  she has talked about drones invading from outer space, or "outside the universe."  she has become deeply transphobic in her public statements, yelling trans slurs during congressional hearings and staging bizarre photo shoots, including accusing someone of attacking her (she even wore a sling in public) when most onlookers observed that the man she accused of assault merely shook her hand.  mace has publicly worn costumes (including a shirt with the letter "a" on it, referencing the scarlet letter), and claimed on fox news that she had "uncovered" a program funded by the federal government to "make animals trans."  last night, on the house floor, she claimed to have been drugged-and-raped by her former fiancé and three other men who were part of a pornography ring.  this was done seemingly out of the blue (there are no current pieces of legislation that she was obviously referencing here), and drew condemnation, including from the attorney general of south carolina, who pointed out that mace had never brought these charges to his office, and there was no ongoing investigation against any of the men that mace showed (publicly) on the floor of the us congress.there's a couple of things i want to talk about here.  first, i think it's worth noting that mace did this on the floor of the us house, not just because it is a foundational bed of a (currently teetering) democracy, but also because it likely makes what she did protected under the first amendment in a way it would not be for an average american.  members of congress are given wide latitude under the constitution in what is called the "speech and debate clause" to be able to speak without punishment.  the exact wording is "for any speech or debate in either house, members shall not be questioned in any other place," the latter referring for all intents and purposes to a courtroom.  there have been nicks in the armor of this through the years, specifically hutchinson v. proxmire in 1979 where senator william proxmire (d-wi) was sued for defamation, and the case went forward because proxmire made statements against mr. hutchinson outside of his congressional role (the case was settled out of court), but largely it has remained intact.  i note this because had mace made these claims in, say, an interview on fox news it is almost certain that she would be opening herself up for a lawsuit from these four men...doing it in congress probably means she can't be punished by anyone other than her fellow members of congress.secondly, this is really disturbing behavior from anyone, but especially from someone with as much influence over us policy as mace.  i am going to point out that this is my opinion (mace seems to be weirdly good at finding things people say about her on the internet, and i want to be clear this is just my read on the situation, and will throw in this is just alleged for that reason), but she seems to be genuinely going through a public breakdown.  her behavior is erratic, frequently feeling like she is lying for attention, and that she seems to be going through some sort of mental health issue in real-time in front of the nation.  i don't condone what she's done in the past few months, particularly her bigoted attacks on transgender people, but there is obviously something wrong here.  mace posted on social media in 2023 that she had two sisters and a brother whom she is close with...i genuinely (no sarcasm whatsoever) hope that one of them is trying to help her because this is someone who needs help.but it is also a testament to the modern republican party that this is happening without any sort of public reckoning.  twenty years ago, if someone did what mace has done the past few weeks, they would've been asked to resign from congress from pretty much all sides.  rep. joe wilson yelled "you lie" during a state of the union address and it was a major headline for months...that wouldn't even survive an hour-long news cycle today.  mace feels different to me because it feels (in my opinion) like a call for help from someone who is struggling & trying to get people to notice any way that she can, but against figures like donald trump, byron donalds, marjorie taylor greene, matt gaetz, & lauren boebert, it's hard to tell.  the modern media infrastructure rewards people with more headlines if they say cruel, dangerous, or wacky things, and the modern republican party's base loves this, seemingly gloating at how this insane, bizarre behavior is "owning the libs."  some have said that mace's posturing is simply her trying to get a leg-up in next year's gubernatorial and senate races in south carolina, and maybe that's truly the case.  we are officially in a world where it's not apparent if a sitting member of congress is having a mental breakdown or if she's just trying to act crazy to help her in a primary...because for republicans in 2025, these things look so similar it's hard to tell the difference.

thoughts on the week's news: michigan senate, trump nominations, & emilia perez





it's been a long week, and so i'm treating myself to a little article today, talking about three major moments in the news that have been dominating my mind.  let's talk through it, shall we?sen. gary peters (d-mi)1. gary peters retires from the senatethe biggest electoral news of the week came in one of the country's most important swing states.  after two terms in office, sen. gary peters is retiring next year and foregoing a third.  while it shouldn't be news that a 66-year-old man is retiring, in the senate this barely counts as middle age (peters is the 47th oldest member of the senate to give you some perspective).the goal today is going to be for me to give opinions, not necessarily a full lesson on each of these, so i'm going to state a few opinions as facts right now to get it out of the way.  i think that peters retiring is a good thing.  2026 is likely going to be a good year for the democrats, and we do, in fact, need to replace our aging senators with younger people so that, for example, if 2032 is a tougher cycle, we have incumbents who can win seats that we might've lost in open seat elections (jacky rosen & tammy baldwin probably saved us two seats in 2024 because they were established quantities and newcomers).  this is a good cycle for peters to retire, and i hope other aging democrats like dick durbin, jeanne shaheen, & jack reed follow his lead later this cycle.  i know some people like to take retirements as tea leaves of where the senate is expected to land in 2026 (i.e. peters doesn't think dems will win a majority), but i'm more practical about these things, and getting senators a couple decades younger is a good investment for our party's future.in terms of who should run to replace him, my first and last thought was initially gretchen whitmer.  whitmer is a superstar, currently the person i most want to be our nominee in 2028, and i would love to see her in the senate.  but she likely won't run because why run for the senate when you clearly want to run for potus, and so we're left with a plan b (she has already declined and i doubt she changes her mind).  most democrats focused on former transportation secretary (and 2020 presidential hopeful) pete buttigieg.  buttigieg moved to michigan a couple of years ago, and would be a moron not to run.  buttigieg, like whitmer, is certainly eying a 2028 presidential run as well, but he is also a decade younger than her, and has much less experience (his only electoral achievement is as a mayor of a small town...she's the wildly popular governor of one of the nation's most important swing states).  buttigieg needs to prove that he can win a major office like the us senate in order to be seen as a serious contender for the white house outside of dupont circle, and his aura won't last forever as an out-of-work politician.  he needs to make this move soon-he should run.as a democrat, though, my final thought is-i don't know if he is the right choice for our nominee.  buttigieg has shown little appeal outside of a core democratic constituency (namely, college-educated, affluent white voters, a coalition we don't have any trouble with), and while a campaign could show he does, i do think democrats shouldn't coalesce around him without knowing if he can actually win a campaign.  state sen. mallory mcmorrow, for example, has also shown herself to be an impressive future star in the democratic party that is in search of a higher office.  her appeal feels broader than buttigieg's to me, and ultimately the most important thing here is winning the seat (neither of these candidates' future presidential ambitions are worth more than that).  i personally think mcmorrow might end up being the better candidate, but i hope both run (and honestly, i kind of hope no one else serious does because otherwise this just becomes the buttigieg show), so we can find out.hhs secretary nominee robert kennedy, jr.2. trump confirmations move throughone thing you will absolutely not hear from me in the coming years is discussions about the policies of the trump administration.  quite frankly, i'm only checking in when i think i can make a difference.  the outrage cycles are going to exhaust us all...my focus is on 2026, 2028, and helping the people that i can through other actions (and holding my congressional delegation to task if they look like they're going off-track, which i doubt as they're all progressive democrats).  but america made its bed, it deserves to suffer for a bit in my personal estimation.but what i want to mention here is the electoral impact of the confirmations.  matt gaetz is obviously no longer in contention to lead the justice department, and tulsi gabbard's nomination weirdly seems the most in trouble so far (which honestly i did not predict given gabbard is a relatively good public speaker and a former member of congress...i figured that would give her some ability to grease the wheels on her own behalf).  but pete hegseth has now been confirmed, and it looks like republicans will get kash patel and robert f. kennedy, jr. through at the rate.  the only republicans who have indicated they might stray from these three (and we don't know if this will be uniform) are susan collins, lisa murkowski, and mitch mcconnell, and thanks to bob casey's loss last year, they're not enough.which brings me to thom tillis.  with the exception of susan collins (who is her own unique unicorn of electoral calculation), tillis is the only republican senator from a swing state that is up in 2026.  he is also expected to face a very good candidate (former gov. roy cooper) in the general election.  yet his actions of being the deciding vote on hegseth, and leading the charge on patel (and so far indicating he is in favor of rfk jr. leading hhs) are the actions of a man worrying about a primary more than a general election, and i'm going to be honest-that's a bad strategy.  kennedy and hegseth are not just unqualified & hold unpopular beliefs...they're also incompetent.  you can practically smell the future scandals about to erupt here, and while trump might not pay a price for this, tillis will.  these are the rare congressional votes that will matter, and i'll go so far as to say this-if tillis backs kennedy at the end of the day, i think he's the underdog next year to hold the seat.karla sofia gascon in emilia perez3. emilia perez oscar chanceswe're shifting gears away from politics into the movies, and specifically the oscar chances of one emilia perez.  i have not been shy on social media or letterboxd about how i think this is a truly terrible film, but with 13 nominations, it was hard until about 72 hours ago to argue it had become the nominal frontrunner for best picture of 2024.  when you make oscar predictions, you need to check your own taste at the door.  in fact, a few days ago, leading oscar site nextbestpicture's pundits had emilia perez favored for five wins: best picture, film editing, supporting actress, international feature, and original song.but then the shit hit the fan.  an already polarizing film added to its count a director making xenophobic comments; jacques audiard talked about how spanish was the "language of the poor and migrants."  this looks like small potatoes compared to what leaked about the nominated lead of the film karla sofia gascon, who has years (though up to the shockingly recent present given how long netflix has been pimping this movie) of racist, violent, and cruel social media tweets, attacking everyone from muslims to the chinese to oscar-winning singer adele.  gascon has now become toxic (it's hard, in retrospect, to imagine why this didn't leak earlier given that oscar favorites nicole kidman, angelina jolie, kate winslet, & amy adams were all in the running but got ignored by someone who is now virtually unemployable in hollywood...ampas could've saved itself a lot of trouble by just thinking inside the box).  there was talk about having each of the nominees introduced by former winners, but i doubt any publicist is willing to go there for their clients (somewhere conan o'brien is nervously wondering why he didn't let jimmy kimmel go again).here's the reality though-the nominations are set.  the oscars have rescinded nominations in the past, but that was over breaking of academy rules, which neither audiard or gascon have done.  anyone telling you that they might lose their nominations is not aware of academy history (or of oscar winners roman polanski, harvey weinstein, & mel gibson).  but what it could do is lose awards it was expected to win.  best picture & editing, for example, it was only nominally leading at nbp, and i would imagine in the coming days the film will fall out of grace in both categories to films like the brutalist and conclave (some will quickly want to say that the brutalist also has controversies, but honestly...the only controversy i see mattering this year is the one for emilia perez because it's very understandable, enough so that the public cares & oscar doesn't want to be seen rooting for it).the other three it is the decided frontrunner.  international feature film at least has an obvious second place (the surprise best picture nominee i'm still here), but song and supporting actress it's harder to find a way to avoid an emilia perez win.  best original song emilia perez has two nominations, so vote-splitting is theoretically possible, but none of the other nominees are obvious winners to compete with a best picture-nominated musical.  this would honestly be the perfect time to give the statue to diane warren, who has never won a competitive academy award, but will enough of the academy get the memo?  in supporting actress you have ariana grande in second, but as a pop star they probably will make her pay some dues first (lady gaga and cher also didn't win on their first acting nominations), and neither felicity jones nor monica barbaro have the sort of work that gets you a win.  honestly, isabella rossellini would be intriguing (best picture frontrunner(?), well-liked film, longtime movie star who has never won, generally beloved as a celebrity, old hollywood glamour) if she could pull it off.  if she was in second place instead of grande, i'd think zoe saldana was in more trouble...but i currently don't see a shut-out on the horizon for the combusting emilia perez

the state of the senate





senators jon tester (d-mt) and sherrod brown (d-oh)we are finishing up my time back at the blog with one more time capsule article.  i will not be writing on the blog regularly, other than i think i might still do a single article when i finish a my ballot or ovp which will be once a month, or if i feel i need to pipe in, so we'll go quiet again, though as has been indicated by the past week, i don't think i've finished with this completely (just that it'll never go back to being daily).  we're going to finish up this return with one last annual article.it's become something of a tradition on the blog for me to posit a "way too early" state of the senate here, guessing what the closest races for the next federal election will be two years ahead of time.  or, one wonders if it's too early, to be honest, as we find below.  i've listed first what i initially predicted in january of 2023, and then what actually happened in november of 2024 in terms of the races "most likely to flip."  as you can see from the rankings, the four seats that actually flipped are listed #1-4 in the latter last.here's what i predicted:1. west virginia2. ohio3. montana4. arizona5. nevada6. wisconsin7. michigan8. pennsylvania9. texas10. virginiaand here's what actually happened:1. west virginia2. montana3. ohio4. pennsylvania5. michigan6. wisconsin7. nevada8. arizona9. nebraska10. texasas you can see, i did staggeringly well here, getting 9/10 of the races correct.  the only race that i missed was nebraska, which was a genuine shock.  though dan osborn came closer than expected, sen. deb fischer (r-ne) still won by an embarrassing margin.  otherwise, this is exactly right.  my biggest mistake inside the rankings was pennsylvania, where i thought bob casey would be stronger than he was (side note: i didn't write a post election article both because i'm not doing things like that on the blog anymore, and also because i was kind of numb afterward, though not in the same way that i was in 2016 because i had a lot more going on in my life at that point, but i will say that of all of the congressional races, bob casey losing felt like a sucker punch & will go down with missouri 2018 and north carolina 2014 as one of those senate races i'll probably never get over).  honestly, especially considering virginia was #11 on this list, i feel really proud of myself over how well i did, though man did i wish i'd been a little wronger on some of these races (i do think that the senate majority math is tricky to the point where i don't know how we get a majority before 2028, maybe even 2030, with the losses of casey & brown).looking ahead, history teaches us that trump will probably be unpopular in his midterm (second term presidents usually have bloody second midterms...i doubt trump will be an exception), so the below is predicated in at least some part on the races being left-leaning.  with the increasing lack of crossover voters, though, outside of the big 7 swing states (all of whom went for trump last year, and most of whom have democratic senators already), i do think the democrats will need 1-2 "nebraska 2024" style races to be able to go into november 2026 with a straight face saying "we can take back the majority."  with that said, let's dive into this field.honorable mention: kamala harris saw a significant decline in support in both new jersey & new mexico in 2024, and we don't know if that was unique to harris (i.e. the democrats will bounce back to biden-level numbers) or if this is a canary in the coal mine of these states becoming more competitive as we move further into the 2020's.  i expect both sens. booker & lujan to run for reelection, which should help them, but i would keep an eye on those races.  same with sen. jack reed, who will surely win if he runs again, but an open race in rhode island (where harris lost 7-points off of biden's margin) could portend a threat for the top 10 if reed retires, even if i don't think it's actually flippable.  if the trump administration is wildly unpopular in 2026, states like iowa & kansas could be in contention, though i do wonder if there's any hope of democrats attracting a quality recruit to take advantage of a bad environment in those states, since any good candidate will likely favor a run for governor.sen. jon husted (r-oh)10. ohiothe ohio senate race officially gots its incumbent this past-week as gov. mike dewine (r) buckled under pressure from donald trump to replace jd vance not with his favored choice (trump allegedly wanted vivek ramaswamy), but instead dewine loyalist lt. gov. jon husted got the nod.  this is a race where, like iowa & kansas, my expectation is that we'll have more heat in the governor's race (dewine must step down, and already ramaswamy is running there) than here in terms of quality democratic candidate recruitment.  already sen. sherrod brown, rep. tim ryan, & supreme court justice jennifer brunner are being rumored for both contests, though it's an indictment of how bad things have been for the ohio democrats that all three of these candidates lost their last (very high profile) races.  if redistricting hurts rep. emilia sykes, she could also be in the running (i would assume a much redder map for ohio's congressional delegation in 2026 given the ballot initiative that would've outlawed gerrymandering there didn't pass last year), but unless husted faces a primary challenge (a real possibility) i don't see a world where he actually loses...just that it could get close if things are bad for trump.sen. jeanne shaheen (d-nh)9. new hampshirethis race will go higher on this list if we see a retirement from sen. jeanne shaheen (which i anticipate we will given shaheen will be 78 next week).  this was yet another state that kamala harris royally dropped the ball compared to biden in 2020, winning it by less than 3-points, so it's another state we're trying to figure out if harris hit the low point for democrats, or if this is another state shifting right.  an open seat contest could attract some serious contenders on both sides, including gov. chris sununu for the republicans and democratic rep. chris pappas on the left.  former sen. scott brown (r) has also made waves about running, and it's hard to imagine pappas would get the field totally to himself given there's room to run to his left here (if i were maggie goodlander, i'd seriously consider trying to jump ahead of him in line given his recent vote on transgender rights).  but the big question is around shaheen-if she runs again, i would assume this stays off of republicans' radars as they have bigger fish to fry.sen. tina smith (d-mn)8. minnesotathough a decade younger than shaheen, sen. tina smith is also on retirement watch, and has not yet committed to running for a second full-term in 2026.  smith would be a pretty safe option for reelection, especially in a trump midterm, even though she is significantly more progressive than her state (with the loss of sherrod brown, smith might be the most "left-of-her-state" senator in the democratic caucus).  if smith steps down, though, i think we'd have a free-for-all.  there's a real possibility that the dfl would go with a polarizing figure like al franken or keith ellison rather than someone safe like angie craig, and the republicans have higher-quality candidates like pete stauber or (if he realizes he'll never be speaker) tom emmer that could beat franken or ellison if the dfl is foolish enough to go that route (and as a minnesotan, i could see us making that mistake).  but, like new hampshire, this is all predicated on smith retiring...which i'm 50/50 on if she will.gov. glenn youngkin (r-va)7. virginiaanother spot where i'm waiting for a retirement, as sen. mark warner (currently age 70) is not someone that i expected to become a dianne feinstein/chuck grassley style figure that never retires (he's spent too many times flirting about running for governor again, and he's also insanely rich & has the mentality of someone who might want to try something else).  if he leaves, the virginia gop, which has had a decent past few years (kamala harris only won by 5-points after biden won by 10-points, a pretty steep drop), has a great candidate in gov. glenn youngkin, who is term-limited and will be out of office by next year (and with jd vance now in the naval observatory), he's unlikely to ever get a shot at the white house, which was his dream.  given how much he seems to love politics, i would assume he runs.  the democrats are running their best candidate right now for governor in abigail spanberger, and while they have a bench (reps. eugene vindman & jennifer mcclellan both come to mind), i'll be honest-it doesn't feel strong enough not to worry about youngkin running here.  hence why one of kirsten gillibrand's first jobs as dscc chair is to get mark warner to run again.rep. mary peltola (d-ak)6. alaskawe shift away from the groups of theoretical retirements to a race that is largely predicated on one person, and it isn't incumbent sen. dan sullivan, who is widely-expected to pursue a third term.  it's instead former rep. mary peltola, who lost a very close race for reelection last year, and has hinted that she's not done yet with electoral politics.  peltola may go for her old job, or she may go for governor (it would certainly be the easier path given that alaska gov. mike dunleavy is term-limited and gubernatorial races are an easier lift if you're from the non-dominant party).  peltola has already filed federal paperwork (i.e. she says, on paper, she's running for her old house seat), and that money can't transfer between a house and a governor's race.  it can transfer to a senate race, however.  and one wonders if peltola, if she's going to go for broke, will actually go for a six-year term where she'd be afforded considerably more power (she'd quickly have the kind of position that joe manchin had when he was in office given how much more reliant chuck schumer was on her than the other way around).  but sullivan is more popular than any republican she's faced to date...will she want to risk it on what will be her only real shot at a comeback?rep. ronny jackson (r-tx)5. texassen. john cornyn is 72-years-old, and just lost his dream job (senate majority leader).  senators frequently come up with a plan b, and he might just be content finishing his career as a backbencher, but it's not just retirement that cornyn has to fear.  rep. ronny jackson and attorney general ken paxton, both polarizing in a general election but very popular with the maga base, are considering runs for this seat, and it's doubtful that cornyn could rely upon president trump against jackson specifically, given his position as trump's former chief medical advisor.  democrats, especially after the work they put into texas in 2024, are exhausted by the "lucy-and-the-football" routine in the state, but if they care about a majority in 2026, and not just setting themselves up for a majority in 2028 or 2030, they have to actually win states that trump won in 2020 like texas & alaska.  i won't postulate who might be a good candidate here (because after so many tries with such a variety of candidates, we still don't know the democrat who can break texas), but they have to try here, especially if it's against paxton/jackson, because that's a genuinely winnable race.rep. john james (r-mi)4. michigansen. gary peters barely won reelection five years ago against (now-) rep. john james, and the same can be said for senator elissa slotkin last year.  michigan races can be close and not always winning for democrats (just ask kamala harris), and peters will be in for a fight.  the big question is who the republicans will put up against peters.  most of the high-profile republicans in the state (rep. james, attorney general mike cox, senate minority leader aric nesbitt, ambassador pete hoekstra) are looking at the gubernatorial race), but my gut says that one of them would break and go after peters even if the governor's race (after eight years of the now term-limited gretchen whitmer) is open.  honestly...though he's something of a joke on election twitter, i have to say it-the best candidate is probably james going for a third time, and part of me wonders if he's the one to switch gears here given he already has federal experience.  personally, i'd love to see peters & whitmer switch races, given whitmer is (in my opinion) the single most effective politician the democrats have right now and it'd be a waste to keep her out of office headed into 2028, but i doubt that happens.  either way, this race will be one of the most-discussed of 2026...sen. jon ossoff (d-ga)3. georgia...but not the most-discussed.  that will be the georgia senate race.  sen. jon ossoff pulled off a massive upset in 2021 to win this seat, getting the democrats the senate majority.  despite his celebrity as a poor candidate (who lost the then-most expensive house race of all-time that many thought would be the end of his career) he has been an impressive first-termer, and has done a good job acclimating to incumbency.  ossoff is expected to face gov. brian kemp, the outgoing governor whose general election bonafides are secure given donald trump hates him (but he's still somehow popular).  early polling shows kemp leading, but i'll be honest-that's kind of worthless right now.  two years of trump will make kemp's fortunes even if the governor isn't closely-tied to the president, and ossoff will be in a better position by then.  there's also the real possibility the republicans blow the race by not backing kemp in the primary.  the most vocal name in the race is rep. buddy carter, who has already spoken out that he may run, but the biggest name is rep. marjorie taylor greene, who has not tamped down chatter that she is pursuing a promotion.  if greene is the republican nominee, ossoff will win this race relatively easily, but against kemp it'll be a race.  for all of the talk about raphael warnock for 2028, i'll be honest-i think people are sleeping on the potential of ossoff being on the 2028 ticket at this point if he wins this race.gov. roy cooper (d-nc)2. north carolinaif kamala harris had won the 2024 election, georgia would've been the #1 race on this list.  i am assuming, though, that donald trump gets some blowback by 2026 (particularly given his economic policies are putting a recession very much on the table), and so i'm instead moving two republican races onto the top 2.  the democrats have no shot at the majority without these two; their quest for a majority is slim even with them, but these are must wins.  that's why i assume that kirsten gillibrand is already working the phones with gov. roy cooper here.  despite his age (cooper is 67), the former governor is the best option the democrats have here, and he seems interested in running for the senate seat after basically having to turn down vp consideration last year when he did appear to be interested.  sen. thom tillis could face a primary challenge (former rnc chair and presidential daughter-in-law lara trump has openly talked about it, and given tillis may not back all of trump's cabinet nominees, he could be vulnerable on that front), but i think we're looking at the other marquee race of 2026 here, with tillis vs. cooper, a contest that even in january 2025 you can safely say is a tossup next year.sen. susan collins (r-me)1. mainedon't look at me like that.  i'm aware that trying to beat susan collins in maine is a lot like trying to achieve blue texas-it looks like a possibility every six years, but never happens.  but collins has never faced an election like this.  this is the first gop presidential midterm that collins has run in since 2002, which was very different given george w. bush's approvals were much higher than trump's are expected to be next year.  in 2020, when the democrats went after her, collins was able to separate herself from trump by literally having trump on the ballot next to her-"vote for biden, and then vote for me" was a strategy i didn't expect to work, but it did.  if maine voters (who backed kamala harris last year) want to send a message to trump next year, the only way to do so is by voting against collins.  i expect collins, who is famously indecisive, to resist retirement until the last minute, but given her perfect track record in maine, i also suspect she'd rather retire than go for another six years & risk going out like her hero margaret chase smith (who lost her last race).  rep. jared golden & secretary of state shenna bellows are probably the democrats two best options, though both are currently favoring the gubernatorial race.  if collins is out or vulnerable, though, i would imagine one of them gets into the contest.

2024 oscar predictions





the oscars have moved their nominations date multiple times now, but as of today they're currently to be announced on january 23rd.  regardless, i feel like i have enough information right now to make it official-here are my predictions of what i think will be nominated for this year's academy awards.  enjoy and sound off in the comments!picture1. conclave2. the brutalist3. emilia perez4. wicked5. a complete unknown6. anora7. dune: part two8. the substance9. sing sing10. a real painalts: nickel boys, all that we imagine as lightthe lowdown: the first 8 don't feel movable to me.  the substance is certainly a weird best picture nominee, but the academy has become far less stodgy about such things in recent years (and more prone to group think, and the substance has dominated precursors).  the final two slots really feel between the four listed films (september 5 feels too late-breaking, challengers too hip, and the seed of the sacred fig too quiet).  i'm going with sing sing because it's a best actor lock and a real pain because it's a movie that i think most actors will like, though nickel boys, in particular has ardent fans & i wouldn't be surprised if it made it.director1. brady corbet (the brutalist)2. jacques audiard (emilia perez)3. coralie fargeat (the substance)4. edward berger (conclave)5. sean baker (anora)alts: ramell ross (nickel boys), denis villeneuve (dune 2), james mangold (a complete unknown)the lowdown: the dga gave their list to corbet, audiard, berger, baker & mangold, but if your oscar knowledge goes back to before 2008, you know that the dga is not always carbon copy for this category, and indeed, it was historically a better marker for which five films would make best picture as the dga is more populist than oscar.  due to this, i'm skipping mangold, and putting in coralie fargeat, both because this would be a more daring choice (in line with the directors branch), and because there has been more openness in recent years to ensuring there's a female directing nominee.  if i'm underestimating nickel boys, this would be a decent place to put ramell ross, and denis villeneuve is always a threat (though oscar has a tepid relationship with him), but fargeat makes the most overall sense.actor1. adrien brody (the brutalist)2. timothee chalamet (a complete unknown)3. ralph fiennes (conclave)4. colman domingo (sing sing)5. daniel craig (queer)alts: sebastian stan (the apprentice or a different man)the lowdown: daniel craig presents the biggest conundrum here.  the first four nominees feel fairly locked, with the top 3 each feeling like theoretical winners (if there's a shock snub with oscar, it'd be domingo missing due to oscar's collective amnesia about any films made before labor day, but i doubt it).  craig got both the globes & sag, but somehow missed with bafta, instead with them preferring stan (in this case playing donald trump in the apprentice), as well as hugh grant's lauded turn in heretic.  i think at the end of the day it's still craig-grant is in a genre they don't historically like (and they're already doing the substance), and stan is splitting votes with himself, while craig is a longtime movie star who has never gotten an oscar nomination (they love citing those).  but that fifth slot still feels in play.actress1. demi moore (the substance)2. cynthia erivo (wicked)3. mikey madison (anora)4. karla sofia gascon (emilia perez)5. marianne jean-baptiste (hard truths)alts: fernanda torres (i'm still here), pamela anderson (the last showgirl)the lowdown: unlike best actor, i don't think the top 4 is locked in here.  moore feels pretty assured (and probably is going to win the oscar), but madison's film peaked too early, erivo's been more lauded than her costars, and gascon's turn has a lot of detractors.  the main reason i have more confidence in domingo holding it together than these four is because there's way more competition here.  you have not just two critical darlings (torres & jean-baptiste), but also a comeback bid (if demi moore wasn't in the running here, i'd guess anderson makes it but their similar narratives makes it feel like moore is sucking all of the "glad to see her again" energy here).  you also have a lot of oscar favorites (nicole kidman, kate winslet, angelina jolie, & amy adams) who all have gotten citations this season and could make it like annette bening did last year for nyad.  i'm going with jean-baptiste because i need at least one no globe/no sag prediction and she's peaking at the right time, but the fifth slot is so crowded that no one except demi moore should feel comfortable right now.supporting actor1. kieran culkin (a real pain)2. edward norton (a complete unknown)3. guy pearce (the brutalist)4. yura borisov (anora)5. jeremy strong (the apprentice)alts: stanley tucci (conclave), denzel washington (gladiator ii), jonathan bailey (wicked)the lowdown: another category with a lot of names, and the category i most think something wild is going to happen in on oscar morning.  culkin is so locked in as the season frontrunner that the rest of the nominees are mostly rearranging chairs, and that's when weird things happen.  i'm going with norton & pearce because those turns are very oscar-adjacent, and borisov has dominated all season even as a relative unknown.  strong is really well-respected by actors (he's getting nominated at some point), but so are tucci & especially washington, the latter of whom basically always makes it when he has awards heat.  they could just toss their hands in the air and pick something crazy like jonathan bailey, everyone's collective crush at the moment...i expect a weird name here, but i'll own that i'm picking a pretty conventional quintet to play it safe.supporting actress1. zoe saldana (emilia perez)2. arian grande (wicked)3. felicity jones (the brutalist)4. jamie lee curtis (the last showgirl)5. isabella rossellini (conclave)alts: margaret qualley (the substance), monica barbaro (a complete unknown)the lowdown: the first two nominees feel set, and then we get crazy here too.  jones, after seeing the film, is the kind of role that oscar goes for, and i feel increasingly confident in jamie lee curtis-the bafta & sag nods, plus an overall sense that the last showgirl is playing well with voters makes me assume an afterglow nomination is in the cards.  i'm going with rossellini for fifth because (similar to daniel craig above) she's a longtime movie star who has never been nominated, and it's generally a good bet to make that the one woman in a best picture frontrunner dominated by men will get nominated (see also felicity jones).  margaret qualley could make it if they love the substance, monica barbaro could make it if they love a complete unknown, selena gomez could make it if they extra love emilia perez, and there's always the chance of a late-breaker like aunjanue ellis-taylor (if you can't tell, i have no sense of the standing of nickel boys, which i'm hoping to see later today)...but the top 5 here feels very much like an oscar-y lineup to me, and so that's where i'm landing.adapted screenplay1. conclave2. emilia perez3. sing sing4. nickel boys5. a complete unknownalts: dune: part two, wickedthe lowdown: as we move into the techs, i'll say it-i either have a bad sense of this year because it's genuinely competitive (which i think it is, at least for the nominations) or a lot of my oscar-related tools (twitter, my blog, entertainment weekly) have gone the way of the dodo or, in twitter's case, become a giant dumpster fire.  so i anticipate i'll get more wrong beyond this category.  for example, i can't quite tell if dune 2 or wicked have the kind of stamina to take out a movie like nickel boys or sing sing or a complete unknown, all of which are also in the best picture hunt.  dune and wicked are in genres (scifi and musicals) that do poorly here (particularly compared to biopics about nobel laureates and adaptations of pulitzer prize winners), but if one of them has more strength than expected, i could see it getting in...i just don't know over whom.original screenplay1. the brutalist2. anora3. the substance4. a real pain5. hard truthsalts: september 5, challengers, all we imagine as lightthe lowdown: best picture is overrun with adaptations, so we know at least a few nominees will miss there.  i'm listing the four predicted best picture contenders as #1-4 (which means jesse eisenberg will join the short list of actors who have also been cited for writing), and then for the fifth choice i'm going with mike leigh, who has received five nominations to date for writing (along with two for directing), and at 81 is not going to have many chances to show up here again.  september 5, all we imagine as light, and challengers are in movies with arguably more heat (certainly for best picture), but leigh's long history with the academy makes me think he's the best bet in a tight contest.international feature film1. emilia perez (france)2. the seed of the sacred fig (germany)3. i'm still here (brazil)4. kneecap (ireland)5. vermiglio (italy)alts: flow (latvia), girl with the needle (denmark)the lowdown: this is one of those races where the eventual winner is so firmly established (this, along with song & supporting actress, is the category that emilia perez is pretty much guaranteed a win in), so the rest of the nominees are more of a "who's getting #2?" contest.  i included i'm still here with torres in the hunt for best actress (similar to her mother 26 years ago, she could get cited for best actress for a foreign language film nominee that won't win), and after seeing the seed of the sacred fig, i don't buy the "waning interest" in the film that some have posited online as the big shock snub on thursday (it's too good if you actually see it to ignore it).  the remaining four films feel like it'll be between ireland, italy, latvia, & denmark, though this category tends to love to throw in at least one movie no one has been predicting at all, so don't be surprised if at least one nominee isn't listed above.animated feature film1. the wild robot2. flow3. inside out 24. wallace & gromit: vengeance most fowl5. memoir of a snailalts: moana 2the lowdown: it has become increasingly easy, especially with disney ceding so much ground, to predict this category, making it downright dull if you're like me and dream of the days where the secret of kells could be the shock of the morning (i still maintain that it should only be three-wide...that would make it far more interesting).  as it sits, the only movie i could see making it in a surprise would be moana 2, which just crossed $1 billion and you'd think on some level that would entice people to give disney two slots.  but that's honestly it-this wasn't a very intriguing year for animation beyond these five pictures.original score1. the brutalist2. conclave3. emilia perez4. the wild robot5. challengersalts: wicked, blitz, the room next doorthe lowdown: the most insular branch in the academy, the biggest concern i have right now is that i'm not picking a lot of longtime oscar favorites save for reznor & ross (in fifth place).  8-time nominee stephen schwartz (wicked), 12-time nominee hans zimmer (blitz), and 4-time nominee alberto iglesias (the room next door) are very much oscar's speed, and i think one of them feels likelier than not to make it into the final nominees, but none stands out.  wicked has the curse of musicals not being super popular to be nominated here (and they're already breaking that rule with emilia perez), and the other two might be their films only nominations.  hell, i wouldn't even be surprised if 4-time nominee danny elfman (who hasn't been up for an oscar in 16 years) is the shocker for the beetlejuice sequel.original song1. "el mal" (emilia perez)2. "mi camino" (emilia perez)3. "kiss the sky" (the wild robot)4. "the journey" (the six triple eight)5. "harper and will go west" (will & harper)alts: "compress/repress" (challengers), "piece by piece" (piece by piece)the lowdown: there are honestly a lot of oscar bridesmaids that made the shortlist this year.  lin-manuel miranda (mufasa), diane warren (the six triple eight), pharrell williams (piece by piece), and nicholas britell (also mufasa) have spots on the shortlist and none of them have won despite multiple nominations, and one wonders if i'm under-estimating them by only picking the inevitable warren for my top 5.  that said, it's hard to see anyone other than emilia perez winning here (making including bridesmaids pointless since they ain't going to win this time either), and so i'm going with the tried-and-true best song tropes of an animated film, a diane warren film, & a documentary to finish this off aside from the emilia perez frontrunners.  now the question is-will selena gomez & zoe saldana perform them live?sound1. wicked2. dune: part two3. emilia perez4. a complete unknown5. gladiator iialts: alien romulus, the wild robotthe lowdown: with the devastating fires impacting los angeles over the past week, the sound, makeup, & visual effects bakeoffs have been cancelled, and while they are trying to do a proxy version of this online, i do wonder if this ends up favoring movies that are more top-of-mind (i.e. the best picture contenders) rather than movies that might've gained some cache from these presentations.  alien: romulus, specifically, felt like a movie that i assumed would make it until the bakeoffs were cancelled, and so instead i'm subbing in gladiator ii for that spot.  this category is weirdly dominated by musicals, which may make dune's path to a victory considerably easier.cinematography1. the brutalist2. dune: part two3. nickel boys4. conclave5. nosferatualts: maria, a complete unknown, wickedthe lowdown: the asc had seven nominees this year, which thus provided virtually no help.  a complete unknown got into the list, as did maria, both of which i have kept as alternates because the former feels pretty generic (though they love phedon papamichael in this category) and the latter has no heat anywhere (though edward lachman is an oscar favorite as well...this is a category so clique-y you have to go back to the early 1930's before you can find a lineup that didn't feature a previous nominee).  the biggest, scariest threat to this lineup is wicked, the garish & ugly cinematography somehow getting into the relatively classy asc lineup.  i also think it's weird we have no black-and-white options in the running, so don't be stunned if the girl with the needle manages to get in here, even if it misses best international feature.costume1. wicked2. dune: part two3. nosferatu4. maria5. gladiator iialts: beetlejuice beetlejuice, the brutalist, conclavethe lowdown: we once again have a lineup where we have a longtime oscar favorite (colleen atwood, winner of 4 oscars & 12 nominations) in a movie that's not super hot elsewhere (beetlejuice beetlejuice).  the oscars historically would've gone here, particularly given the film's gross, but i think they've become so "best picture or bust" in recent years that i'm keeping atwood out even if i think she's a legit threat.  this assembles a relatively predictable group of fantasy & period pieces for the nominees.  i'm weirdly less concerned about choosing maria (this category loves this style of nominee, and doesn't really give a damn about box office), and more concerned i'm nominating too many sequels.  c'est la vie.film editing1. conclave2. emilia perez3. dune: part two4. the brutalist5. the substancealts: wicked, challengersthe lowdown: the key to best film editing is to have a very strong sense of what the "core five" best pictures are, and pick most of them.  i think if we were still in the 5-wide best picture nominees we'd have conclave, emilia perez, the brutalist, a complete unknown, and wicked as the nominees, and i'm going with three of them (plus wicked as an also-ran).  i'm keeping dune in because they love best picture nominees with an action bent in editing, and i'm also keeping the substance because if you like it, you like it because of the editing.  challengers is the weird film with a lot of heat here and not a lot in best picture, so i don't know what to make of that but i am listing it to cover my bases.makeup & hairstyling1. wicked2. the substance3. nosferatu4. beetlejuice beetlejuice5. emilia perezalts: a different man, waltzing with brandothe lowdown: our second lineup impacted by a lack of the bakeoffs, and here i think that is going to specifically hurt two films: a different man and waltzing with brando.  a different man is under-seen, certainly compared to box office hits like wicked and beetlejuice, which may make a difference if the branch isn't doing their homework, while brando's inclusion on the shortlist at all would've normally been a sign that this will get in (the makeup branch loves giving "oscar-nominated" to truly bizarre and oftentimes terrible movies...they are definitely that cousin in the family), but i doubt anyone sees it without the bakeoffs.  i'm therefore going to pick five nominees that i think most of the academy will have seen, and this still feels pretty much in-line with what oscar would normally pick without the wild card contender.production design1. wicked2. the brutalist3. dune: part two4. nosferatu5. gladiator iialts: a complete unknown, beetlejuice beetlejuicethe lowdown: another lineup where i can't quite tell what beetlejuice's strength is (i could honestly see it getting anywhere from 0-4 nominations on thursday), so i'm not predicting it and just going with it as an alternate.  gladiator ii, as well, has lost all heat in what was once assumed to be a sure thing.  the top 3 i feel very confident about given the scale (and in the case of the brutalist, the subject matter), while nosferatu is catnip for this category.  the retro designs of new york city and the large-scale concert venues in a complete unknown would make this a good coattails spot if the film is as strong with oscar as it has been with the precursors.visual effects1. dune: part two2. kingdom of the planet of the apes3. wicked4. alien: romulus5. twistersalts: better man, gladiator ii, deadpool & wolverinethe lowdown: our last category impacted by the bakeoffs is causing me to make maybe my boldest snub prediction in this article.  better man is the type of movie that gets nominated for an oscar, and stands out in the bakeoffs.  this branch isn't afraid of nominating flops, but they also have to see the film, and better man has done terribly at the box office.  it's enough of a threat that, even though i have little interest in it, i'm seeing it tomorrow solely because i think it's a contender here, but i do think that we're overestimating its strength even though it has dominated all season as i get the sense that hollywood would just like to move on from this fiasco.  it's worth noting that if better man and gladiator ii make it over alien: romulus & twisters, 80% of this lineup will feature cgi monkeys as part of their nomination (too bad godzilla x kong didn't make the shortlist so we could assume it'd go 5/5...planet of the apes indeed!).
