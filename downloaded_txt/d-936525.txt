 about harping midi 

          harping midi is anï¿½ interactive midi file player for the aspiring
          musician. originally thought as a tool for learning and practicing
          harmonica, it slowly became natural that some other functions could be
          added like interactive piano keyboard, karaoke text display and some
          basic editing functions like transposing, track naming, instrument
          change, note editing, etc. becoming a more general tool but still
          keeping a powerful set of harmonica players related functions. 

for the amateur musician it is the perfect aid for learning to play
          without the need of knowing how to read standard music notation, you
          just look at the bars and read the notes displayed over them in a very
          staff like manner, slow down at will, select a section and loop play,
          watch a piano as the keys are being pressed, etc. 

for the harmonica player the note name can be replaced by the
          tablature of the selected harmonica type (diatonic or chromatic), key
          and tuning (several tunings are included and you can even load your
          own custom tunings), see the normal inhale and blow notes, the bends
          and also the overblows, watch the harmonica layout. you can also print
          the displayed tab for offline practice, you can create a text track
          with the tab and watch it in real time in the lyrics windows, and then
          save it as a text file if you want, and much more.
