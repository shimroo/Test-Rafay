one red paperclip





*this is the original blog post from 2005 that started this whole adventure:*

this might not surprise you, but below is a picture of a paperclip. it is red.

this red paperclip is currently sitting on my desk  next to my computer. i want to trade this paperclip with you for  something bigger or better, maybe a pen, a spoon, or perhaps a boot. 

if you promise to make the trade i will come and visit you, wherever you are, to trade.

hope to trade with you soon! 

kyle 

ps
i'm going to make a continuous chain of 'up  trades' until i get a house. or an island. or a house on an island. you  get the idea.

high quality reference literature





your email address?  oh, no.  please, don't bother to write it down or email it to me.  that'll be far to much effort on both our parts.  i'll simply go to the library and look it up in the national e-mail and fax directory.  it'll save tons of trouble for both of us.
