 wilderness sport fishing with captain warren sellers

captain warren sellers played a significant role in the development of sport fishing tourism in costa rica. in the mid 1970s, when costa rica was still relatively unknown as a fishing destination, warren was hired as a sport fishing captain for bahia pez vela, a new luxurious resort. his experience and knowledge of the local waters helped put costa rica on the map as a premier destination for sport fishing.
after several years of working at bahia pez vela, warren saved enough money to purchase a 22-foot boston whaler. with his friend randy, they started tamarindo’s first sport fishing operation. over time, they built a successful business and helped create a thriving sport fishing industry in tamarindo.
warren’s passion for sport fishing and his dedication to providing top-notch service to his clients helped establish costa rica as a world-renowned fishing destination. today, thousands of anglers come to costa rica each year to fish for marlin, sailfish, tuna, and other species, thanks in large part to pioneers like captain warren sellers.





in 2003, after many years of running a successful sport fishing operation in tamarindo, costa rica, warren decided to pursue new adventures and sold his boat. he embarked on a quest to find the best fishing destinations around the world that were still largely undiscovered, yet provided abundant fishing opportunities. his search led him to remote and pristine locations in costa rica, panama, the galapagos, and tahiti.
today, warren is highly regarded for his expertise in remote wilderness fishing trips. he organizes unforgettable fishing adventures for anglers in some of the world’s most stunning and untouched destinations.
warren’s contributions to the sport fishing community extend beyond his guiding work. he has been featured in several international television shows and sport fishing magazines, and has also contributed to fishing books and guides. one such book is fly patterns by fishing guides, which is available for purchase on amazon.com.

gyotaku fish printing





warren sellers is a skilled gyotaku artist who transforms the fish he catches into vibrant, one-of-a-kind prints. his work captures the intricate details and natural beauty of each fish, preserving the memory of every successful fishing trip in a stunning and artistic way. each piece is not just a record of the catch but a celebration of the connection between nature and art.
gyotaku, the traditional japanese art of fish printing, dates back to the early 1800s. originally used by fishermen to document their best catches, it has evolved into a respected art form. the process involves applying non-toxic ink or paint to the surface of a freshly caught fish and pressing it onto delicate mulberry paper, creating a detailed and lifelike impression. warren honors this tradition while adding his own contemporary twist by incorporating bright colors and modern techniques.
