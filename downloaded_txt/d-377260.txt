00-04 celica buyer's guide


	ahhh, the last generation of toyota celica.  definitely a beauty! this buyer's guide will show you some of our top picks for cool mods you can make to your car.
hoods

our pick:  vis carbon hood - oem style

carbon fiber hoods are some of the most cost-effective modifications one can make.
because it's lightweight, it helps improve both handling and cornering. in fact, these hoods are so light that they're best secured with a set of hood pins. in addition, its intake improves cool airflow into the engine bay, and it retains somewhat-stock like looks so it won't gain the wrong kind of
attention. available through andy's auto sport for reasonable $487.20 a piece.




racing seats

spec d

recaro-style pvc leather racing seats

these are just gorgeous - look at the stitching and sumptuous leather used! spec d's "recaro-style" seats find that sought-after mix of style, performance and comfort that few brands can easily match. reclinable, plush, yet supportive and race-inspired (it allows for a 4-pt. harness). plus, it's reasonably priced too, a hallmark of spec d's product line: $368 a pair via andy's auto sport.




steering wheels

spec d

momo net-style steering wheel

spec d's line of upgrades is oriented towards those who want the feel and look of a top shelf brand but without the excessive price tag. this momo
net-style steering wheel has a stylish three-spoke design and a sporty "rs"
inlay in the center of the wheel. with grippy, perforated leather covering the majority of the outer wheel, the feel of this wheel has to be experienced.
available through andy's auto sport for a reasonable $32 a piece.




cold air intakes

injen

race division series intake system

cold air intakes
are an easy way to improve your engine's power output, add a cool induction noise and decorate your engine bay. the race division series intake from injen,
a leader in performance auto parts, is a cold air intake system for the enthusiast craving mid-range power. the intake tube is strategically placed behind
the front bumper to acquire colder, denser air. although most of the rd series is a one-piece design, several are two-piece designs due to the mass air
flow meters. every rd system is certified or pending by the california air resource board and backed by injen technology's limited lifetime warranty.
available through andy's auto sport for a reasonable $276.91 a piece.




clutch kits

clutchmasters

fx100 street stage 1 clutch system

mild power increases require a proportional increase in clamping strength from the clutch. this fx100 clutch kit is perfect for those who have installed intakes, exhausts, cams and
other light upgrades and want to ensure consistent, positive shifting, and efficient power transfer to the ground. it features only slightly increased
pedal pressure, longer life than stock, and normal clutch feel during engagement and disengagement for a very smooth operation. available through andy's
auto sport for a reasonable $353.70 a piece.




performance exhaust systems

hks

hi-power silent exhaust system

anybody who is familiar to tuning knows hks as one of the best in the business. this top-shelf exhaust system offers a deep, throaty exhaust note that isn't
too loud or obnoxious, yet improves the sensations of acceleration. in addition to improving power and sharpening throttle response, this auto part is quite light too! available through andy's auto sport at a reasonable
$836.83 a piece.




rims

enkei

g5 

the enkei g5's are real head-turners. without a doubt, these have to be some of the coolest-looking    wheels around, with a futuristic 10-spoke design and a tasty lip! not to mention,
these rims are tough! they pass the stringent japanese light alloy standards and
they're lightweight; improving handling and braking performance! available through andy's auto sport for a very reasonable $142.50 a piece.




fenders


extreme dimensions


f-1 fiberglass fenders


www.extremedimensions.com


extreme dimensions offers these trick fiberglass fenders to the avid celica tuner at
a great cost! whether you've recently been in an accident and you need to replace your fenders or you just want to improve your car's performance, this is
a great add-on for you. not only are they lightweight, but their venting design allows for hot air trapped within the wheel well to escape, thereby
improving braking performance. this accessory is also made with new duraflex
technology, which obtains a much higher durability rate than the average fiberglass product, resulting in reduced shipping damages up to 75%. duraflex products feature a black primer finish, high quality mesh grille, hardware kit, and an installation guide to help you install the product. available
through andy's auto sport for a reasonable $143.20 a pair.
