jeff beck talks of morrissey jeff beck talks of morrissey  california chronicle, on line article (26/04/10) interview with jeff beck. he speaks of meeting morrissey at a hotel in la...no regrets over going my own way musically - california chronicleexcerpt:during his career beck has played with rod stewart, eric clapton, david gilmour, stevie wonder, brian may and zz top. in 2009 he guested with morrissey on the song black cloud on his album year of refusal. "i met morrissey in a hotel in los angeles and he put a note under my door saying, 'would you like to play on my album?' that's how things are with me most of the time. i knew his work with the smiths and knew he was iconic. i was also aware he was particular about how he liked to do certain things. that suited me because i'm a bit like that myself."i thought, what have i got to lose? i'm going to play with the great morrissey. it was a real friendly gesture."

alfie by tony bennett what's it all about, alfie?is it just for the moment we live?what's it all about when you sort it out, alfie?are we meant to take more than we giveor are we meant to be kind?and if only fools are kind, alfie,then i guess it's wise to be cruel.and if life belongs only to the strong, alfie,what will you lend on an old golden rule?as sure as i believe there's a heaven above, alfie,i know there's something much more,something even non-believers can believe in.i believe in love, alfie.without true love we just exist, alfie.until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, alfie.when you walk let your heart lead the wayand you'll find love any day, alfie, alfie.

"toledo" burt bacharach & elvis costello all through the night you telephoned i saw the light blinking red beside the cradle but you don't know how far i've gone now i must live with the lie that i made but if i call, i know i won't have to say it you'll hear my voice - something is bound to betray it but do people living in toledo know that their name hasn't traveled very well? and does anybody in ohio dream of that spanish citadel? but it's no use saying that i love you and how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me for if anyone should look into your eyes it's not forgiveness that they're gonna see you hear her voice - "how could you do that?" you hear her voice - "how could you do that?" so i walked outside in the bright sunshine and lovers pass by smiling and joking but they don't know the fool i was why should they care what was lost what was broken? but if i call, i know i won't have to say it you'll hear my voice - something is bound to betray it but do people living in toledo know that their name hasn't traveled very well? and does anybody in ohio dream of that spanish citadel? but it's no use saying that i love you and how that girl really didn't mean a thing to me for if anyone should look into your eyes it's not forgiveness that they're gonna see but do people living in toledo know that their name hasn't traveled very well? and does anybody in ohio dream of that spanish citadel? but we still have florence, alabama we don't have paris, and we don't have romeor new york, or even amsterdamnone of those lonely townswill be my home.

is a pavement. is an n z yeee pavement: 03-01 auckland, new zealand - town hall:"in the mouth a desert""trigger cut""ell ess two" (note: various sites report that they played "loretta's scars" or "elevate me later" here) update: "ell ess two" is an alternate title for "elevate me later". the title "ell ess two" refers to the fact that the song has the same chords as "loretta's scars". hence the confusion. thanks to pitchfork pavement expert matthew perpetua for pointing that out!"shady lane" "father to a sister of thought""rattled by the rush""perfume-v""summer babe""kennel district""silence kit""range life""unfair""stop breathin'""no life singed her""fight this generation""date w/ ikea""box elder""grounded""gold soundz""the hexx""give it a day""cut your hair""stereo""spit on a stranger"the picture of the setlist cuts off here, but other songs mentioned in a separate fan account are listed below:"conduit for sale!""loretta's scars""here"
