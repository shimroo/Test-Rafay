      what our customers are saying
    






dv

the breast ultrasound course was very informative! great material!! the instructors and staff were wonderful and helpful with any questions we had! the in-person lab was a great experience, especially for new scanners. well run and organized!



daniela vazquezin-person 





rb

this is an excellent course for both newly introduced ct technologists and senior ct technologists. i learned so much in 5 days, and i was able to readily apply this knowledge in the clinical setting. as a cross-training rt into ct, i was simply following commands and techniques presented to me by other technologists; but now i know what to look for, why i do certain things, and how to appropriately adjust my protocols as needed.

mtmi provided a very thorough and insightful look into the field of mammography. i’m so happy i attended the in-person course. the lectures were concise, covered so many important topics and any and all questions were always answered. the instructors are experts in their field. i feel i will be ready to take the boards from studying the material they provided. the hands-on positioning helped me get over feeling nervous and emphasized the different ways to practice the exams that will give the best images.

judy is an excellent instructor and brings many years of case experiences to share in this training!! i appreciate her expertise in different units and situations. i have never done a stereotactic bx, but feel that this program has allowed me to consider it in my future career path! thank you!

love taking mtmi mammography courses when i can! i'm the lead mammographer at my facility and am always eager to learn and be able to teach my techs and myself how to be better at what we do for our patients. thank you to miranda and all at mtmi for providing excellent learning opportunities from the comfort of home!

great review of material. easy to become complacent as a tech … doing the same thing every day, nice to see and hear someone go over all information pertaining to our workflow, step by step.

i am so glad i was guided to mtmi as a way to advance my career into mammography. all three instructors from my 5 day course were extremely knowledgeable, personable, and helpful in educating us on exactly what we need to know not only for the boards, but to be knowledgeable and caring mammographers. i would recommend this course to anyone looking for a fast and efficient path to mammography.
