madison did a fantastic job of correcting my hair color (from a drab dark brown to a beautiful reddish/copper)! she did it in one appointment and gave me a great hair cut. she was also incredibly nice. i highly recommend madison and this salon. i couldn’t be happier!mary  maloney



michelle frey does the most amazing facials. best i have ever had! she knows just what your skin needs and she includes the neck, chest and arms during her treatments. her massage techniques are varied and very soothing. her facials give great results! i highly recommend!lisa c
