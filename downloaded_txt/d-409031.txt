huff is primarily a civil rights organization concerned with exposing and correcting abuses by government and non-profit abuses against those outside.  we have very limited resources and do more information-sharing than direct action.

huff is santa cruz's oldest and most stubbornly persistent grass roots homeless advocacy group. we make trouble for the powers that be and fight institutional human rights abuses such as the santa cruz's cop-initiated "stay-away" law (scmc 13.08.100) which cops and rangers use to accompany harassment citations for using a park to sleep in at night (in a city with inadequate shelter)--scmc 13.08.100 banning unhoused folks from otherwise public spaces on pain of fine and jail before any court process.

huff is working to fight efforts by the merchants and city council to further a police crackdown on youth, homeless and counter-culture folks downtown. in the last decade, city council passed a variety of new laws, strengthening the anti-homeless "downtown ordinances". these changes gave police greater powers of selective enforcement downtown against poor and homeless people, political activists, street performers, and others. read more

street shit sheet archives  - read the street shit sheet online - issues date from 1988 through 2002 (with a few issues published intermittently thereafter) and contain many contemporary documents and articles, as well as commentary and original reporting from the street. note: the archives are graphic scans encapsulated in pdf format (image files, not text, and thus very large), and each file includes many issues. be patient when downloading. we've just recently rescanned the entire archive to correct problems with the original scanning process, so they're now generally in order by edition and within each issue. a complete bound set of street shit sheet archives is also available in the reserve section of the main branch (downtown) of the santa cruz public library. they are a fascinating look into one man's view of the history of homeless civil rights action in santa cruz county.
