private events and catering 



where long island celebrates! party purveyors for over 50 years, mulcahy’s houses versatile private rooms for all styles and sizes. following thousands of events, from bridal showers to birthdays, fundraisers to work functions, retirements to reunions and everything in between – we love seeing our spaces transformed each and every week. for the ultimate muls experience, book alongside your favorite live act and impress your guests with a built-in after party; catering clients get complimentary show admission… we pay the band so you don’t have to! 






take a tour







please note: the minimum requirement for a fully private party is 40 guests, but we offer a range of semi-private and vip alternatives if you fall under that number, and would like to integrate with a concert. learn more on those options at the vip upgrades page below. 









 





v.i.p. 



the best way to elevate your muls experience! general admission area is standing room only, so if you prefer a seated show with table service – vip is the way to go. options will vary by event and floor plan: intimate vip tables, open bar wristband packages for groups of 10 or more, premium bottle service, and semi-private parties are all within our repertoire.

parking 



there are a few parking options around muls, depending what on what time you visit. we have an agreement with bank of america (directly opposite) that our patrons may use their lot when the bank is closed. their hours are listed below.similarly, we are directly beneath the wantagh lirr station, so there are many spots that become available outside of commuter/peak train hours. there is also a large municipal lot to the north of park ave.bank of america opening hours: (please do not use the lot at these times) monday to thursday: 9am – 4pmfriday: 9am – 5pmsaturday: 9am – 2pmsunday: closed
