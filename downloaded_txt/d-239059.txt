fosterproviding a temporary home for a cat or dog is a gift that keeps on giving. animals that are fostered become more adoptable because of all the love, care and attention they are given. this is where they learn to trust again. opening your doors to a homeless pet is rewarding beyond words.

featured pets



finding a friend is easier than you think. all of our adoptable animals are superstars. here are a few examples.  

 

silas















meet silas, a sweet, medium-high-energy dog with a playful spirit and an eagerness to learn. silas is the perfect companion for someone who loves staying active and is looking for a loyal friend with lots of love to give. silas was found wandering the streets, scared and alone. since then, she's received veterinary care, is healthy, and is now ready for the next chapter of her life with a loving home. silas loves walks, playtime and cuddles! a few notes about silas: she is potty trained with continued consistent routines. she is approximately 25 pounds. she is cautious around new people: she doesn't like crowds and may take a little time to warm up, but with love and respect, her sweet and affectionate personality shines through. reactivity: silas can bark at and be reactive to people and other dogs during walks, but she's making significant improvements with training and guidance. she's eager to learn and will thrive with someone who can help her continue building confidence.



moose













hello there! my name is moose, and my favorite things in the world are food, naps, and relaxing with my humans. did i mention food?foster mom says i’m working hard on learning house rules since i didn’t have many before. i’m figuring out how to play with toys and enjoy the company of my five fur siblings. while i’m a bit socially awkward when it comes to playtime, i love being their biggest fan and cheering them on!i think every new person i meet is my bff. i’m polite, though—i wait patiently for them to come to me and hopefully offer a treat!here’s what makes me extra special:i meet new dogs appropriately.i’m amazing in my crate and house-trained. i won’t drag you down the street on a leash. i’m great with other dogs and gentle with kids, including foster mom’s 6-month-old daughter. oh, and i snore like your favorite grandpa!” if moose sounds like the right fit for your home, please reach out! he’s ready to be your new best friend and bring some chill vibes to your life. so far my foster mom has learned that every new person is my bff. although i love people, i won't drag you over to meet someone new i will patiently wait until they come over to say hello and pray they have a snack for me! i meet new dogs appropriately, i'm amazing in the crate, house trained, and i won't pull you down the street. i'm extremely treat motivated, good with other dogs, and a perfect gentleman with foster mom's 6-month old daughter. i know i sound perfect so far because i am and i'd love to tell you more about myself when you inquire about me! also if you have gotten to the end of my speech i want to thank you and let you know that my nickname is grandpa because i can fall asleep anywhere, in any position, and start snoring in an instant like your typical grandpa.



rogan 













hi there! my name is rogan! i am a good boy that is anxiously awaiting my forever home. i have been waiting for a long time and really hope 2025 will be my year! i am a smart guy and have gone through weeks of professional training. i know things like "sit" "down" "crate" "heel" "place" "off" and a couple other cool tricks. i sit for my meals and am working on sitting at the door before going outside on a walk. i do love walks! i can be pretty strong on leash but with the right collar and handler i do well. other things i love include cozy blankets, car rides, pup cups, laying in the sun, and balls. i am crate trained, and house trained. sometimes i get a little upset when people leave me behind at home and i will bark and whine for a few minutes before going to chew on my bone. while i do not chew up anything that i am not supposed to, i am a very strong chewer on my toys, so i am only allowed to have the really tough ones. my current foster mom has seen what good manners i have so she lets me sleep on the couchi have lived with another dog before and also attended doggy daycare awhile back and did well. however, i can come on strong, so would need a proper introduction with any new dogs to make sure we would be buds. i have not lived with cats before but have a feeling it would be hard not to chase them so i probably should not go to a home with cats. people on the other hand, i do great with! unfortunately, sometimes people see me or hear me bark and think i am scary, but i truly just want attention. i am a sucker for belly rubs and kisses. since i am big and strong, i may accidentally knock over small children, so i would probably do best in a home with older kids or with an adult only family.i am looking for a home that will keep up my training since i really do enjoy practicing all the things i know, and i want to be sure i do not forget any of them. i have been in several fosters home so sometimes i can get confused on the rules. i hope that my forever home will provide me with structure, boundaries and consistency so that i can be the best boy for you! my perfect family will take me on walks, throw balls for me, and cuddle with me. a fenced yard would be nice too since i enjoy being outside, but it is not a must since i am not as energetic as i was in my younger days.

 

sigourney













meet sigourney! sigourney had a rough start. living on the mean streets of winston-salem until help arrived. she and her 4 kittens were dodging cars and living off the kindness of strangers in the neighborhood. she is believed to be about 2 years old and has learned to trustagain. her name was selected because she is a survivor like her namesake sigourney weaver in the movie alien. she has evolved into a wonderful companion who will cuddle up next to her person and just wants to be loved. she is still as playful as a kitten and loves interactive toysand play but will carry around a catnip toy or a spring. she loves to explore her foster home and gets along well with other cats and kittens after she gets to know them. sigourney is spayed, fully vetted, and microchipped.



caesar













caesar is a sweet boy, and although he takes some time to warm up to you, he loves to be by your side. he loves to be pet but will let you know when he's had enough. he is quite playful and would do great in a calm, quiet home. he would do fine with older children as long as they know to give him space and not be too loud. he has not been introduced to other cats or dogs so we don't know how he will react to another pet. 



loki













loki is an affectionate and fun cat who loves attention and the company of people. he'll gladly follow you around all day and enjoys hanging out in the same room-just not on your lap. he's okay with being picked up for a bit, but what he loves most is being near you, playing chase, and getting head rubs. his favorite spots? sleeping on a dining chair tucked under the table or keeping watch from the window, observing the world outside. loki took some time to settle into his new environment, but he's grown bolder every day. he's well-trained, uses the litter box perfectly, and never scratches the furniture. super inquisitive, loki wants to explore every nook and cranny-closets, cupboards, even the mantelpiece!






 









our new address is 302 thurston street, winston-salem, nc 27103
















 

“aarf has been a tremendous organization to work with as a volunteer. they are responsive, helpful, resourceful, and approachable. most importantly, they always put the animals’ well-being first. i’m so grateful to aarf for giving me an opportunity to help these beautiful creatures.”—heather t., foster parent
