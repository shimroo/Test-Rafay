read what ‚Äúprimetime live‚Äù said in it‚Äôs nation-wide survey:
‚Äúthe unique and exotic quality of hawaiian tropical flowers is unmatched. on a spring segment of ‚Äúprimetime live,‚Äù a nationally-broadcast television program, a survey was done of 20 flower bouquets from florists across the united states. bouquets were equally matched in price and compared for beauty, durability, and other qualities. the two hawaiian flower growers bouquets rated numbers one and two in survey results. one hana grower reports that his phone began ‚Äòringing off the hook‚Äô after the airing of the segment.‚Äù ‚Äî maui news, sept 20, 1998

if i could do a 10-star rating, i would! i just ordered the double arrangement for my wife for our 40th wedding anniversay. the flowers were shipped ‚Äúovernight‚Äù, which is one day to the u.s. west coast, or two days to the east coast. they were in a sturdy package (14 pounds, if that gives you an idea of the size of this arrangement). just unwrap and put in a very large vase (they would have included one, but we had one).  they are perfectly arranged, so you don‚Äôt have to be a florist!  we were familiar with maui‚Äôs best flowers as we stayed at a house in hana where they supplied flower arrangements to beautify the house for guests.  stacy and terry were extremely helpful in taking my order by phone and changing the delivery date when my schedule changed.  my wife was stunned when she opened the box and saw the most beautiful flowers in the world!  thanks, stacy & terry!
