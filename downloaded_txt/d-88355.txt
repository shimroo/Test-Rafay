about reynoldsburg







reynoldsburg is known as "the birthplace of the tomato". the tomato was 'born' in reynoldsburg in the 19th century with the help of local favorite son alexander w. livingston. livingston developed the 'paragon tomato', billed as the first ever tomato bred for commercial use. his legacy lives on in the livingston house and museum on graham road, which is listed on the national registry of historic homes.
