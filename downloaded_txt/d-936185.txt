 to: santa clausfrom: ripleydestination: north pole dear santa,i have been a good girl all year.  i know you have been good to me in the past, but this year i only want one thing. and i really, really, really want it. all i want is john simm  - naked on my bed with a red ribbon tied around him - (please reference sam tyler, edward sexby, and the mister master for examples.) since this is the season of giving, i only need him for 24 hours after which he can return to his regular life. please, please get this gift for me santa. i promise to be a good girl next year too, if that helps.happy holidays,ripleyps. you come through on this for me and those pictures of you and a certain reindeer will be "our secret". anyone wanting to copy this particular item for their santa list, is more than welcome:)
