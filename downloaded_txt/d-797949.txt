what our clients say
























						“i realized that the difference between our relationship and any other client vendor relationship is that there is something about the people of newcity, there’s something about the philosophy and the approach that is truly people first. it’s truly relationship first – caring about your clients as human beings. and the fact that you all treat all of us that you work with at tennessee so thoughtfully and with such great kindness and care is it just transcends the working relationship.”					


chris echolsdirector of digital communications, ut knoxville 






						"as a valued partner, newcity has played a pivotal role in oklahoma state university’s journey toward greater brand awareness and unprecedented enrollment growth. newcity has been a key factor in osu’s recent successes, and we consider them not only as partners but as friends.”					





erin petrottadirector of marketing, oklahoma state university 






						“newcity has done an outstanding job of capturing all the necessary functionality for our project. this was no small task, as it involved numerous complex elements, including our integration with splashthat, helping us create a more thoughtful site-wide wayfinding experience, and elevating the site's search capabilities. their innovative approach to problem-solving and commitment to refining solutions has been exceptional, making a significant impact on the project’s success.” 					





daniel inlead web designer & front-end developer, calarts 






						"we wanted to reimagine our approach, and working with you all gave us a much-needed fresh perspective. we appreciate that you didn’t try to sell us a ‘product’ to solve all problems, but instead gave us research, tools, techniques — all the building blocks we needed to create a great new site."
					





ann morseexecutive director, cornell sce 






						"from start to finish, the skill and expertise of your team really shines through. from the initial proposal, to the first meetings with the dean and advisory committee, to our unflappable project manager, to the design, writing, architecture, and metrics — you’re just an incredibly strong group of professionals across the board."					





jenn kingdirector of communications, emory university school of medicine 






						“we have a fantastic rapport and respect through all our collaboration over the last several years. you all know us, you get what we do. you know what our goals are. we have that personal relationship. we can talk through things. so there's a trust there, where you're handing it over to someone who's as invested in your success as you are.”
