dr. doug kelley
when i moved to wisconsin from illinois several years ago i had a patient that inquired about lasik.  being new to the area i was not familiar with who the best surgeons were so i asked around to a few local doctors who all referred me to dr. probst at tlc.  i contacted tlc and was warmly invited to a dinner and continuing education event that dr. probst was presenting at.  i was very impressed with his charismatic personality and willingness to help answer all of my questions.  he even invited me to observe him perform a couple of procedures on my off day.  i had been co-managing refractive surgeries for about 5 years prior but i must say that dr. probst had the best outcomes of any other surgeon that i had worked with.  i have yet to have an unhappy patient with the vast majority of my patients saying that they see better after the surgery than they did before with their glasses and/or contact lenses.  i believe in dr. probst so much that last year i too decided i was tired of life with glasses and contacts so i had lasik done.  i am an avid swimmer and scuba diver so i never have to worry about losing my contacts again while i am out on a dive.  it also makes camping much easier not to have to worry how i'm going to clean my hands to handle my contact lenses.  the only down side to life with my new surgically enhanced vision is my wife gets annoyed at how well i am now able to see without any correction.

dr. jennifer hillmann
i had lasik done with dr. probst at tlc almost two months ago, and it was a wonderful experience!  as an optometrist, i know how safe lasik is and how accurate the results are.  however, as a patient, i was still nervous.  dr. probst and the staff at tlc walked me through the process, keeping me informed at each step.  now after the surgery, i have great vision and i'm free of contact lenses.  i'm very thankful for the excellent skills of dr. probst and his team.  lasik was life-changing for me!

dr. probst is as good as it can get with lasik surgery.  he has been treating my patients for over 10 yrs, and i have never had an unhappy patient! trust is an important factor in a doctor/patient relationship, and because my patients trust me to guide them through the important decision of choosing a surgeon, it is easy for me to send them to dr. probst, as he is a gifted surgeon with impeccable results.

i knew that if any of my children ever had lasik that the surgeon would be lou probst through tlc.  i recognized his expertise, the quality of hisoutcomes and the exceptionally low complication rate and low risk of requiringan enhancement at a later date.  dr. probstwas and is the only choice for lasik surgical procedures for my children, andour experience only confirmed that i had made the correct choice for jacobâssurgeon.

comments from my patients:
"iâm so glad i had lasik. it was one of the best decisions iâve made."
"i see great, i only wish i would not have waited so long to have lasik."
"i keep forgetting that i donât have contact lenses in. after lasik i havenât had to worry about cleaning and caring for my lenses anymore.  itâs great!"
"it was amazing to see the alarm clock when i woke up this morning."

i was so impressed and confident in dr. probst's ability that i asked him perform my own lasik procedure several years ago and the results have been fantastic. there is no question in my mind that dr. probst is one of the top lasik surgeons in the world.



dr. richard jun od
i confidently refer patients to dr. probst for lasik.  my patients are always impressed by the professional and friendly staff.  they leave with spectacularly clear vision and marvel at the easy experience.  my patientsâ results were so compelling, i had lasik too!  dr. probst and the staff invited me for a wet lab where i was able to operate the laser on a pigâs eye.  dr. probst and the staff took excellent care of me and made the procedure a walk in the park.  recovery was a breeze.  i am thrilled with my results and to be glasses free. now that i have been on both sides of the laser, i will continue to refer patients to dr. probst and the incredible tlc team.

i have seen the lasik results from many surgeons in the chicagoland area over the past 12 years and no one is better than dr probst. his experience in number of procedures performed as well as his passion for lasik is why i chose him as my lasik surgeon in 2001. my patients know that if i trust my vision to dr probst, so should they.

after learning about the procedure and searching for the right surgeon, i found tlc laser eye center to be the choice for my patients as well as myself. dr. lou probst is not only the most experienced refractive surgeon in the chicagoland area, but understands the needs of every individual and has the talent and expertise to make it happen for thousands of people. you cannot find a more skillful and dedicated surgeon when it comes to lasik.

as a firefighter, dealing with glasses and contacts is never practical or safe. if you wear glasses or contacts, you really don't know what you're missing until you've had the lasik procedure.

as a practicing optometrist for 26 years and a lasik co-managing doctor for over 15 years, i have had the benefit of knowing you and your work as we have cared for many patients together.  your experience and skill as a refractive surgeon is well known across the country and i can confirm it is warranted. i want to thank you for the fantastic results and care that you have provided for my many patients over these years.
my wife, who is also an optometrist, recently decided to have lasik. she choose you as her surgeon. the results could not have been better. it has truly been a life changing event for her. her vision today is better than 20/20! her healing has been very easy with literally no impact to her daily activities. also, being able to follow my wife through the whole procedure was a great opportunity for me. i can really appreciate the level of concern and care you and your team provided during her experience.

for many years our practice in eastern iowa has confidently referred patients to dr. probst due to his exceptional talent and precise results. so, there was no doubt in my mind that dr. probst would be the surgeon for me as well. my entire experience, from consult to surgery, was absolutely wonderful. the tlc team went above and beyond to care for my eyes and me. as an optometrist, experiencing every aspect of lasik firsthand has provided me the ability to comfortably and accurately discuss lasik with my patients. i assure every patient that if i trust dr. probst with my eyes, i trust him with theirs as well!

dr. tristan long
dr. probst is simply fantastic. i trust him with my patient's eyes just as i trusted him with my own. dr. probst and his staff did an exceptional job on my lasik surgery; i see wonderfully well with absolutely no subjective side effects. i encourage all of my patients interested in lasik to get a free consult with tlc and put their trust in dr. probst.

dr. nicholas bowen od
lasik has allowed me to enjoy my life so much more without the hassle of glasses or contacts. i can swim, ride my bike, and wake up every morning to see my clock without having to reach for my glasses. as an optometrist, i have seen the great results from dr. probst on several of my own patients. i had full confidence in his abilities before having lasik, and i am extremely pleased with my results. i can't recommend tlc and dr. probst enough.
