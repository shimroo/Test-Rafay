   january 7, 2025 - the rock shows?so someone alerted me that capcom of japan’s twitter/x account has announced that the mega shows are going to be subtitled and released in japan.  are they in for a trip.  i honestly have no idea what they are going to think of them—goofy, fun, crazy?  probably the biggest obstacle to overcome will be the art style, since it’s such a departure from the games and all of the other anime that was ever produced (with the exception of captain n...).  but once you get past that, some of the plots are pretty fun (and others are atrocious, but i’m pretending those episodes don’t exist).september 11, 2024 - secret leveli’m not going to be able to watch this (at least not immediately), but secret level seems to be a tv series for amazon’s prime video that involves someone (or multiple people?) winding up inside video games?  kind of like a photo-realistic 3d-animated version of captain n, with 100% more blood, guts, and gore.  it looks a little campy (what with the whole “you are the chosen” trope), but could be fun.  of course, the reason why i’m even mentioning it at all is because mega man (evidently classic series) is one of the numerous video games involved.  based on the previews, i’m guessing they are going to have to stretch out his proportions to make him fit in with the human characters, but, on the flip side, it does look as though they may stick more to his general game design than, say, the mega shows (although admittedly that body shape would fit in better).  we’ll know more soon since it releases at the end of this year.july 20, 2024 - mega man x fireballnew information for keeping the fireball when loading a password has been added to the mega man x1 page.  lazy people like me can start the game with the fireball straight off and avoid having to gather 1-ups and go through armored armadillo’s stage five times every time!july 1, 2024 - mega man x diveso to those of you who play mega man x dive—has there been an official in-game announcement yet that the game is shutting down?  evidently the servers will close down on july 30th.  but at least the good news is there’s an offline version you can fall back on!  (i wish that was true of other online games...)june 11, 2024 - mega man switchi’m a few days late on this, but if you have a switch, nintendo has added all five of the original series game boy titles to their online library lineup.  you can’t buy them and own them outright, but you can play them as long as you have a subscription.  one reader reports that the emulator even emulates the slowdown!  i’m not quite sure that this is an improvement.  makes you wonder if it’s more along the lines that it would take too many programming resources to eliminate the slowdown so they just left it as-is.  though what would a classic mega man game be without the flickering of the sprites when you fire off a fully-charged mega buster blast at that cluster of enemies?may 11, 2024 - song of the wheneverso i finally dug out an older game boy system (i had like three to choose from...) and recorded some music from mega man ii.  you can see my commentary on this month’s song of the whenever!april 5, 2024 - mega man in exoprimali don’t personally play exoprimal, so i don’t have much to contribute here, but for what it’s worth, capcom is adding a mega man cameo to the game in their title update 4.  it involves a boss fight against the yellow devil and some cosmetics.march 28, 2024 - song of the whenevera visitor requested the stage select music from mega man ii (gb) which i don’t seem to have readily available.  (i pretty much didn’t record any of the music from that game, from the looks of things.)  since reaching the stage select is quick and easy, recording that tune ordinarily wouldn’t be a problem.  i have the game.  i have a system that can play the game.  but turns out said system does not have a headphone port.  i don’t think you want me doing the old-school thing of holding a microphone up to the speakers.    so just to give me an excuse to update the song of the whenever, here’s the stage select music from mega man iii instead!  (in the meantime, i may go see if i can dig up an older system that can play the game and has a headphone port.  stay tuned!)february 13, 2024 - coffeeif you’ve enjoyed mmhp over the years and would like a way to show your appreciation, i’ve added a button to the sidebar to buy me a coffee (or hot chocolate, or tang, or e-tanks...).  i’d also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has shared with me how much you have enjoyed this site!  i do hope to keep it up as long as possible, even if not updated frequently.november 8, 2023 - emailsit has come to my attention that email messages that i send to certain email providers (most notably gmail) are not always reaching their recipients. so if you have sent me a message recently and have never received a response, this might be why. i am hoping to find a resolution soon.february 22, 2023 - mega man x minecraftnow this is pretty funny. it appears that a third party studio has created a mega man x-themed mod for minecraft. as far as i can tell it appears to be legitimately licensed (the trailer is on nintendo’s youtube channel), though i haven’t been able to try it out yet. (it looks crazy hard!)january 4, 2023 - mega man legothere’s another mega man lego kit being proposed, this one for the mecha dragon in mega man 2. feel free to check it out and offer it support and one day it might be on a store shelf!august 6, 2022 - rockman battle & fightersi suppose there is no need to put this on the previews page since it is already released, but it has come to my attention that the japanese-only game rockman battle & fighters is now available to english markets on the switch. as this game is basically a port of power battle and power fighters, it’s amusing it was released right around the same time that the original versions of these arcade games also hit the switch.july 1, 2022 - sega genesis expansion packare you tired of updates yet?  it was posted yesterday that mega man: the wily wars will be made available on the nintendo switch’s sega genesis emulator.  you can read their announcement here, in which mega man gets all caps.  i also think there is something amusing about a collection containing a collection.june 29, 2022 - battle network collectionwow, capcom just dropped an announcement for a legacy collection for battle network.  from the press release it appears the collection will contain every game in the main series, all versions, except that battle network 3 has only white and blue (well, technically that’s all it really had anyway). it doesn’t include the side games (such as battle chip challenge) but still, you’re getting both sides of the two-version games all in one package. aside: of course mega man has a youtube channel... june 29, 2022 - switch saleas a side note, a visitor notes that many of the mega man games for the nintendo switch are presently on sale.  i don’t (yet) have a switch to verify, but if you haven’t yet picked up some of the collections or mega man 11, this might be a good time.june 15, 2022 - arcade gamesi’m a little late to this, but capcom has announced a collection containing some of their old arcade games.  nicely, both power battle and power fighters made the cut.  so this will likely be your best opportunity to try the arcades if you’ve never played them before.january 27, 2022 - mega man x divehmm.  the formerly-mobile-only game called “mega man x dive” is going to be coming to steam.  capcom’s going to get me play this now, aren’t they?  (well, maybe in the future when they release it for north america.  right now it is technically still “rockman x dive.”  so we’ll see.)january 7, 2022 - server update updatebad news: there were kinks.  good news: i think i’ve worked them out.  so far in my perusals the site appears to be functioning.  if you run into any snags, feel free to let me know.december 4, 2021 - server updatethe server hosting mmhp is going to be receiving an upgrade at the turn of the year.  i don’t anticipate any serious problems, but there is always the chance of a glitch.  and considering the time of the year, it may be several days before i can clear up any issues that do occur.  so i just wanted to give advance notice that if mmhp seems to disappear suddenly, don’t panic.  i’ll get it back up and running as soon as possible!april 24, 2021 - making mega manit’s not officially announced yet by capcom (and might never be), but it does appear to be officially licensed.  there is set to be a kickstarter soon for an...interesting way to program and play your own mega man games.  might be worth taking a look at!february 5, 2021 - checking inwow, has it been a whole year since i last posted anything of substance?  apparently it has.  do we want to talk about 2020?  no, we don’t.  moving on... i’m still here and i’ve been making various fixes and updates on various pages here and there on an as-needed basis.  (thanks to everyone for the comments, suggestions, and flaw reports!)  barring another game release that i can actually play (cough), the site will likely be in maintenance mode for a while...but it’ll still be here for your reference and enjoyment!january 1, 2020 - new site revampyes, mmhp has undergone a complete code overhaul.  if you haven’t noticed any difference yet—great! more details can be found on the browsers page.  note: if any page looks odd for you, try reloading it.as always, with an undertaking this large, there are bound to be hiccups.  please bear with me as i work through the snags.note: there is still a lot of old code floating around. i tackled the major portions first and plan to go through fixing up the other bits over time.  so right now the site is a mixture of new and old code.december 3, 2019 - dragalia lostcapcom unity has the lowdown on this.  i’m honestly not sure whether this counts as a game or a playable cameo, or even just an appearance considering it’s a temporary thing (unless you build up enough power of friendship™ to get him to stick around permanently—c’mon, what’re you waiting for?).  yay for capcom making classification difficult!    i have to say, i’m amused by the take on mega man 2 and the plot regarding dr. wily opening a portal to the dragalia lost universe (captain n, anyone?).august 30, 2019 - zero/zx collectionmy email box exploded this morning.  as of this writing, capcom’s press page has very few details, but they are working on another collection, this one for the zero and zx series.  hey, if they keep up this pace, pretty soon they will have re-released every single mega man game at least once.  (come on, capcom, let’s see super adventure!)november 1, 2018 - mega man 11i’m going to go ahead and post the mega man 11 game hints page even though it’s still a bit of a work in progress.  (looking back on it, i’ve gotten wordy in my old age...)  sorry about the delay!  i’ll get the data base page up after i have a chance to collate all of the information.  i still have some testing and playing to do; after all, there are still some pits out there that i haven’t fallen into yet.october 9, 2018 - mega man 11hmm... i think maybe you’re supposed to do block man first.  just a wild guess.   october 2, 2018 - mega man 11you know, when the release date for mega man 11 was listed as october, i wasn’t expecting it to be two days into the month. i guess i should have been though, ’cuz it’s tuesday. many of you have probably already played the demo. now you can pick up the full game. here’s hoping my pc is able to handle it... september 8, 2018 - mega man 11 demoas you’ve probably heard, capcom is granting a sneak peek at mega man 11 through a downloadable demo.  be sure to check it out if you have one of the relevant systems!  (i don’t...)june 29, 2018 - what’s in a name?ah ha ha, now this is funny.  apparently mega man x legacy collection is going to revert the mega man x5 maverick names back to the ones used in the original game’s manual rather than the guns n’ roses names.  but actually, if the preview videos are any guide, they’re taking it one step further and they’re actually translating the stray japanese words into english equivalents like i did on the game hints page.  for example, spiral pegacion officially becomes spiral pegasus (which is what he should have been named all along—in my humble opinion).  i don’t yet have a list of all eight names but i’m sure that will be forthcoming because we’re getting really close to release day.april 12, 2018 - mega man x legacy collectionsi’ve hinted at these already, but may as well make official note of them.  so why’d they go and make two of them, requiring me to make two separate skeleton game hints pages?  (when i get around to it...)december 15, 2017 - christmas shoppingjust as a side note, while i was doing some online shopping for christmas gifts, amazon’s website decided to list for me a whole bunch of new mega man merchandise, some of which i hadn’t seen before.  (gee, i can’t imagine why it would do that.)  i’ve briefly updated the toys section accordingly, but man, there’s just no way to list everything.  there was once a time when i could pretty much scan examples of and list every type of toy available, but now...i can barely scratch the surface.  this is a good thing...except it does mean the toys page will likely never again be complete.december 5, 2017 - mega man 11okay, i have to admit, i did not expect this one.  i’m not even at my computer, so i can’t do a full and proper write-up of this at this time, but i wanted to get this out there.  merry christmas everyone, we’re getting a 2.5d mega man 11!november 3, 2017 - fan creationsi don’t do this very often, but visitors have been mailing me about things, and i’ve been very remiss in getting to them.  so in addition to updating the links section, i thought i’d give a few shout-outs: mega man maker - aka mega maker, a game focused on creating game levels.20xx - this is a non-mega man game that plays in the style of mega man, released on steam.  hey, if mighty no. 9 can get away with it, these guys ought to be able to as well.  key feature: 2-player co-op. mega man mania collage - this one’s artwork, not a game, but man, it must have taken a long time to put it together.  it’s so big it’s in chunks.super mighty power man - another mega man-style game, but this one being developed for console systems like the 3ds and possibly ps4 and xbox one. there’s more information on the facebook page.english covers - various anime musics (e.g. openings, etc.) redone in english lyrics, similar to tales of vesperia’s ring a bell english opening.  mega man x4’s japanese opening is redone here.c-busters - a crowd-funded heavy-metal remix of classic mega man musics.       this site was created with permission from      capcom, mega man, and all related characters are registered trademarks of capcom co., ltd. copyright © 1994-2025 miranda paugh. all rights reserved. | privacy
