i've been waffling for a long time whether or not i wanted to do this, but i finally decided to take the plunge. if you're already on my flist, no need to comment (thoughi'mdoingasmallitsybitsyflistcutsorrysorry), but if you're new, go ahead and shoot. i love new victims friends. though, i'm warning you, i'm a pretty terrible flister. i read everything on my flist; i just don't comment a lot, usually because i have nothing to say. but i do read it!  you can find out a lot more about me -- if you're so inclined -- on my profile, or you're more than welcome to pop up and say hi on aim @ a moment alive. though be warned, i have zero attention span. really. it's a disease.:dtags: friends only
