new blogger template





picked a new template for blogger, using one of the predefined ones. i'll tweak colors later or maybe find a better one in the blogosphere. adding adsense everywhere too.

my blog and linkdump





just a reminder for people who mistake this page for my blog: it's not :) (hi mleen!). it is my homepage. however, since google changed the way the old blogger worked and no longer permits ftp access for blogger pro users, it is now also a blogable page.
besides this page, use the menu on the left for all other pages. most of which still have the old lay-out, as i can longer upload new ones. but i keep my blog and my linkdump up to date.

new site counter





i'm fed up with nedstat (now web4u) and the extreme thingy. they served me well for several years. i'm switching site counter over to statcounter. free with options to buy if needed. fine. don't mind paying for good stuff. and pop-up or pop-under ads were driving me crazy!

the new blogger...





new blogger is great, but i have some gripes too. :)mainly, it is nice to have these lay-out blocks inside my designs. for instance, the menu and friendsring on the right. however, i can't copy these to other blogs. when you have several sites/blogs and want to copy certain content to then, you can't. so now i have to copy the &#@!@%!$@ lists over to all blogs. :( *sigh*

added links





i added links and smugs again in the right bar. kinda cool but it takes up a lot of space, this way. may have to override the css later on.

professional interest?





if you are interested in me professionally, please check my detailed profile in linkedin.it is well-kept and up to date, as well as more technically-oriented than my normal resume/cv.

bloggerpro access disabled





hi all... google has resolved their bloggerpro webhosting on october 31st. it was basically a normal webhost account with ftp access and subdirs, etc. due to their move to a new blogger, these accounts were no longer compatible and needed to be upgraded. to do that, they needed to take away the ftp access. :( sad but oh well, we did get a lot of new stuff back for it.so here i am, typing this, making a new blog/site entry/landing page with links to the existing content (they did not loose/remove that, just ftp access to it). so far i kinda like what the new blogger bèta offers. categories, page elements and lay-out functionality using drag&drop. i can add links and lists, just like i did previously but now from a comfortable gui.to make a long story short (too late), i like the new bèta and don't mind spending time to reedit all the pages and adjust lay-out at the same time.
