travel back to a sunny spring afternoon on merlefest's hillside stage, as the waybacks & friends pay homage to the rock classic, led zeppelin iv.

hillside album hour #10 approaches!



can't believe it will soon be 10 years since we began the hillside album hour at merlefest. we had no idea that our playful but passionate take on led zeppelin ii would evolve into such a joyful and festive annual event. it's been a rich creative endeavor and adventure for us and we want to say thanks to all of the guest artists over the years who have helped make it so and to all of you who have come out to share those special days at hillside with us. 

for our 10th album hour, we've decided to finally cover the classic album . . . oh wait . . . it's supposed to be a secret. speaking of which, we invite you to head on over to our facebook page to try to decipher our impossibly challenging array of clues. trust us, they're harder and more obscure this year than ever before, simply because you've all gotten so good at figuring things out. 

that said, give it your best shot at our 2017 hillside album hour guess-a-thon!

hope to see you at hillside on saturday, april 29th for our 10th album hour and merlefest's 30th anniversary!
