lamentation / jubilation

a r t i s t   s t a t e m e n t :
my on-going work, lamentation & jubilation, consists of two installations of individual portraits, the placement of which shifts as i continue to add new images.
initially, i painted lamentation to express my reaction to the tragedy of september 11th. as i worked, the world situation worsened. i realized my subject, lamentation, was not restricted to this one horrific event, but was universal and historical. i needed to make a more global statement against war, hatred, and intolerance.
to this end, i juxtapose portraits in a symbolic way. for example, next to a grief-stricken palestinian woman, i place an israeli man in a state of shock; a black woman and a white woman are next to one another, and their gestures of grief are identical; next to a stoic elderly woman is a crying young child.
jubilation is the antidote and foil to lamentation. i depict the faces of family members and friends as they express happiness and amusement in all their varied manifestations. lamentation & jubilation exemplify the extremes of human emotion. in painting these two bodies of work, i have portrayed aspects of the human condition that we all experience and that remind us that despite our differences, we are essentially the same.
