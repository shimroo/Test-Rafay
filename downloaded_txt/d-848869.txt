i would like to express my gratitude to uniforce for providing us the opportunity to have hillary come and help us at a time we needed help.  she represented your company very well and i am very pleased with my overall experience with her, as well as uniforce.  i appreciate your professionalism and how simple you made the process and how you helped uncomplicate a transition at a time when it was needed most. warren b, training director, national labor union 

i would refer any of my friends to uniforce.  cathy has been my recruiter since 2019.  she is in amazing and outstanding recruiter; such a sweet person.  she always goes the extra mile to keep me working with great companies, great colleagues, and great doctor's.  i learned different techniques and training on different software's, which will help me grow to do the job in other medical offices, thank you for all your help and for keeping me working in a safe place during this pandemic.  cathy is an outstanding person who will go an extra mile to keep you working.   marcella n. , medical assitant 

i want to thank you again for your help with securing laurie as our new full time payroll manager.  it was a seamless transition and truly a pleasure to do business with uniforce staffing solutions. robyn s. vp of human resources, major retailer 

the opportunity for working for uniforce has been one of the best experiences in my career. all the way from recruitment to human resources, it has been nothing short of one of the most stable professional environment i have ever worked in. john, respiratory therapist 

i just wanted to express our appreciation for the professional level of quality applicants we received from uniforce. we ended up hiring two uniforce staffers on a temporary basis for an extended project and we are considering hiring one of them full-time. it is wonderful to have the flexibility of having temporary help with the possibility of converting them to full employees. keep up the great work! yitz, cfo, public utilities commission 

well, what can i say?  working with uniforce has been amazing!  i wasn't even out of work a week and had an interview lined up.  i was hired the same day!  as for the employees, i can say everyone was great.  i cannot put into words how amazing my recruiter was.  she went above and beyond to help me find something suitable and fast.  she even contacted me on her time off to make sure everything was ok.  i'm hoping that this job they found me keeps me permanent.  if not, i will definitely go back to uniforce! sandra a., medical biller at a major hospital 

the team at uniforce has consistently been business partners who truly understand our business and consistently presented the most outstanding, qualified candidates in support of our company's success. uniforce's client-service, results-orientation approach is exceptional. not only is uniforce a full-service staffing partner, their ability to provide 3rd party payroll outsourcing and temp-to-hire solutions enables them to provide the total package. many thanks from my team to yours! for all the reasons above, i highly recommend the team at uniforce staffing solutions without reservation. lori force, hr business partner, branding industry 

more than an employment agency. a full service staffing partner providing third party payroll outsourcing & temp-to-hire staffing solutions. shelly,  svp hr, consumer products co. 

my experience with uniforce has been great. everyone in the staff is kind and pleasant. all my emails are always answered within a timely manner.  diana, hr administrator 

my overall experience with uniforce in finding a new job has been wonderful. from the time my recruiter and i first talked, he didn't give me the same old speech. instead he told me straight out 'if you want this job i can get it for you'. my uniforce recruiter was explicit in his description of my job and what the job entailed. i had 2 phone interviews and 1 face-to-face with the hiring manager. after the interview, i knew i had the job. my recruiter called me back and asked if i want the job and i quickly replied 'yes'. and then he said, 'no, julious do you want the job?' of course i did. i was very happy and it made my week! in a course of a few days, uniforce got me a new career in the it department at a major international company in north carolina. thank you very much to the uniforce family! julious, systems analyst 

i enjoyed working my assignment with uniforce staffing. the staffing agency was very kind and supportive of employees. the doctor and  nurses were great to work for and very considerate. 
would be very happy to accept another working assignment with uniforce staffing.
 diane, cma 

working with uniforce has been a great experience.  the hiring process was extremely quick and easy.  everyone has been extremely responsive to any questions or concerns that i have had. thank you.
 andrew, marketing 

i want to first thank my uniforce recruiter for the initial employment opportunity. i greatly appreciated the opportunity to work as a long term temporary employee with uniforce. i was able to polish and develop my skills with uniforce ; that ultimately led to a permanent position. uniforce was able to identify areas where i needed to be more effective, in order to be the optimal employee for the company i was contracted to. the staff at uniforce is very personable and always had an open door policy. i did gain permanent employment as an end result, but i also gained a strong friendship and respect for uniforce staffing solutions. i will be proactive in referring people to uniforce based off my positive experience. jonah s., inside sales  

my experience as a uniforce employee has been very positive.
from the minute my recruiter called me to offer me a position, passing thru the onboarding process, the payroll system, etc...everything has been very thorough and easy to understand.
my recruiter and the payroll staff is always available to answer my questions or concerns in a kind and reassuring way.
i am very happy to be part of the uniforce team!! thank you all!! :)
 natalia, cma 

my experience as a uniforce employee has been very pleasant and rewarding. my job opportunity has enabled me to confirm my career goals and make me feel more confident in the path that i have chosen. as a college student, it is not easy to find opportunities that fit my schedule. however, being able to get real experience for great pay that works with my schedule is everything i could ever ask for! 
the staff at uniforce is very friendly and understanding. i have so far enjoyed my experience and have no complaints whatsoever! i look forward to continuing to work for uniforce staffing! 
 emily, administrative assistant 

thanks a million for working with me to find a contract or permanent opportunity. your professional demeanor, consistency, personal attention, integrity, reliability, dedication, and belief in my knowledge and skills encourage me to continue to succeed. there should be more staffing managers and human resources professionals with your dedication.
my advice to future candidates is that when you are in the field representing uniforce , i strongly suggest keep a positive attitude, maintain good attendance and always be on time. you will be surprised at who will notice and offer you a permanent position when you least expect it.

thank for all your help, uniforce ! julwel., hr consultant 

my experience with uniforce is a very pleasant one. i do enjoy the job they matched me up with!  i must admit i do feel that it is a perfect fit for me. the hiring process went very well and very smoothly.  all staff is always very professional, courteous, and helpful.  no problems at all with onboarding, everything went smoothly and efficiently.  communication is always good.  i usually choose to e-mail any questions i may have & they are always answered correctly as soon as possible.  mary, administrative assistant 

everything is going extremely well here, and i am enjoying the position as well as the company. i would like to thank you again for aligning me with this opportunity.
it is with great pleasure that i recommend uniforce staffing solutions to everyone currently in pursuit of a new career opportunity, whether they seek temporary work or a permanent position. their expert recruiters were able to find an excellent full-time position with an industry leading firm in my area of interest. the coaching they provided helped me to truly stand out in my interviews, and within a few weeks i was starting my new career. their communication and professionalism throughout the entire employment process was outstanding. i am exceedingly grateful that i contacted uniforce staffing solutions! craig h., national sales 

uniforce staffing solutions is a great agency to work for. they found me a job when no one else could. i was out of work for 6 months and they found me a job with a tooling manufacturing company in houston, tx. 
within three months of working as a consultant uniforce was able to negotiate a deal to make me a permanent employee. i highly recommend working or starting your career with uniforce . herbert,  it support  

i am really glad to work with guys. it was very smooth to come aboard. this happened almost four years ago. i was supposed to be here for couple months and here i am. no problems with communications. thanks. orlando, customer service
