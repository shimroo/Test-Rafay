“i find the craft in good condition. we are not suffering from any major problems' that we have not seen before.  i have visited all our districts and wherever i went the craft was very responsive and cooperative.  we have in the jurisdiction 65 lodges and our membership stands around 2,200.  this past masonic year i made it a main focus be appointing a membership and reclamation committee that was empowered to explore the latest technology retain our present members and attract new ones.  


my edict waving assessment fees by members wanting to reinstate paid dividends by the looks of the numbers captured in the grand secretary’s annual report.  


the reclamation part was decent however we have to work on the retaining part where we still are losing a significant number of brothers to non-payment of dues.  we can’t reclaim 5 and then turn around and dropped 3.  we somehow got to find ways to keep our young brothers interested in lodge meetings.  key word is interested…if they see we are not doing anything productive and that good for the order then they turn their interest elsewhere.  


i must say and with consequences we have few brothers in this jurisdiction that just seems to be on the other side of the fence regardless if right or wrong.  


i made it quite clear at the beginning of this administration that you were either “for” the grand lodge or “against.”  my exact conversation was that there would be no fence riders.”  

warm regards,

however, due to the injustices of the social system that was in vogue during that time, the majority of the other white grand lodges in the united states and canada withdrew masonic relations with the grand lodge of washington until the aforementioned resolution was repealed. bowing to masonic pressure from across the united stated and canada, the said resolution was rescinded at the grand lodge session in june 1899, and until june 1990, ninety-one (91) years later, the grand lodge of free and accepted masons of washington passed a resolution (90-23) recognizing the prince hall grand lodge, f. & a.m., washington and jurisdiction as regular, lawful and legitimate" and to all masons there unto belonging, granting the said prince hall masons the rights of visitation to all lodges in its jurisdiction as well as the grand lodge in session and other masonic privileges that are commonly granted to other grand lodges, and in july 1990 the most worshipful prince hall grand lodge, f. & a.m. passed a similar resolution (10-90) granting the grand lodge of free and accepted masons of washington the same privileges and rights.massachusetts grand lodgeon march 12, 1947, negro freemasonry in massachusetts of the "prince hall affiliation" was acknowledged by the grand lodge of masons (white) of massachusetts to be legitimate and "duly constituted." the committee's report authenticating prince hall freemasonry was accepted, approved and recorded by a unanimous vote. this action of the grand lodge was like a declaratory court decree. it holds that "origin, early procedures and subsequent development of the so-called prince hall freemasonry in massachusetts have been and are regular and legitimate."the grand lodge of massachusetts (white) traces its history as a duly constituted organization to 1733 and prince hall freemasonry to 1787 when african lodge began to function under its charter.regarding any other groups of negroes who claim to be masons, the committee reported that "we have found no evidence in support of such claims and our conclusion thus far is that the so-called 'prince hall' freemasonry is alone entitled to any claim of legitimacy among negroes of this commonwealth."first negro lodges in washingtonthe first lodge of negro masons in washington was started as a club in may, 1889, at roslyn. it was organized by district deputy grand master j. e. shepperson under the jurisdiction of the m.w. grand lodge of iowa as cascade lodge u.d. in 1890. it received its charter in 1897 and became known as cascade lodge no. 23. trinity lodge no. 28, a.f. and a.m., was organized u.d. october 2, 1902, in seattle, and was chartered august 4, 1903 by the iowa jurisdiction. guiding star lodge no. 31, a.f. and a.m., was organized u.d. in 1904 in north yakima and was chartered in 1905 by the iowa jurisdiction.four lodges were organized in this area by the grand lodge of illinois. they were enterprise lodge no. 47, a.f. and a.m. of portland, oregon, organized in 1891;
