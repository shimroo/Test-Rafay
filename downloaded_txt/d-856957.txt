  this #givingtuesday we are so grateful to our members who have together given away $4,408,550 to the wonderful okc metro area nonprofits listed here.

all of these nonprofits had their financials screened by our 990 club and underwent a site visit from our grant focus area committees. this list includes the $100,000 winners as well as the finalists who split any remaining funds each year. if you are feeling generous today, they would appreciate your support!

as we approach our 20th year of giving away $100,000 grants to fund dream projects, we invite you to join us! the more members we have, the more money we can give away and our dream is to fund one grant from each of our five focus areas (education, community, arts and culture, family and health and wellness). share this post to your stories or tag a friend who needs to know about us. learn more on our website or at our meet and greet at @williamlaurenco coming up january 30th.

  do you want to be on a focus area committee this year? now is the time to join! all paid members (or members on payment plans) by november 30th can sign up for their favorite placement in the link in bio. 

committee members will individually review all of the grant applications in their focus area (arts and culture, family, community, health and wellness or education) and meet for a few hours in january/february to discuss your top three to select for a site visit in march. the site visit takes place on a half day during the week and each nonprofit gets one hour to win you over. the time commitment is minimal, but the impact is significant. you can help decide who makes it to the stage at our awards celebration on may 15th to win $100,000! 

share this post with your friends!

  in celebration of 20 years of giving $100,000 grants to the oklahoma city community, which have to date funded 32 dream projects and totaled over $4.4 million, we’d like to recognize the outstanding work of some of our beneficiaries. our first update comes from @varietycare (oklahoma community health services), one of our 2007 winners: 

variety care used impact oklahoma funds to pilot a project supporting oral health for pregnant women and young children that has blossomed into the healthy expectations program, one of our premier initiatives. 

healthy expectations provides advocacy and education to women from prenatal care through the child’s 5th birthday. one of the focus areas of healthy expectations is encouraging pregnant persons to obtain oral health care for themselves and their young children. healthy expectations advocates work directly with the dental department to make appointments for pregnant persons, and pediatric staff continue the effort to link young children with dental care. 

in addition to preventive and restorative dental services, we now offer sedation dentistry at our straka terrace location. very young children may receive dental treatment under anesthesia in cases where their age or other circumstances make it difficult for them to receive treatment traditionally. 

when we applied for impact oklahoma funding for this program in 2007, we provided prenatal care for 1,200 women. in the last 12 months, we provided prenatal care for 4,041 pregnant people. impact oklahoma’s investment in oral health has grown far beyond our initial expectations!

if you would like to be a part of an organization that makes a difference, we invite you to join us through our website. members on a payment plan or paid in full by november 30th have the opportunity to join a focus area committee for grants, which includes reading grant proposals, performing site visits and selecting a finalist for our may 15th awards celebration. 

the more members we have, the more money we can give away, so invite your friends!
