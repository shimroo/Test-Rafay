bipartisan election security panel - mesa, september 16





 i'm part of a bipartisan (and all star!) grand canyon state election security event
on monday, september 16th, 2024, at 7 pm mst in the conference theater in
building b at the mesa convention center. the event
will feature a bipartisan discussion of common concerns related to election
security and integrity in arizona and maricopa county, by former members of congress hon. karan english (d-az) and hon. matt salmon (r-az), secretary of state hon. adrian
fontes (d-az), maricopa county recorder hon. stephen richer (r-az), and me (d-az). the
panel will be followed by a question-and-answer period where audience members
can engage in a dialogue with our panelists on this topic.
please rsvp to electionstownhall@usafmc.org 

panelists:

the
     hon. sam coppersmith (d-az, 1993-1995)
the
     hon. karan english (d-az, 1993-1995)
the
     hon. adrian fontes, arizona secretary of state (d-az, 2023-present)
the
     hon. stephen richer, maricopa county recorder (r-az, 2021-present)
the
     hon. matt salmon (r-az, 1995-2001; 2013-2017) 
moderator: 

tbd
program time: 7 pm-8:15 pm et
program venue: mesa convention center, building b,
conference theater (263 n. center street, mesa, az 85201)
parking: there is ample parking at the mesa convention center.
audience & rationale behind event: this will be a town hall-style event for an
audience made up of mesa and surrounding area veterans, small business leaders,
police, firefighters, faith leaders because those groups poll the best when it
comes to who voters on both sides of the aisle trust in arizona, as well as
members of other associations and civically active groups. the goal of the town
hall is to give those trusted messengers, the information they need to share
with their constituents, peers, and neighbors, why arizona and maricopa county
elections are secure and fair, from when the event takes place on september 16th
through the november election. 
program summary: the hour-to-ninety-minute-long program
will begin with a thirty-to-forty-minute-long panel discussion, which will
address the most common concerns voters on either side of the aisle have about
arizona and maricopa county elections, what measures are in place to prevent
those concerns from happening, and an explanation of relevant election law and
processes.

oregon 70.3





ironman oregon 70.3, in salem, was my big race for the year. i signed up august of last year, because the race always sells out fast, without realizing that i might not want to do a big race less than 2 months after my wedding - or without knowing that tribike transport would go out of business and disappear after i paid for shipping but before the race.but even with everything that was going on, and a foot injury in late may that prevented running at all for a month, i had a pretty good day, considering: 6:52:20, about a minute-and-a-half slower than last year at maine, but a very reasonable finish in my age group (39/52), considering i am at the oldest part of 65-69.very nice course. it's a downhill swim that other people did faster than me, but i went without a wetsuit based on my experience last year. i wound up 6 minutes slower in the willamette than in the kennebec, as the best current was off to my left. transitions were fine. i had an excellent bike ride, with a negative split by 13 (!) minutes, but a very slow run, which was more like a race walk. still, under 7 hours, which was my original goal. additional photos here, full results here.the numbers:swim 26:19 (no wetsuit)t1 9:46bike 3:14:02 (with negative split, 1:39:31/1:26:11)t2 7:50run 2:54:25overall 6:52:20division 39/52 (+2 beyond cutoff and +6 dns), gender 1,148/1,334, overall 1,774/2,232, im points 1475weirdly, as far as the race selling out, i walked to the swim start with a retired physician from salem, whose wife worked as a volunteer at check-in, who told me that about 300 people registered for the event did not check in before it closed on saturday - so there were potentially ~300 "standby" slots available that world triathlon corporation could have sold twice (and you know they would do it if they could).

cactus man triathlon 2024





this year's course changed from past years. the biggest change was the bike course, which stayed west of mill avenue, which meant the sprint course was 2 loops and the "international" (not olympic) course was 4 loops, and even so, the bike course was more than 5 miles shorter than past years. the run course also went west of transition and the tempe arts center, so fewer climbs (or "climbs") and it was measured accurately, at least by my watch.with the shorter bike time, i managed to finish under 3 hours (by 17 seconds!), but that made me 12/13 in my age group. (too many fast 65-year-olds.) swim was about the same as last year, bike was 20 minutes shorter due to the shorter course, and run was almost 3 minutes faster. where i lost time was in t1, where i started to cramp coming out of my wetsuit and had to work through that, and lost about 3 minutes. full results here, my result here, photos here.data:swim 30:54.9 (wetsuit)t1 7:05.2 (wetsuit-related cramp)bike 1:06:52.8 (under 20 miles)t2 3:17.8run 1:11:31.9overall 2:59:42.8division 12/13, gender 191/222, overall 242/286

quartz peak





another hike that had been on my internal list, quartz peak in the sierra estrella wilderness southwest of phoenix. 2,500' elevation gain to over 4,000' in less than 3 miles. photos by friends, as my phone locked up from trying to search for a signal in this remote location.
