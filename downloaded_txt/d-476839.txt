insights into bible action wordsdr. jim girdwoodall languages have different ways of describing action. greek action words (verbs) present actions different from those we are familiar with in english. for example: english discusses actions as past, present, or future, with some variety in each idea. greek also discusses actions as past, present, or future, and also has some variety in each idea. the time and kind of action are called the “tense.”

highlighting discipleship.orgthere is a national conversation about discipleship going on right now. in some circles, it is the hot topic, with lots of convincing, inspiring, and good ideas. we believe god is at work in the midst of this dialogue. discipleship.org wants to pour gasoline on the fires that are being lit and the authentic practices that are being championed. we hope to serve as a centralizing platform for this conversation. read more →

book review: blinded by the bible by kevin pendergrass



oct 18, 2022




many people who grew up with a legalistic concept of the bible have a lot of reprogramming to do, and it can be very hard to know how to untie the knots that we become comfortable with. we need a trusted guide to show us a better path ahead because there can be many missteps one can take along that journey that can derail one's faith.

book review and reflection: at the blue hole: elegy for a church on the edge by jack r. reese



dec 21, 2021




reese writes at the blue hole as a hopeful, honest retrospective of the churches of christ as a movement. today, many individual congregations are facing the question of their future. they look back wistfully at a golden age in their life, often in the 1980s and perhaps the 1990s, when their congregation was full of families and displayed a dynamic congregational life.

book review: "in the great stream" by leonard allen



sep 8, 2021




reading this book was an extended experience of clarity for me and i think it will be for you as well. there are things we hear that we just aren't so certain are true but don't have the background or information to back it up. it isn't that we are upset, we just need clarity in order to see reality.

jan 12, 2021




i’m grateful for the invitation to write a poetry column for wineskins, and to share my passion for non-sappy christian verse (and the connection with bible passages.) the most oft-printed poem i’ve ever written appears in the howard publishing company hymnbook, songs of faith and praise. i offer it here as a (perhaps familiar) introduction to my poetry.
