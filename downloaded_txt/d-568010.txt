welcome to mysticweb








mysticweb was a website originally established in 2001 by belsebuub. this website was the original home of his free online courses in astral travel and dreams, self-knowledge, esoteric wisdom and advanced investigations.
mysticweb operated in its full capacity from 2001 – 2005. it no longer runs courses.
this website was created as a retrospective look at the content offered on mysticweb.org.
mysticweb was an online hub for spiritual topics, with its stated purposes being to advance esoteric knowledge and help people discover the nature of reality and what’s really going on in life. the site contained informative articles across a broad range of spiritual topics, articles where people shared their personal experience of spiritual practices, and most importantly hands-on techniques for people to gain experience with a practical form of spirituality in their own life.

in 2001 while the internet was still in relative infancy, mysticweb was established by belsebuub as a site that could reach many people around the world interested in spiritual development. from its very beginning one of mysticweb’s primary functions was to share practical spiritual information through the structure of its free online courses which he authored. along with articles and free courses there were lively forums, a chatroom and a guestbook, which were popular features of the website.
