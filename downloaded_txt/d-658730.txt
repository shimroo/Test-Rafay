                                                a preview of the seven-hour marathon performance of radio bloomsday, our annual tribute to james joyce, broadcasting at 7pm to 2am later tonight. the galway-born actress and director caraid o'brien shares some of her ideas and innovations in constructing this year's father's day theme, "in search of a father," including the startling notion of casting two molly blooms -- herself and the irish actress bernadette quigley (who will also be a guest) -- to perform the two and a half hour soliloquy that constitutes the final "penelope" chapter of joyce's masterpiece "ulysses."

more gore!
gore vidal "on post election 2004 & america's discovery of god," a re-broadcast of another of the great dissenter's programs created exclusively for wbai. 



august 5 11 am
a tribute to gore vidal, our first host
in february 2004, as the presidential campaign began to take shape, the great american author and intellectual gore vidal, who died last week at the age of 86., became the first and, for a year, recurring host of this program.  his subject was u.s.  politics and the american empire. today’s show, “yellow roses,” is a re-broadcast of one of vidal’s incisive, biting, eloquent and prescient editions of the next hour. it highlights vidal’s view of america’s “liberating” armies with personal memories of serving in world war ii and young men used as cannon fodder; excerpts from the anti-imperialist broadway musical “the golden apple” (with lyrics by vidal’s friend john latouche); and vidalian explication and imitations of the sound slips of george w. bush.
