about the program


who it’s for
service members (active duty, guard, reserve), healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, counselors, etc.), first responders (medics, firefighters, police officers) and their families

what to expect
a safe and confidential environment where you can build lasting relationships while exploring and healing your trauma — all alongside others who have 'been there'

program model
our 90-minute webinar begins with a meet and greet — then, small groups are led by facilitators and shepherds who are trained by experts on pts, ptsd and trauma recovery
 

“we receive training for skills, yet receive little or no training for dealing with the side effects we face day to day. for too long, individuals have fought this battle themselves — now they don’t have to suffer from their invisible wounds alone. this program provides answers from professionals who have had their own boots in the sand. they just get it.”— lt ed schmidt, bsn, bs, rn, lp
