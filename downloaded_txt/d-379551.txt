how our customers feel about it
“ok i stand before you and say, “i am pat and i am addicted to famous dave’s pickles.”
i usually have a minimum of 3 jars in the pantry. well, you went and did it again. i made a pot of chili and had no crackers to serve with it, so i made famous dave’s cornbread mix. my husband said the cornbread was awesome! i pulled the box out of the trash to show him what kind i made. he could not believe how good it was. so needless to say we are now hooked on your cornbread! thanks!

“my mom and i put famous dave’s steak & burger seasoning on turkey burgers to kick them up a notch.”
this seasoning took a lame grey piece of ground turkey and made it a very tasty burger. my mom will not cook them without it. highly recommend you have this in your spice rack and try it on almost any meat you grill.
