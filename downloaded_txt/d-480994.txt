hear from current students




“my favorite thing about the department of music is the community. if i need any help, i know that i have friends and faculty that i can turn to. i also feel so motivated by being surrounded by so many hardworking students who have similar passions as me.“
jane choba in music (cello) & ba in communications (mass media)





“my favorite thing about the department of music is how close everyone is with one another. as someone with another major, completely unrelated to the arts, it’s very refreshing to see this sense of community within our building. i also love going to charlotte symphony performances in uptown!”
sufian azfarba in music & bs in computer science





“i have the belk performing arts scholarship, the marching band scholarship, and the vickie and gene johnson marching band scholarship. all of these scholarships really help me when it comes to taking job opportunities and in my grad school preparation.”
christopher smithba in instrumental performance
