why is bermuda sand pink?





the pink sand beaches of bermuda are a real thing. they're not bright neon pink, but the sand does have a true pinkish hue.


why is the sand pink? there is a scientific explanation. an article in bermuda's royal gazette explains ...



in bermuda, one particular species of red foraminifera, homotrema rubrum, grows abundantly on the undersides of coral ledges. when the forams die, either naturally or from the crushing forces of wave action, their tests sink to the bottom. over time, tidal forces and waves wash these tests ashore, where they mix with the white crushed skeletons of other marine organisms, giving the sand a pink hue.
and there you have it. the foraminifera did it.

cruise from savannah to bermuda





the cruise from savannah to the islands of bermuda. a dream of generations of residents of georgia who wonder why they can't have vacation voyages from their fine port city.

savannah is a favorite destination of many americans. it has historic architecture, beautiful squares, tasty southern food, and nearby beach resorts. so why haven't any of the cruise lines connected this port to bermuda?

the nearest options are cruises to bermuda from norfolk virginia or bermuda cruises from florida. those choices are obviously small comfort to people in georgia.

california to bermuda cruise





are there cruises from california to bermuda? not really, but technically yes.

okay, that's a cryptic answer. there is a cruise that goes from los angeles to bermuda. the catch is that it's a world cruise. the 111-day world cruise on princess cruises departs from la on january 2016, and among the many places it stops is bermuda.

so technically the cruise does go to bermuda from california, and it's even a round-trip voyage. but it takes the long way around the world to get there.

learn all about cruises from california. there are 3 departure ports in the golden state, and voyages to a multitude of destinations.

cruise from charleston sc to bermuda









we boarded the cruise ship downtown, close to all of the historic attractions. we were off on a bermuda cruise from charleston sc. the occasion was my wife's birthday. she's the cruise nut in the family, but i enjoy them too.

our documents were all in order and boarding was surprisingly swift. we've been on other trips that were quite slow. the luggage quickly made its way to our stateroom and we were off.

the atlantic was fortunately calm. most of the time there was hardly a ripple of waves. unusual, but we'll accept our luck happily.

on the way to bermuda my wife took advantage of the ship's spa and i hit the fitness center every morning. at night we went to the live show, which was only fair, and caught a movie in the theater.

the food on the ship is the usual cruise fare. it's mass-produced and showy, but not exactly healthy. we went with the flow and enjoyed it as much as we could, but we didn't pig out like many passengers do.

bermuda we docked at king's wharf. that's at the far end of the islands, away from the two main towns. there are shuttles into the towns so that's no big deal.

we walked around to the many historic sites. they're well worth exploring. bermuda and charleston have a similar history that is very interesting. we also spent a day on the beach. the sand is sort of a pink color, but not in a dramatic way. i played nine holes of golf one afternoon.

all in all, our vacation cruise to bermuda was a smashing success. we'll definitely return some day.

disney cruise to bermuda





it would be wonderful if there were cruises to bermuda on disney cruise line. unfortunately, there aren't any at this time. as this family-oriented cruise line grows it might expand operations to more destinations.

disney cruises attract families with young children. their big programs and facilities for entertaining kids are the best. the disney experience is woven into the staterooms and dining rooms too.

while the kids are off enjoying themselves, their parents can have fun in the special adults-only places onboard.

we will post more information if disney cruise line announces bermuda cruises.
