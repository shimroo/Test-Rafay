come out a walk in peace to honor the international day of peace 9-21 & 911 day of service. this is a non political or religious event. the idea is to have community walk together in community and friendship. we encourage walkers to wear all white if possible. all are welcome, that includes little ones and our furry friends. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.2645575,-118.5231514,3a,75y,280.92h,72.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syh4mp3_7oao5tj3igwflwq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656
