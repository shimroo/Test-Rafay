welcome to the digital library federation 



dlf serves all who are invested in the success of libraries, museums, and archives in the digital age. 






about










events















what's the dlf? 



networked member institutions and a robust community of practice—advancing research, learning, social justice, and the public good through the creative design and wise application of digital library technologies. 







 



dlf as community 



find your people, year-round. grassroots, pragmatic, and mission-driven, dlf is a space where ideas are road-tested and shared strategies and visions emerge. 







 



dlf as platform 



get things done. we foster active, open, and welcoming working groups dedicated to building better libraries, museums, and archives for the digital age. 







 



dlf as crossroads 



meet up. our annual dlf forum serves as meeting place, marketplace, and congress for diglib practitioners from member institutions and the community at large.
