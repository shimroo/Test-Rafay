community that lasts a lifetime
when you join webb, you become part of a community designed for you and by you. our boarding and day high school (9–12) fosters independence and nurtures smart, curious, and independent minds. community is our most valuable resource, helping students grow, develop a strong sense of self, and act with honor and moral courage. join us and discover your potential!
	


it's so much more than a school!












lifelong friendships
"i just love that there are so many different kinds of people that you can meet and so many different opportunities to hang out and get to know them better."webb is a place where you can make everlasting friendships and meet people you would never have met otherwise. the teachers and the entire community are supportive of all different kinds of people and situations."– sakeena h. ’27












the perfect location
"webb's location is very good for two things. "#1 is nature. our campus has many trees and nature, which makes for a very, very beautiful campus with a lot of green all around. it's very nice to walk around the campus."#2 is that we are in southern california, the perfect place for students to hang out or find things to do. right on campus, there are trails in the foothills where you can run or walk. claremont village is close by. webb’s in the perfect place as it's close to everything: the desert, the mountains, the beaches, los angeles."– michael a. ’26












boundless possibilities
"i'm most proud of my accomplishments on the wrestling team. before i came here, i would have never thought that i would join wrestling or, honestly, any sports team because i wasn't such a sports person before i came here."the wrestling team has really allowed me to be open-minded and try new things because i feel like a lot of people don't. people don't know what they can accomplish unless they try it first. i think i was doubting myself too much before i actually came here. and because of how inclusive and supportive people are here, it just gives you the confidence to try new things."– sandy l. ’27












a global community with outstanding support
"the coolest part of being at webb for me is seeing all of these different people from all around the globe, seeing how different we are, yet we’re here in the same place at the same time, living and learning together.  i think it's so neat that i'm able to connect with people who are not like i am, who come from a different background, who have different opinions, and who want to hear what i think and talk about why we each believe what we believe."it's really impressive how much support we have at webb, especially since so many of us are so far from home, including people from all around the world. there are support groups here for everyone, no matter who you are or how you identify."– gavin h. ’27












engaged community
"first and foremost, i would describe webb as a community. the community between faculty and students is really special. small class size (which is why i chose to come to webb), boarding life, and all of the opportunities available to us on campus—all make up the webb community."– brianna s. ’26












boarding
 "my favorite thing about webb is the community as a whole, but specifically, it's the dorm community. i'm a prefect, so i’m in a leadership role in the dorm. boarding has given me experiences and relationships with faculty, students, and people in different grades that i never would have had otherwise."being in the dorm is a great, great way to create a community that doesn't feel so, i guess, forced. it's really like a happy, nice, kind environment full of people that have similar backgrounds and some that have very different backgrounds than you. so you learn how to relate to many different people."– lucy t. ’26
