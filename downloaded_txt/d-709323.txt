three generations ofexpert jewelerswhether it signifies a first love, a new love, or lasting love, or simply success along the way, we think every piece of jewelry tells a story. it helps us celebrate life events, reminds us of those we love, and rewards our accomplishments — big and small. fine jewelry lasts a lifetime, and is often handed down from one generation to the next. at joe escobar diamonds, we too have a story to tell, one more than 40 years in the making, and one that has passed from one generation to the next.learn more
















full range ofjewelry servicesour service department is unparalleled with six master jewelers in our campbell, california location. you can be assured that your piece of fine jewelry will be as pampered on the bench as you will be in the showroom. we can perform something as simple as polishing and cleaning, to something as complex as a complete restoration of a piece of vintage jewelry. our shop uses the latest in technology including jeweler’s microscopes for extremely detailed craftsmanship, and a laser welding machine which enables repairs that are not possible using traditional jewelry repair methods.learn more
