fire science program funded research to understand the links between soil moisture and
wildfire in grasslands.
 
welcome!

welcome to the home page for the oklahoma state university soil
physics program. here you can learn about our research and teaching
activities and access information related to the discipline of soil
physics.
 
program mission and focus:
our mission is to help people better understand and appreciate the
soil, the soil water balance, and the surface energy balance so that we
can more wisely manage and conserve the land and water with which we
have been entrusted. our primary focus is on multi-scale soil
moisture monitoring and improved utilization of soil moisture data in
agriculture, meteorology, environmental modeling, and drought
adaptation.

web-based products from our group:
rain or shine -- an introduction to soil physical properties and processes: an open-access, introductory, multi-media, soil physics textbook by tyson ochsner. please email feedback to tyson.ochsner@okstate.edu.http://soilmoisture.okstate.edu/: automated soil moisture mapping system producing daily, 800-m resolution maps of soil moisture at three depths across the entire state of oklahoma.http://canopeoapp.com/: homepage for free ios, android, and matlab apps that can be used to rapidly and objectively measure percent green canopy cover in digital images.group youtube channel:  homepage for educational, soil physics-related videos developed in our group.oklahoma drainage maps:  webpage displaying annual and long-term average maps of estimated drainage rates at a soil depth of 60 cm.
