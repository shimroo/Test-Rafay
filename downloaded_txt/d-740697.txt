        thank you for a phenomenal trip! it was so well planned by img and so well executed... summiting and camping out on the glaciers was the highlight of my year, and maybe even my life :-). thank you for delivering on this trip, especially during covid. i had so many concerns and fears prior to the trip, given the pandemic, and img did everything they could to alleviate those worries and provide a safe environment for us. i just can't put into words how thankful i am for this trip of a lifetime.
        
~jessica m.



        nothing was overlooked.  safety was always a top priority, and no shortcuts were allowed.  and if i didn't immediately recognize this, the contrast couldn't have been more apparent as we moved up the mountain.  i was so glad to be an img client.  i don't want to criticize other services, but there really is a world of difference, and it's worth every penny!
        
~robert m.



        i pay for the expertise, but i hope for a complete experience — i got it all...  i can safely say i won't climb with any outfit but img.
        
~jeff m.
