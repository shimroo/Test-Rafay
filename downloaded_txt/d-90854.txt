(i believe only hoehlenausgaenge only remains to be translated of his big books.) just as much are the two new volumes of myles burnyeat’s papers, particularly the third’s extensive treatment of the republic, in particular the long “plato on why mathematics is good for the soul,” which marshals the best explanation i’ve read for just why studying pure, unapplied mathematics was so important to plato (and why it is still important today). it’s a brilliant essay. and catherine wilson’s book is one of the best on kant i’ve read in some time and is as strong as the rest of her work. the readability of the world (signale|transfer: german thought in translation) blumenberg, hans (author), savage, robert (translator), roberts, david (translator) cornell university press and cornell university library kant and the naturalistic turn of 18th century philosophy wilson, catherine (author) oup oxford explorations in ancient and modern philosophy: volume 3 burnyeat, myles (author) cambridge university press explorations in ancient and modern philosophy: volume 4 burnyeat, myles (author) cambridge university press later stoicism 155 bc to ad 200: an introduction and collection of sources in translation (cambridge source books in post-hellenistic philosophy) inwood, brad (author) cambridge university press plato's second republic: an essay on the laws laks, andré (author) princeton university press the kingdom of darkness: bayle, newton, and the emancipation of the european mind from philosophy levitin, dmitri (author) cambridge university press merleau-ponty's phenomenology of perception: on the body informed (modern european philosophy) mooney, timothy d.

(the elkins book is frustrating for exactly this reason.) i enjoyed geuss’s quasi-memoir precisely because he permits himself the sort of doubt and irony that seemingly spell career suicide for junior faculty. imaginary languages: myths, utopias, fantasies, illusions, and linguistic fictions yaguello, marina (author), butler, erik (translator) the mit press the south: jim crow and its afterlives (jacobin) reed jr., adolph l.
