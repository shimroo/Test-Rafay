southeast fisheries management and marine life protection
learn about noaa fisheries' work in the southeastern united states, gulf of mexico, and caribbean sea.

the southeastern united states is home to the largest concentration of saltwater recreational fishing in america. whether seeking iconic fish to catch for sport or for sustenance, recreational fishing in the southeast generates more than $15 billion in sales annually. more than 4.5 million fishermen take more than 36 million fishing trips here every year.the commercial fishery represents the second largest by volume in the united states and the third largest by landings revenue. covering a vast area from texas to north carolina and the u.s. caribbean, the southeast has the largest wetland acreage and the largest coral reef track in the contiguous united states. it provides the only known calving grounds for the highly endangered north atlantic right whale. right whales travel here in the fall to give birth off the eastern coast of florida.right whales aren’t alone though—bottlenose dolphins, sea turtles, a variety of corals, sawfish, rice's whales, manta rays and gulf, shortnose and atlantic sturgeon are also residents of our region. this variety creates unique viewing opportunities, experiences, and even challenges for those living in and visiting our region.together, noaa fisheries southeast regional office and southeast fisheries science center work to protect our marine life and their habitat, offering sound science to help inform management decisions in an ever-changing environment.sign up to receive our southeast fishery bulletins for information about upcoming and current fishing regulations.

southeast marine life and ecosystem science
the southeast fisheries science center supports the sustainable management and conservation of marine life. find scientific reports and research program information.

our scientists at the southeast fisheries science center produce data, information, and advice that serves as a foundation of knowledge upon which living marine resource managers in the southeastern united states depend. our science is used to make informed decisions for maintaining healthy marine ecosystems, productive and sustainable fisheries, restoring depleted populations and damaged habitats, and recovering populations of protected, threatened, and endangered species.

habitat conservation in the southeast


southeast habitat conservation and restoration resources
we conserve southeast habitats to boost fish populations, recover threatened and endangered species, and support communities. find information on our programs.

our habitat conservation efforts center around protecting, conserving, restoring, and creating habitats and ecosystems vital to maintaining sustainable populations of recreationally and commercially important fisheries and the recovery of threatened and endangered species. working with state and federal regulatory and permitting programs, we attempt to minimize the loss of coastal waters and wetlands while successfully enhancing and restoring fishery habitats and accommodating sustainable development.regulatory programs do not address the full spectrum of conservation challenges nor do they provide all the tools needed for comprehensive habitat conservation. we also participate in a variety of programs to enhance, restore, and create fishery habitats across the southeastern united states.partnerships are important for protecting and conserving aquatic habitat while continuing to provide ecological and economic benefits. new conservation challenges (e.g., climate change, prolonged droughts, and population growth) require engagement from the broader stewardship community. we work with a variety of partnership entities comprising various federal, state, local, private, and non-profit groups
