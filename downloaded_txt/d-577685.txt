  public notice of notices of electronic (nef) filing scam.
there has been nationwide reporting of fake notices of electronic filing (nefs) being sent to attorneys and law firms across the country. these fake nefs are phishing attempts to convince recipients to respond back to the emails. once a recipient replies to the email, they are sent a follow-up email containing a link to access a document that leads the user to a malicious website. please take caution if you receive these fake nefs, validate cases and case documentation through cm/ecf only, and not to download any attachments or click any links from unofficial or questionable sources.
