methods




about our methodbecause the majority of people have no reaction to bed bug bites, it can be difficult and costly to determine when there are live bugs present. the traditional method of detection is using trained technicians who visually inspect for bed bugs and their evidence. it has been proven that a trained canine's accuracy rate is significantly higher than even the best trained technician due to a olfactory system that can detect scent molecules in the parts per trillion.
it takes a trained pest control professional several hours to visually inspect a site for bed bugs and it can often require the moving of items and dismantling of furniture. even after all that hard work, visual evidence can be very difficult to find. the complete life cycle of the bed bug is "cryptozoic" or living in concealed places, and their survival depends on their ability to find and hide in any crack or crevice. an inspection provided by a scientifically trained and nesdca certified bed bug detection canine is the most accurate tool available, is non-invasive and is performed in a fraction of the time of a traditional inspection.
through the use of scientifically trained canines, good night sleep tight is able to efficiently locate the presence of live bed bugs in almost any environment. average size hotels room can be inspected in just minutes, allowing our teams to cover large areas in much less time than a human inspection.
because of the accuracy of our canine detection, we can pinpoint the exact location of bed bugs. this means treatment can be applied to the precise area of the problem without having to treat an entire site. knowing exactly where to focus remediation efforts is the first step to successful and 5efficient eradication.
the prevalence of bedbugs in the united states is increasing quickly and with no indications of slowing down. unfortunately, no place is bed bug proof. vigilance by all is a prudent practice. partnered with education, a proactive approach can help avoid a few bed bugs from turning into an infestation. when bed bugs are even suspected as being the problem, our trained and certified canines are just the solution you need.

mission




our mission statementas president of good night sleep tight, i personally want to thank you for taking a minute to read about who we are as individuals and the relationships we each have with our four legged partners.
every story differs slightly from the next, however they all end with the realization that dogs are much more than just dogs. while i have been around dogs longer than i can remember, my own moment came 5 years ago with a yellow lab named emma. she was my grandparents dog, often found near any sunny part of the house doing what she does best, lounging.
my grandfathers dementia had progressed very steadily and very rapidly. within months, it seemed like his entire memory had been wiped clean, except for two things - his wife and the path he and i had walked with every dog he ever had.
the call came at 1 am, my grandfather had been missing for several hours. police, search and rescue, along with the fire department where already looking when i arrived. i did not join the search. for reasons i still do not know, i bypassed everyone, the police, the firemen, even my grandmother, and went directly to emma the dog, his dog. i said two words "where's grandy?" and opened the front door. within 5 minutes, she located him trapped in a crawl space under a neighbours front porch, bleeding severely from a large laceration that would have eventually killed him. countless people had unknowingly passed within feet of him. his dog saved his life.
little did i realize how that night would shape my future. the right people at the right time eventually led me to pepe peruyero and a rescued beagle named dino. they are the foundation that our company is continuing to build upon every day, 4 paws at a time. the values necessary in achieving a great canine team are indeed the same values needed to operate a company the only way we know how, the right way. we must lead with love and truth, unselfishness and loyalty. each and every day, i learn something new from our dogs. often, it is something that's easily applied to life and my fellow man. i am simply thankful that dogs exist, and i am humbly aware of how much less a human i would be - how less a person - if they did not exist.
we realize the importance of a company's commitment to quality, professional personnel, proactive programs and innovative solutions. we will always strive to be part of your solution.
our mission, our promise is simple: do one thing, do it with honesty, do it with integrity and above all, do it with our clients best interests at the heart of every decision. every time.
be well,
jason webeck

testimonials




what people are saying about us"after a year or so of repetitive and expensive bed bug treatments from a local exterminator, my daughter was still getting bites from the bed bugs. we figured that they were still somewhere that the chemical spray was not reaching. i saw an article in my local newspaper about a bed bug sniffing dog named dino, and his handler jason from good night sleep tight, that could locate the exact locations of the bed bugs in your home.
polite and professional, dino sniffed every room and gave the alert to several spots where the bed bugs still were. one particular spot was behind the headboard in my bedroom (a room that we did not know there were even any bed bugs) and inside the screw hole in the bed frame. jason marked all of the spots that dino alerted of the bed bugs and i immediately called the exterminator to treat these spots right away. dino was right on, i used a q tip with vicks on it inserted into the screw hole and there the little devils adhered to the q-tip.
without dino, we never would have found the places we needed to treat and solved our year long issue!" - john m, pittsburgh, pa

inspection




inspection overviewwhether it is a one bedroom efficiency apartment or a million square foot office building, the good night sleep tight canine teams are capable of providing superior inspections to fit each of our client's needs. while there is nothing more capable than the canine nose, clients do need to understand the nature of the process in order to receive the most accurate and effective inspection possible.
canines do not find bed bugs visually; the entire inspection is done with their noses. the dogs develop a "scent picture" of their environment with the odors available and alert their handler when they detect the odor of live bugs or viable eggs. in order to do this, the scent must be available to the dog. this holds true in absolutely any environment and is imperative for a successful search.
clients are often surprised by how noninvasive the canine search is. the typical search pattern is around the perimeter of the room, then around the perimeter of objects in the room and up onto objects if necessary. having good access to all areas to be inspected results in a very accurate inspection.
safety is a top priority, both for our canines and our handlers. any type of chemical application, either by a pest control company or by the homeowner, will require a 28-day waiting period before a canine inspection can take place. objects that could be harmful to either canines or handlers cannot be accessible.
good night sleep tight has extensive experience with many types of clients, especially those in the health care field. our capabilities extend to most locations in north america and include single team canine inspections along with multiple team canine inspections. our clients can rest assured our professional, discreet teams arrive prepared to exceed your expectations.

detection




why canine detection? our services are:accurate and sensitive, the nose knows. while we have yet to fully determine just how capable the canine olfactory system is, we do know how capable it is compared to human technology. the united states federal government spent 6 years and 19 billion dollars testing technology designed to detect explosives compared to canine detection. the victor? a dogs nose. it takes much less time and money for our canines to prove their god given talent for our clients.
safe and clean. according to a new center for disease control report, exposure to insecticides used to control bedbugs led to one death and more than 100 illnesses between 2003 and 2010. excessive use of insecticides can raise the potential for human toxicity. good night sleep tight offers a 100% green service. we leave paw prints, not chemicals.
less expensive. canine detection is cost effective and can reduce remediation efforts and pesticide application. why pay to treat your entire facility when you can isolate and treat the infested area? this will decrease the amount of cost and effort exerted in treatment, while saving time and preventing unnecessary treatment in areas that are not infected.
proactive. through canine detection you can be proactive with regular inspections of your property. by maintaining regular inspections you can prevent client complaints or legal action which can lead to financial loss. this could in turn reduce liability, litigation and fraud.
fast. our canines can inspect a room in minutes, and can cover whole buildings quickly. human technicians take much longer to inspect a site as thoroughly. we are available when you need us, with as many dogs as you may need. canine inspections can eliminate areas of non-infestation and expedite treatment.

bugs




how do bed bugs reproduce?a female bed bug only needs to mate once in her lifetime. she is then capable of laying up to 500 eggs, or about 5 per day. after the eggs are laid, it only takes 6 to 20 days for them to hatch. a single female bed bug can increase to over 5,000 bed bugs in just six months.
what does a bed bug look like?adult bed bugs are almost 1/4" long (about the size of an apple seed), brownish and paper thin and have a flat oval shaped body enabling them to hide in literally any place that they can wedge their bodies into.
the nymphs are a miniature replica of the adult but straw-colored and all but microscopic. they are slightly larger than a pinhead.
the eggs are white and difficult to see on most surfaces without magnification. individual eggs are about the size of a dust speck. when first laid they are sticky causing them to adhere to surfaces.
how do bed bugs survive?bed bugs are extremely resilient and the adults can survive up to a year without feeding. this is one reason why infestations are unlikely to diminish by leaving the premises unoccupied. while mainly active at night, they bite people while they are sleeping. attracted to their host by heat and carbon dioxide, they feed by piercing the skin with an elongated beak through which they draw blood. engorgement takes about 3 to 10 minutes, yet the person seldom knows they are being bitten. immediately after feeding they crawl off and reside elsewhere to digest their meal. in 3 to 5 days they will begin searching for another meal.
how do i know if i've been bitten?symptoms after being bitten vary with the individual. around 70% of people have no reaction to being bitten by a bed bug, while some people will have a severe, immediate reaction. symptoms are extremely similar to that of a mosquito bite. bites will increase as the bed bug population rises. often multiple bites will appear in "rows" on exposed areas, such as the neck, face, arms and legs.
where do bed bugs live?bed bugs prefer to hide close to where they feed. however, if necessary, they will travel to obtain a blood meal. for a small insect, bed bugs can move rapidly over floors, walls, ceilings and other surfaces. initial infestations tend to be in areas around beds, but the bugs eventually may become scattered throughout the environment, occupying any item that provides access. they can hide in extremely small cracks and crevices making it difficult to locate breeding sites. bed bugs may also spread to adjacent rooms or apartments.
how do bed bugs spread or travel?it often seems that bed bugs arise from nowhere. the bugs are efficient hitchhikers and are usually transported on luggage, clothing, beds, furniture and other items. this is particularly a problem for hotels, dormitories and apartments where turnover of occupants is constant. bed bugs can survive, and thrive, in any indoor environment that people occupy for any reason. once introduced, they often spread throughout a building. the bugs travel from room to room or floor to floor either by crawling or via a person. the level of cleanliness has little to do with most bed bug infestations. pristine homes and apartments have plenty of hiding places and an abundance of warm-blooded hosts.
how do you get rid of bed bugs?exterminating an infestation requires persistence and the services of a professional.

bites




bed bugs bitesbed bugs are masters of the sneak attack. the manner in which they feed is unnoticed by most people until long after they have eaten and scurried back to safety. the mouthparts are shaped into an elongated, needle-like proboscis that injects an anesthetic so you do not feel the bite and an anticoagulant so your blood will flow freely. they feed rapidly, becoming engorged with blood in less than ten minutes. bed bugs need blood meals to molt and reproduce.
bed bug bites can be hard to diagnose, they can look like any other insect bite and sometimes do not show up until days after. usually there is an allergic reaction to the bed bugs saliva that produces a colorless wheal or lump. discomfort, including itching, burning, swelling and inflammation may last a week or more. other symptoms of bed bugs bites can include insomnia, anxiety and emotional distress.
bed bug bites affect each individual differently; some people show no signs of being bitten. other people may be allergic to the bed bug bites, reacting adversely to the bites immediately with enlarged bite marks and painful swelling. on rare occasions, anaphylaxis may occur.
the bite marks may be random or in a straight line. occasional and few bite marks often indicate a light presence of bed bugs. as the population of bed bugs reproduces and grows, the frequency and the number of bites will increase.
despite the fact that the bed bug can acquire many human blood borne pathogens during feeding, there have been no documented cases of disease transmission as a result of bites. secondary skin infections are common because scratching the bite site often breaks the skin, introducing bacteria and requiring medical attention. the best way to treat a bite is to avoid scratching the area (especially with unwashed hands) and applying antiseptic and/or antihistamine creams or lotions. an oral dose of antihistamine will also relieve bite symptoms.

tips




bed bug tips for travelersconcerned travelers may want to get in the habit of checking their hotel room for signs of bed bugs. this practice would entail examining the bed sheets and upper and lower seams of the mattress and box springs, especially along the head of the bed. do not limit the search to just the bed. dressers, picture frames and desk chairs are often likely harborage spots. some professionals also suggest removal and examination behind the headboard, which is a frequent hiding place of bed bugs in hotel rooms. headboards are heavy and cumbersome, however, and an untrained person should not attempt removal themselves.
if bed bugs are discovered, travelers should request another room, preferably in another area of the building. if possible, try to capture a live specimen to show the hotel management.
vigilant travelers should elevate suitcases off the floor on a luggage stand, tabletop or other hard surface. never place a suitcase on a bed. refrain from placing clothes in dressers unless protected in sealed plastic bags. when returning home from a trip, do not take your luggage inside your home. place all clothing (even unworn clothing) in the drier on the hottest cycle possible for at least 30 minutes prior to washing them. inspecting or vacuuming luggage upon arrival home is less useful since it is hard to spot bed bugs inside a suitcase. if a suitcase is infested, it can either be treated or discarded. light colored bed sheets will show signs of bed bug activity more readily than darker colors.
