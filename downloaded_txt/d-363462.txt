news about french and indians wars

we are still making this range of figures to the same scale as before. we have learnt a great deal from the first series and our new range of indians and scottish troops grows apace.

indians have more action poses than before. many will be firing bows, still a popular weapon due to speed and silence, also ideal for setting buildings on fire, as one of our sets will show.

our scottish troops will be the 42nd highlanders, black watch, in various action poses.

we hope you enjoy this new range of figures as much as we enjoyed creating them for you.
