►insurance for dance teachersemployers liability insurance
 
as an employer, you are breaking the law (with a few exceptions) if you fail to take out employers liability insurance. you might employ other dance teachers who supplement your services or who simply co-opt in under your banner for your busy classes.

 
do not overlook other helpers who you might initially consider to be too casual or part-time to warrant serious noteworthiness. do you utilise the help of anyone who takes money for classes, serves break-time refreshments, drives your minibus to dance competitions or assists you with music or costumes (even if paid “in kind”)? if the answer is yes, then you have a team of employees.

public liability insurance
 
your public liability insurance does much the same thing as your employers liability, but it specifically takes care of claims made by anyone else who is non-staff. indemnity levels generally cover claims for damages and injuries made by your customers, members of the public, suppliers or any other third party. it is not legally required, but highly recommended.
