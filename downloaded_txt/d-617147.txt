fantastic company! from start to finish they made what is already a stressful process (moving from atlanta to nw france) as smooth as possible. i got a lot of hand holding starting with john bonney then karlee tucker on the us side and finally kate krasilnikava on the french side. because of my location i needed a van shuttle team to meet the container driver in the local village all arranged by kate.  they were also top notch. everything was exactly as it was packed, nothing broken, nothing missing. not that i will ever move across an ocean again but if i did i would 100% use them again & have already referred to others!

i had to transfer household items from germany to california, partially fragile, and including two very delicate, handmade wooden items that have a high emotional value to me. upakweship took excellent care of my items. i got updates throughout the journey of my items which i highly appreciate. very friendly communication! my boxes arrived two days ago. nothing is broken and i could not be happier! i have to add that i shopped around for quotes before i decided on upakweship and found their quote very reasonable. there were no hidden fees or costs that were not included in their quote. highly recommend!

i connected with upakweship through the irish move group. people wrote highly of the service and value for shipping household & personal items from us to ireland. ocean freight is by far the economical approach. alicia hawkes repeatedly noted for her excellent customer care.

john b provided guidance and quotes, with alicia managing follow-up. i sent 4 pallets of old family furniture, art, books, various other items that i wished to keep. everything went seamlessly, exactly as promised, from one coast to another, across the pond to rotterdam, then delivered to my door in dublin.

very grateful.

our family used u-crate for sending pallets to europe 4 times. they updated us by email whenever the pallet moved. they arrived intact every time. 5 stars for the help, customer service and shipping service.

the company is outstanding. i picked them because i saw several good reviews online, and was pressed on time. i selected the u-crate and they helped me coordinate my shipment from us to europe. alicia was phenomenal on the us side, getting me set up with documentation and ready for the shipment. the crate arrived, i filled it and the shipment was picked up from my driveway with no issues.
elda was wonderful on the european side, keeping me updated about my shipment and answering all my questions in a prompt manner. i received my shipment in about two months. i received it the way i shipped it, and everything was in tact. it was delivered curbside, with zero issues.
i am so grateful to all the wonderful employees of upakweship, they were professional, friendly, and diligent! i highly recommend the company to anyone who is making a move!

we used upakweship for a full service move from ireland to the us. had a great experience with their uk based customer service team who oversaw the outbound shipment etc. it did take a bit to get our stuff, but that was due to a busy/clogged port in ireland rather than upak. every time i followed up, they chased the issue and got back to us with a reply quickly. no more international moves for us thank god (lol) but would use them again!

we have been very happy with our experience shipping our belongings again a second time across the atlantic. this time was door to door with upackweship. we were given status info along the way and are happy to see everything arrived in great condition. drivers that did pickup in portugal and delivery in texas were both courteous and helpful.

absolutely satisfied! and delighted by the support they provided and view into where my pallet was. it was fast, efficient and relatively easy. the only hard part was limiting our stuff! but we got everything in. using a ladder to drop soft/light things over the top when it was nearly full. the various agents who connected with me were professional, clear and concise. i'd use them again in a heartbeat!

great company to work with, both in europe and the usa.  our goods were picked up october 9 and delivered in the usa december 9. we received notifications to let us know where our goods were in the process.  highly recommend if you are moving to/from europe.

     december 11, 2024 

we recently moved from utah, usa to luxembourg using the 20ft container option. it took about 6 weeks from the time we loaded the container to the day it arrived at our new home. it could have been as short as 4 weeks but the boat departure/arrival timings didn't perfectly align with our moving dates.

the container was a bit dirty, but because we wrapped and covered everything thoroughly it wasn't a problem. there was no damage to any items. definitely recommend reading/watching their packing tips. they have a lot of resources and people available to help which i greatly appreciated.

everyone we worked with was very friendly and kept me up to date at every step. every question i sent was answered promptly with plenty of detail so i felt comfortable all at times.

i would use their services again.

rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)

i recently had the pleasure of using upak / we ship for my household goods shipping, and i can confidently say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. moving can be incredibly stressful, but the team at upak / we ship made the process seamless and hassle-free.

from my first inquiry, the customer service team kate and her dad were responsive and knowledgeable. they patiently answered all my questions and provided detailed information about the shipping process, pricing, and timelines. it was refreshing to speak with the both of them who genuinely cared about our needs and made sure we felt supported throughout the process.

the pricing was transparent and competitive compared to other companies i researched. there were no hidden fees, and the quote i received was accurate, allowing me to budget effectively for our move. i appreciated the option for different service levels, which helped me choose a plan that fit my needs without breaking the bank transporting our household goods to germany.

on the day of the move, the driver arrived on time and came well-prepared.

**delivery:**
the delivery was prompt, and my items arrived in perfect condition. the team at my new location in germany was just as professional and helpful as the initial crew. they unloaded everything quickly and even assisted in placing my furniture where i wanted it, which made the settling-in process much easier.

**overall experience:**
i highly recommend upak / we ship for anyone looking to ship household goods. their professionalism, attention to detail, and commitment to customer satisfaction truly set them apart from the competition. moving can be daunting, but with upak / we ship, you can rest assured that your belongings are in good hands. i wouldn’t hesitate to use their services again in the future!

thank you, upak / we ship, for making my move a breeze!

absolutely satisfied! we used the u-crate service and got our pallet within 2 months! (from utah, usa to cologne, germany). no damages, no extra fees - everything went great. the customer service was excellent too; fast and friendly.
we would use this service again and will definitely tell our friends/family about it. 😊

wow! when they say they deliver, they mean it. we transported our belongings to their warehouse on 04/04/2024. we then waited for our final visa approval from the italian consulate. we stored our belongings at their warehouse in south carolina while we waited. we got our visa back on 9/3/2024. our items were then shipped to us here in italy and they arrived on 10/22/2024 (about 3 weeks after we arrived here with what we could carry) . everything is in the condition we left them with it and it all arrived without any visible damage of any kind. thanks to everyone involved at upakweship! it was a very calm and thoroughly enjoyable relationship. no drama, no hiccups, just great service and quick responses to any questions we had. the help we had at the warehouse was wonderful! we are so happy and grateful we decided to use your service.

     october 18, 2024 

excellent experience. great company. on time, efficient, and well-managed, from the very start of the move. we could not be more satisfied. i want to particularly commend james read, the uk and eu manager, who was at all times professional, communicative, and very helpful, making sure that our move from paris happened the very week we needed it. in the us, rebecca bose, the operation manager handling the container with our goods, was beyond amazing and friendly.... constantly communicating with us to let us know the whereabouts of our shipment, making sure to let us know that it passed customs without any problems, and staying on top of the mover who was bringing the goods to our house, until the very last minute. i was truly impressed by how effective, efficient and gracious she was, and to commend her on her excellent customer service skills. last, whether in paris, or in boston, the movers were on time, courteous, and very careful with our furniture. overall, the team made the international move even better than we expected, rendering it as stressless and seamless as possible!  we felt we were in great hands.

upakweship has been so easy to work with. we are utterly satisfied and very glad for their seamless service. we moved from the us to france and they were excellent in every aspect. easy to work with, helpful with all the different steps, keeping us updated with the status of our shipment and respected the timeline. everything was in good condition. we couldn't be more satisfied

i was super impressed with how easy it was to use the u crate service of upakweship. building and packing the crate was explained clearly and simply, and both the european and american liaisons took care of everything else. the price was also fair. no notes, everything was great.

     september 27, 2024 

we had a fantastic experience with upackweship moving a pallet from nc to germany! the whole process was seamless, and we received our pallet exactly two months and one day after it was sent off! the whole pallet was in perfect condition aside from one minor dent in one of the boxes which we were very pleased by. would definitely use this service again!

     september 24, 2024 

so happy with this company. i am no stranger to using shipping and this is a very smooth and painless solution.
professional at both ends, both picking up and delivering at the destination.
we were constantly informed of the progress and door to door from sweden to fl, usa was 3 months. this was only a couple weeks more than predicted, but i think that was due to waiting for the shipping load to be complete with other shipments from rotterdam. no problems going through customs and a competitive price.
again. extremely professional service. i would definitely use them again.

     september 18, 2024 

moving internationally can be an overwhelming experience, and i was naturally apprehensive about letting go of my belongings and entrusting them to a shipping company for such a big move from chicago usa  to porto portugal. however, upakweship completely eased my concerns with their exceptional communication and attention to detail. from the very start, they kept me informed at every step, promptly answering any questions i had and providing clear updates that made the whole process feel manageable. their follow-up was consistent, and i never once felt lost or uncertain about what was happening with my shipment. the way they handled everything reduced my fear and when the delivery was made on time and without any issues, it solidified my trust in them. i would highly recommend upakweship to anyone navigating an international move—they truly made the experience much less stressful. a special thanks to alicia hawk, elda martinez who handheld me through the process. thank you!

     september 7, 2024 

this was a fantastic solution for shipping my personal belongings from the states to france at short notice. after some online searching this really turned out to be the best value for my needs. the crate kit was a great design, worked really well for packing the pallet at home making the best use of space available in the container. it all arrived intact, safe and sound within the timeframe outlined at the beginning. every step of the way i had the necessary guidance and reassurance on the process, so i couldn't have been happier with upakweship's service.

     september 5, 2024 

we just unloaded our upak100, shipped from new mexico to southern italy (almost 3 months door to door). everything was in good condition at arrival. there was a minor problem at the beginning, the packet with the box arrived without the pallet, and it was promptly reshipped. they rely on local companies, so sometimes it might not being their fault for possible problems. they communicated well throughout the shipping process, the boat being used, the customs, the local movers, and we are very happy. the pricing is very competitive for an international moving company, as long as you don't need to ship furniture this is great. they also placed it in our garage, as it was accessible from the road. i read some nasty comments about a tv being broken, honestly this is just not the service for this type of stuff unless you know how to safely pack it. it is a box being held together via fairly strong straps, and we had some extras. it worked great for us, with half of the box being books and the other half being smaller electronics and clothes. i will definitely consider their service again if we have ever to move all our stuff.

upakweship was very communicative and helpful, what we didn't like what the second company they handed off our container to for delivery. although this wasn't the same company we had no say in or control over this second company who was incredibility difficult to work with.

my experience with upakweship so far–because of the superior customer service provided by alicia hawk–has been fantastic! every step of the way, from the initial booking through delivery of our pallet and pick-up of our belongings, she provided guidance and details to keep us informed and on track. alicia has actively stayed in touch all the way through. she is diligent, thorough and a pleasure to work with.
we have every expectation that her colleagues on this side will be just as focused on service. we trust they'll be keeping us up-to-date and that our shipment will arrive safely and as planned. thank you for the peace of mind you provide.

     september 2, 2024 

i used upakweship from south florida to spain for a recent move.  a few things that might be important.  this is not my first long distance move.  i have shipped my things cross country several times but have never moved internationally.  my things were already packed and in storage as i had a long immigration process.  i researched several moving companies but ultimately came back to the first company i spoke with when i began this process, upakweship.  finally, i am very organized 😉

natalie was amazing throughout and communication was clear, accurate and timely.  time estimates given were realistic and i could easily track my container.  i was able to get my paperwork over with plenty of time before it was due.  i found the process to be straightforward, and clear.

once things moved over to the eu i was working with kate.  communication continued to be timely and even though i was super stressed about how my things would look after being on a boat for a month, they arrived exactly as we packed them.  i was shocked.  this is somehow the smoothest move i have ever have and i am so thrilled to have my things here safely with me now in spain.  kate ensured customs documents were in order and my things cleared with no issues.

pricing was more than fair and i already had trusted moving help in the area so for me it was the perfect arrangement.  the driver(s) were lovely and arrived on time.  in spite of how many things can go wrong on an international shipment i am still shocked how smooth this was.  thank you again natalie, kate and john for starting this process off so well for me.  i am forever grateful.  i would use you guys again in a heartbeat.

we found upakweship to be a very effective company with which to work in our move to portugal.  we used the u crate service and found their organization to be especially communicative with clear guidelines, helpful documentation, beneficial updates, and quick responses.  they made a potentially challenging and stressful process quite manageable.

     august 27, 2024 

we used upakweship from california to the netherlands and were so pleased with the service! price and time estimates were absolutely accurate and any questions we had, they were promptly answered by alicia and elda. we were given clear instructions on how to pack which made the process go very smoothly from door to door. everything arrived in perfect condition. i highly recommend them!

     august 27, 2024 

overall we had a really good experience with upak and saved more than 50% on our moving costs compared to a company that packs and ships for you. it might require a bit more work and research but it’s worth it. our account manager kate  was super helpful during the entire operation and all our stuff arrived safely from the us (north carolina) to the netherlands. thanks!

     july 18, 2024 

when my husband and i decided to move to spain we thought we'd have to get rid of most of our things- people all over the internet say it's best to do that rather than pay to move everything, just to move with a few suitcases.  we had some family furniture that we were forbidden to sell so the plan was to leave some things in storage.  one day "just for fun" we decided to research what it would cost to move everything in a 20 foot shipping container- we were shocked at how affordable it is!  so that's exactly what we did, and i couldn't be happier about that decision.  our container arrived in a very reasonable amount of time with everything intact, and cost half of what it cost us to move from florida to the northeast us.  the process was straightforward and upakweship gave great guidance along the way.  i have to give a huge shoutout and my utmost respect and thanks to kate in england, who coordinated our container arrival in spain.  our situation was not exactly straightforward, and kate patiently dealt with unforeseen obstacles, a few flat out mistakes on my part, and was lovely through it all.  customs rules and regulations are complicated, and i am sure i could not have done this without her.  you're the best kate!
i would use this company again and recommend them without hesitation.

we highly recommend the use of upackweship to all.
