          healdsburg one of the best cities in the us

          "tiny healdsburg is one of the most alluring slices of california wine countrya wonderful mix of scenic vineyards, buzzy restaurant openings, and a vibe thats managed to stay breezy and relaxed despite the towns uptick in popularity."

travel & leisure
			  
          this small town (healdsburg) is the jewel of california wine country

"the distinctive year-round destination with just over 11,000 residents   is a true epicurean hot spot with an extremely charming town square,   around which some of its best hotels, restaurants, and shops sit, not to   mention approximately 40 tasting rooms."

it's a great mushrom season so far... 
keep that rain coming (not too much, a bit at a time, just enough)  to bring out those wild mushrooms before the season is over. 
we have two spots available in our mushroom foray & lunch event this sunday, february 16. we are also doing a special version of this experience with the lunch paired with specially-selected siduri wines on sunday, february 23 and they've agreed to open some spots to non-wine club members. if you're interested in this date, please book directly with siduri on tock.

for both of these last events of the season, experienced foragers lead the hike on beautiful private property near healdsburg, sharing expertise and information. after the hike, we regroup for a hearty and satisfying wild mushroom lunch featured at least 8 different types of mushrooms. mushrooms are so fascinating--participants always leave with full minds and bellies. 
we continue to be available for private weekday forays with groups of all sizes while the season is active, so please contact us if you're interested.

we'll be launching some new culinary/food/farm/maker experiences in march, so stay tuned!
