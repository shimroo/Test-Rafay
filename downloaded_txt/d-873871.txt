welcome to elizabethtown first church of god



church housesthe elizabethtown church of god consists of several "houses" that meet weekly for worship, discipleship, fellowship, and service opportunities. houses are the primary way we gather as followers of jesus. the term "house" is borrowed from the traditional english educational system which places people into groups called houses. "houses," therefore, don't refer to the place where people gather, but rather, to the people themselves.



monthly gatheringsall church houses gather at 144 s. market st. on the third sunday of each month for a "gathering of gatherings." these gatherings include teaching, prayer, a time of sharing from each house, music, and food.
