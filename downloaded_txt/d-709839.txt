about eliya:
the eastern long island yachting association is a nonprofit corporation founded in 1981 by a group of dedicated local sailors with a mission to promote sailing on eastern long island waters as well as regional, national, and international amateur sailing activities and competitions.
to accomplish this mission, we have offshore, junior, and one design programs as well as occasional email notifications, and a web site with information about racing dates, results, links to member yacht clubs, and much more.
eliya also promotes and supports race management seminars, rules seminars, cruising weekends, and other educational and safety programs.
your membership in eliya will support our attempts to promote a recreational activity, which is healthy, constructive, and a benefit to the community.
eliya wishes to thank our sponsoring members for their generous support.  we both appreciate and are grateful to you for all you have contributed to sailing on the eastern end of long island.
