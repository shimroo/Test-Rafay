how is the value of a note determined?the value of a note is affected by the down payment, interest rate, payment amount, and term as well as the buyer's credit rating and payment history. the type, condition, and value of the property also impact the value of your note. the time value of money, which makes payments due now more valuable than payments due in 20 to 30 years, also plays a role in the evaluation process. generally, due to inflation, money in your pocket today is worth more now than later. all of these elements will be taken into consideration in determining the current value of your note.
how do i maintain the value of my note?many of the items that affect the value of your note were determined at the time the property was sold. however, keeping good records of the payments received and requiring the buyer to provide annual proof of current taxes and property insurance will help maintain the value of your important asset.
can i sell all or part of my note?we can purchase all or part of your remaining payments. selling part of the payments allows you to receive a lump sum of cash up front, then payments when the note reverts back to you. we can even pay cash for a portion of each monthly payment. many people elect to sell just enough payments to meet their cash needs today and keep some of the future payments as an investment or nest egg. always ask for an option that meets your needs.
why is my note worth more now than ever before?with interest rates down and new buying guidelines, investors are able to pay more now than ever before.
how will selling my note affect the payor?the payor experiences no change in the way the payments are structured. the only change will be the address where the payments are mailed.
how do i get started?to start the process of selling your note to us, we request copies of the documents that were originated at the time of your sale: â» note and deed of trust, mortgage or contractâ» closing statementâ» pay history and current balanceâ» previous title insurance policyâ» current hazard insurance policy we will then give you a firm offer subject to the standard title, appraisal, and buyer's credit review. once under contract, you will receive your cash as soon as all of the documentation can be obtained. this typically takes as little as 10-15 working days.
