welcome to the toys time forgot



 

for more than 25 years we have provided the coolest vintage toys from the childhood memories of our customers. looking for the first appearance of the avengers or black panther, a mego catwoman mint in the box, a 1968 red line custom cougar, or 1977’s charlie’s angels hide-a-way house from hasbro? be it a hot comic book, a hard-to-find action figure, your favorite hot wheels car or the over-the-top playset you never got for your birthday, you can find it at the toys time forgot. don’t think we limit ourselves only to obscure toys. we have all the popular toy lines from the past, too. netflix could have filmed the toys that made us inside our store. our collection spans nine decades. we are where you go to “get your toys back.” and if you don’t see the toy you want on the website, give us a call. if we don’t have it, we can get it.

our honesty policy






for over 25 years we have sold vintage and collectible toys spanning the 1930’s to last week. we understand the last thing you want is an over-graded, low quality toy that you don’t want in your collection. we don’t need the headaches any more than you do, which is why we grade on the conservative side and provide high resolution, unedited photos of the actual toy you are buying. we never use stock images.
since we have a brick and mortar store you will never have a problem getting in touch with us. we provide our name, address and phone number right up front. we know how frustrating it is to purchase something on-line if you don’t believe you can talk directly to the seller.
along these same lines, our privacy policy is straightforward: we do not share your information with any person, any company or any service at any time. it’s that simple. we strive to provide a worry-free online experience for our customers because the only way you’re going to come back and help to keep us in business is if you trust us.

have a toy you would like to sell? we can tell you what it’s worth.



 

it seems everyone has old toys stashed away in an attic, basement, closet or even a storage unit.  if you think it’s time to move on, keep in mind that we are always buying new inventory. you may have something valuable that you don’t want to toss out during a move or spring-cleaning. contact us and we will offer a fair and honest quote.
