we can't do it without you
with your support, the philharmonic society can continue its vision of presenting orange county audiences with the world’s most acclaimed symphony orchestras, chamber ensembles and soloists, while providing an extensive array of free music education programs to students throughout orange county. support







violins of hope
the philharmonic society of orange county is honored to present violins of hope in orange county. violins of hope is a project consisting of concerts, education and community engagements based on a collection of over 80 string instruments owned by jewish musicians before and during the holocaust. all instruments have a common denominator: they are symbols of hope and a way to say, "remember me, remember us. life is good, celebrate it for those who perished, for those who survived. for all people."
father and son luthiers, amnon and avshalom weinstein, own this collection and have restored many of the instruments, some being played by esteemed musicians around the world. each instrument tells a story, and serves as a symbol of hope and rememberance. 
we hope that you can join us for one or more of these events from may 31 - june 10, 2025.  learn more
