a few hours left on cyber monday deals








unsplash-logonynne schrøde

denver peeps still have a little bit of time to cash in on big discounts from local businesses for this season of giving (to yourself). here's a sample of some of our favorite deals, including a few irresistible ones from businesses outside colorado. but hurry. these expire soon.



bonnano concepts venues, including milk market and mizuna: buy a $100 gift card for $60, if you buy before 11:59 p.m. mt today, 12/2/19. it makes it a little easier on your wallet to visit one of frank's food and booze spots.



winter session: get 20% off your order, plus a $25 gift card when you spend more than $100, when you use code monday20 before 11:59 p.m. mt on cyber monday. 



moore collection: there's a lot going on. free shipping on orders over $50 ends tonight, and today is also the last day to use coupon code shopsmall for 25% off.



artifact uprising: get 10% off with code verymerry (with bigger discounts the more you spend) before midnight mountain time today.



deals beyond cyber monday



fetch holiday markets: if you want to go to fetch holiday markets at the old sports castle this month but aren't keen on the $5 fee to get in the door, you don't need a fetch coupon code (but it's broadway). just use this link for free tickets. (sign up the old-fashioned way though—and soon—if you want to receive a $10 gift card to milk market)



5280 magazine: want a free subscription? registering to attend fetch holiday markets earns you a free one



and stuff beyond colorado

capital bikeshare coupon code: if you plan to be in d.c. quite a bit in 2020 for business or pleasure, an annual membership to capital bikeshare can help you get around town emissions-free (besides your own panting). they're offering 30% off annual $85 memberships with coupon code save30, but only today, and we're guessing the deadline is midnight eastern time. this could be a decent gift for d.c. friends too.



megan lee designs: black friday discount codes (to get at least 10% off plus free shipping) are listed on its home page and are good through today. because midwest is best



the information: an annual subscription is half off (savings of $200) if you subscribe on cyber monday. #newsmatters



joe suzuki: if you want to own a joe suzuki piece and aren't picky about which one, he's offering 20% off select items in his shop, today only.



graf lantz: get 30% off on pretty felt bags today with coupon code thanks30. or find a bag on etsy with cyber monday deals that will soon disappear.

joe suzuki | black book gallery











some of joe suzuki's own brand of pop art is in denver this month for a group show at black book gallery. the opening is free and open to the public, 7-9 p.m. saturday, 11/10.
suzuki's trompe l’oeil series of acrylic-on-canvas mashups of luxury logos with affordable luxuries ala starbucks have something to say about status and labels. but his playful, cheeky happy accident series is what first got our attention.





it got even better in october when he posted this beaut on instagram:




"i met ken last year at my daughter's gymnastics meet at the ontario convention center," suzuki wrote. "i recognized him right away but i didn't want to draw attention so i quietly went up to him and told him i was a big fan. he thanked me and wished my daughter good luck. throughout the meet, i saw him cheering for his daughter, often getting up from his seat to get a better view and to take pics of his daughter's performance. i was already a fan but i became even a bigger fan after seeing what a great family man he is."

suzuki's management team says jeong didn't know who suzuki was, but jeong did repost suzuki on his own account.

"i know joe would love to give that piece to ken, but he still has the piece at his studio," says megan on suzuki's team.

the group show featuring some of suzuki's work is called "fake views" and also includes ryan thomas monahan, who is scheduled to attend. monahan's work is the kind that probably needs to be seen in person to appreciate all the details.

see you there.

obvious child





if you've been hoping for more projects from jenny slate beyond marcel the shell with shoes on,  you'll be excited that "obvious child" has been turned from a short into a full-length film starring her.

during a preview screening in downtown denver, the crowd laughed along at just about every joke in this comedy about abortion. yes, a comedy about abortion.

this independent-minded film stands out for its frankness, uncensored comedy and honest, authentic feeling without trying too hard for punchlines. it's also at times sweet, touching and has touches of sadness. it's not just a one-dimensional movie, nor is it all crass, though there will probably be moments when you say, "i can't believe she just said that." the leads, jenny slate and jake lacy, are quite watchable.

this isn't necessarily a movie you have to see in the theater, but it certainly is more fun to watch with all your fellow moviegoers, so you can enjoy the jokes together. no matter what, watch this with a group.
