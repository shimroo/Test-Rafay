knowing god
 















our mission to connect, grow and serve rings true now more than ever, and we are here for you. we believe that god's word gives us the foundation for this journey of faith; that in jesus christ we develop our strongest relationship with god and others. as we weather together the storms of our time, our church remains vibrant and actively serving through our continued mission programs and community care initiatives. we invite you to explore the various ways we may connect with each other, continue to grow in our faith, and serve together.
