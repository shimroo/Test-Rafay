“
                            in today’s turbulent higher education space, we needed more protection at lower rates. we reviewed a number of industry-leading vendors and ultimately elected guidestone. with 30% premium savings on $40 million more coverage, better coverage of some liability gaps, stronger cyber coverage and very responsive claims assistance, we have been very pleased with our ministry partnership.”
