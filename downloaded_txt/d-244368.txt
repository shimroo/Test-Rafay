	 new sweater, new announcement

	 

    


first, a little knitting... 

the new knitty winter 2012 is up with a host of warm winter knits i want to cast on right now, like amy herzog's kittiwake and aileen ryder's fitful head !

there is also a little menswear pattern from me to you: l'argentiere, inspired by ski holidays in the shadow of mont blanc...

















in other news... a big announcement:

the studios at sauveterre design are currently undergoing an expansion and reconstruction project that will continue into the new year. orders will reopen in september 2013. 


in the meantime, we thank you for your understanding, and wish you all the happiest of holidays, and of course, happy knitting ! :)

	 a little something for (indian) summer - introducing 'le cavayere'

	 

    


*whew*hello, all!  i'm just coming up for air: (1) to tell you that i'm still alive (yes, i am!), but busy in the studio and, well, just about everywhere else; and(2) to thank you for your patience, especially those waiting to place orders for klee kits (klee update: there was a technical delay on the batch scheduled for earlier this year, so the ss09 release is now a holiday issue that will launch in november); but most importantly ... (3) to introduce a new mid-season menswear pattern, that i've received several requests for.  so without further ado here is le cavayere.  inspired by a trip to a lake of the same name in the south of france bordered in lush umbrella pines ... ... not far from the medieval fortified city of carcassonne ...... the sweater le cavayere was knit in a new fiber range, a heavenly soft yarn of 100% bamboo called atalante (shown here in colorway pin parasol).  i used to think i was a cashmere knitter through and through, but i have loved working every stitch with this yarn!  in the skein atalante catches the eye with a gentle, beautiful sheen and yields a fabric that feels like his favorite jersey tee shirt, but with such a luxurious hand and such an elegant drape that it would make le cavayere a man's wardrobe staple, something he'll be happy to always have handy to throw on.  le cavayere pattern is us$6.50.  to purchase please send an email to sauveterre at gmail dot com. more details and photos at sauveterredesign.comwishing you all a delightful indian summer and a wonderful week!axelle

	 announcement: the studio is open !!!

	 

    


the renovations are about 98.9999999% complete and although it's a little disorienting getting settled into the new space and working out where things are and how things work... i have to say, gosh it's good to be back !! :)  klee update: the spring batch is coming together and if you're on the notify list, expect an email in the next couple of weeks.fos and projects:  well ... i've been busy working mostly on things i'm dying to but really can't talk about for a while yet.  lots of top secret projects.  (sorry!)  but apart from all the tsps, i did manage to finish a quick spring/summer fo.  a little spring cleaning yielded a cluster of three skeins of colinette tagliatelli in cinnamon that had vanished long ago through the grill of my brain, aka the sieve. :)i think i'd put it aside because the first and last time i knit with it i made a children's sweater, and unfortunately it wasn't quite as robust a fabric as i had hoped.  after a few months (or possibly weeks) of wear and plenty of tear, the sweater ended up looking like swiss cheese.  so, okay, definitely not for your child's play dates.  but for a chic summer top for women, it's just about perfect.  so with only two skeins, 15mm needles, and a project time of just a couple of days from cast on to seaming up, i was able to throw on this little cropped number ...(very little, very cropped)for anyone interested, the pattern is called sandpiper and appears on the cover of colinette's tagliatelle merino tape book.  but a word to the wary: the way the sweater appears on the cover is not how it will look in real life unless you block the **** out of it and/or add more rows to the length and sleeves than in the pattern, which, having a third skein, i could have done, but didn't...really because i think as a cropped textured sweater, it's more fashion forward !!
