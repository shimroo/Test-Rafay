god in the city



current sermon series:



sundays until february 23it’s a brand-new year with a brand-new series of sunday messages! for the better part of 2025, we will be studying the book of acts. we’re breaking up acts into sections, calling the first eight messages god in the city. jerusalem is where it all begins. and through the simple obedience of the first disciples, the holy spirit is turning the town upside down.god in the city brings us into fpc’s mission, values, and three vision mountains. if nothing else, the book of acts is all about the first christians joining jesus to restore and transform one another and the world. it is full of prayer, humility, the grace and truth of jesus, and a lot of courage. it is the beginning of christian communities becoming hubs of healing, investing in new generations, and serving neighbors near and far away.learn with us! the god in the city sermon booklet is available from the sanctuary welcome table on sunday mornings.
