introducing the 




jing 
kids

					after-school program 
and 
					 
camps
the jing institute serves families who need 
					an after-school program for their children, or are looking 
					for a great saturday morning activity; and want their 
					children to learn useful skills for an increasingly 
					multicultural, interconnected, and technological world.

					towards this end, jing offers three pillars of education: 
					cultural-linguistic, physical, and technological-academic.
					

cultural-linguistic: jing teaches mandarin chinese 
					because it is the most common language on earth, because 
					china is a rising global power, and because chinese is a 
					root language for many other asian languages. jing uses 
					chinese songs, games, art, culture, and history to help the 
					language come alive, and help our young students learn about 
					other cultures.

physical: jing teaches its students chinese martial 
					arts (wushu) (also known as kung fu) on the principle that 
					healthy bodies promote healthy minds, and there is no other 
					exercise as healthy and complete as wushu.

technological-academic: jing offers dedicated 
					academic time and help for students to finish their 
					schoolwork (during our after-school program), as well as our 
					own steam (science, technology, engineering, art, and 
					mathematics) program.
