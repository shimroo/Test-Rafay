we just got home from having our second baby and our experience and stay was fantastic! i had a great labor and delivery nurse, mercedes! she was awesome! the staff was great, if i needed something i wasn't afraid to ask. very family oriented and i love that! i felt special. i will definitely come back for all my deliveries!

the nurses, cnas, midwife, anesthesiologist, and dietary staff were professional, respectful, knowledable, and great to work with. i couldn't of had a more positive stay at mvh. i felt the staff always had my wife and newborn's best interests at heart.
