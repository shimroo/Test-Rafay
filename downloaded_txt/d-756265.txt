about dr biddle



i’m a graduate of the university of missouri-columbia in 1989, and i completed my residency in internal medicine in portland, oregon, in 1992. i am board certified in internal medicine and also certified in chelation therapy, hypnotherapy, massage, and reiki. my passion in investigative medicine sees me combing the best of what conventional and cutting-edge medical care have to offer…..and it’s earned me the nickname, “the sherlock holmes of medicine”. i specialize in clinical nutrition, hormones, toxic heavy metals, and hyperbaric oxygen treatments. when i’m not in the clinic i love being with my family and tending to the small plot of land we call home. i have a deep passion for permaculture and sustainability and was part of a community eco-village when i first moved here. check out http://www.earthaven.org to learn more about it.


























for nearly 24 years i have been researching and sampling supplements to provide my patients with what i believe to be the best available nutritional and therapeutic support. and you can access them too, just click below to see what’s available.
