welcome to the hammock shop










 







 


 





 





our story
the pawleys island hammocks story goes back to carolina low country more than 130 years ago. joshua john "cap'n josh" ward, a river boat captain, simply wanted a good night's sleep during the sultry summers. he set out with some rope and wood, a little gumption and grit, and he soon fashioned what would become the basis for our company--the rope hammock--a hand woven bed, two wooden spreader bars, and a clew knot with a ring for hanging the hammocks. pretty simple when you think about it.




 





lil shop o'hammocks
cool and comfortable, the remarkable rope hammock originally designed by captain john ward still soothes and delights all who discover its relaxing comfort. as the first retail store to sell the original pawleys island rope hammock, we continue our long standing tradition of only selling rope hammocks hand woven in the carolinas. to see our hammocks handwoven daily, be sure to visit our weaver’s shed located next to our retail shop in pawleys island, sc.





 

 





handmade glory
meet this hammock maker, a pawleys island original with his own international fan club. he works hard and sure knows how to relax. marvin grant has been delighting crowds at the original hammock shop on pawleys island, sc, for more than 15 years.
      hundreds of postcards from fans around the globe line the walls of the weaver's shed where he works.
      whether marvin's teaching a child how to weave cotton rope, or relaxing in his own hammock at home in nearby georgetown, this animated storyteller always has a smile.
