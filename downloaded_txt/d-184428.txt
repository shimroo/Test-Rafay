since
                  beginning as salisbury coin exchange in july 1979, g.r. tiso
                  numismatics, inc. has belonged to several industry related
                  organizations including, but not limited to: national silver
                  dollar roundtable, ngc, the american numismatic
                  association, and icta.

                  in 1994 came the transition to g.r. tiso numismatics, inc.,
                  and the introduction of third party graded material. g.r. tiso
                  now provides customers with quality assurance and peace of
                  mind in their purchases.

                  the continuing high quality of the inventory we offer is a
                  direct result of our president. gustav tiso travels
                  nationwide, attending all major coin events, hand-picking
                  selections for our clientele.

                  we have been number one in customer satisfaction for  years.
                  we invite you to let g.r. tiso's knowledge and experience
                  provide you with the service you've been searching for in all
                  your numismatic needs.
