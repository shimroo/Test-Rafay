saturday, september 30, 2006dead girl or live boy i see that rep. mark foley (r-fl) has resigned from the house of representatives over sexually suggestive e-mails and instant messages sent to a 16-year-old page.let's get a couple of things out of the way right now. the issue is not rep. foley's sexuality; rumors have been ongoing that rep. foley was a closet homosexual, but homosexuality and pedophilia/ephebophilia are not the same thing. the issue is that rep. foley was sending these ims and e-mails to someone who was (possibly - i've not been able to confirm what the law is in dc) under the age of consent, and that rep. foley was the co-chair of the house missing and exploited children caucus. hypocrisy, if you will.(as an aside, how come no one can spell "hypocrisy" anymore?)he did the right thing by resigning - i will give him that.politically (less than 2 months to the mid-terms; of course we have to discuss the politics of the situtation), the florida republican party can name someone to take his place, but his name will still appear on the ballot. given the circumstances, the democrats might be able to swing another pickup in this formerly safe gop district. tim mahoney is the democratic candidate, and yet another example of why we need to challenge every race.it's also telling that several members of the house gop leadership knew about this several months ago and did nothing.i can hear the clinton haters chorale warming up, so let's refer to point one: monica lewinsky, young as she was, was still an adult. the victim here was sixteen years old. there's a difference between an affair between consenting adults (wrong as it was) and sending dirty messages to a child. my nieces and nephews range in age from six to nearly 19; once they're adults, they're capable of making decisions (erroneous or otherwise), but before that, they're not in a position to give consent. if indeed between seven and nine members of the house gop leadership knew one of their members was sending dirty messages to a sixteen-year-old, and did nothing about it until their hand was forced by the media, that borders on harboring a fugitive. making it even more fascinating is the fact that the lone democrat on the committee that oversees the pages, rep. dale kildee (d-mi), was not notified by the chairman of the committee, rep. john shimkus (r-il). they tried to keep it in house and out of the media, and there were no reprimands or other actions against rep. foley even after they had the evidence.

(as an aside, this is a compelling argument for making sure that wall of separation between church and state stays put.) the jews have been dealing with the same thing for millenia. yes, religion has figured into the martyrdom, but more for the idea of "the other" than the actual acts of the religion.if someone held a gun to my head and told me to recant or die, i don't know what i'd do. the reporters lived, and now can recant the recanting (if they so choose, of course). and while i would be willing to lay down my life for my wife, my friends, my family, my country, and yes, my faith (though in what circumstances, i don't know), i would rather work toward a world where that was unnecessary.

the numbers are the scale degrees, and you can build these modes off any major scale by starting at the given scale degree.ionian - 1 to 1dorian - 2 to 2phrygian - 3 to 3lydian - 4 to 4mixolydian - 5 to 5aeolian - 6 to 6locrian - 7 to 7d dorian is built off the c major scale. on what scale would g dorian be built?(theme from jeopardy! goes here)that's right - f major. dorians are built on the second scale degree of a major scale, and g is the second scale degree of f major.how are these used in jazz? let's look at where we are in jazz history. to this point, jazz has operated under the same harmonic premise as most western art music, using functional harmony. in functional harmony, each chord has a specific role (or function), and the harmony must move to a specific tonal goal (usually the tonic, or keynote of whatever key you're in). this motion is usually by fifths, and operates as follows:ii - v7 - iin english, that means that most phrases end with the chord built on the second scale degree (usually a minor chord), followed by the chord built on the fifth scale degree (a major chord with a lowered 7th), followed by the tonic chord (quality depends on key). chords have function, and rules must be followed. this can be extended out to something like this:iii - vi - ii - v7 - ithat progression is quite common in jazz, appearing (in a slightly modified form) in the bridge to "i got rhythm" by george and ira gershwin, and in other tunes that use the same chord structure (often referred to as "rhythm changes"). the chords appear in the bridge as shown here (in the key of bb):d (iii)old man troubleg (vi)i don't mind himc (ii)you won't find himf (v)'round my doorand then the i hits on the downbeat of the final phrase. in the bebop era, these chords were used with all manner of upper extentions (stacked thirds beyond the basic triad of each chord), but the basic motion was still present.when miles davis and others were looking to move in new directions in the early 1950s, they asked the same question that composers from schubert to schoenberg to debussy to copland to stravinsky had asked - why does harmony need to be functional? can't chords and their placement be chosen by color/sound? why does ii have to be followed by v? do we even need all these chords?the response to bebop was to strip away the upper extensions and slow down the harmonic motion, creating a cooler sound (hence the term cool jazz). modes and modal theory offered one such path. modes can be used for improvisation over certain chords. for example, if you have a mi7 chord, you can use the corresponding dorian mode. for a 7 chord (dominant), use mixolydian. for a half-diminished (ø7) chord, use locrian. chords with a #4? lydian. let's look at the miles davis tune "so what" (from kind of blue). the structure is insanely simple:dmi7-------|dmi7-------|ebmi7-------|dmi7-------||8 measures (count to "four" eight times) in each sectionyou can improvise over "so what" using just two scales - d dorian over the dmi7 chord (which is 3/4 of the form), and eb dorian over the ebmi7 chord. if you have a piano or guitar, try it - play and hold the following notes over the given chords.dmi7 - d, f, a, cebmi7 - eb, gb, bb, dbover the dmi7 chord, improvise using d e f g a b c d. over the ebmi7 chord, use eb f gb ab bb c db eb. see? it's easy!one last thought - you can make your improvisations more interesting by playing up notes that differ from traditional major/minor scales. d dorian contains d e f g a b c d; d minor is d e f g a bb c d. play "b", and play it a lot.innovation in modal jazz improvisation can come from interesting rhythmic patterns and also from using scalar ideas (up 2 steps, down one, repeat - make your own!). you're limited only by the prevailing mode - and your imagination.wf// posted by wes @ 9:23 am |||comments (4) | trackback (1)warhol was right and the latest person to get his 15 minutes is john mark karr, who may or may not have killed jonbenet ramsey nearly 10 years ago. now his family is trying to sell the book and movie rights to his story.why? why?anyone who buys this book should forfeit their right to take part in civilized society for at least a decade. i don't say that because of mr. karr's innocence or guilt - that's really irrelevant to this. i say it because we're all cheapened when stupidity and vapidity are rewarded. let's look at the players in this case:(1) the ramseys. they suffered a tremendous loss that no family should ever have to go through (including iraqi families, for the record). yet i still hold them in a certain amount of contempt for taking part in the whole childhood pageant thing. stage parents frighten me - and most likely frighten their kids as well. a child is not a trophy, nor is it a meal ticket.(2) john mark karr. i don't know if he's guilty or not, but from what we've seen in the news, he was obsessed by this case, so it's entirely possible he just wanted to be linked to it in some way. he also liked to marry young (his first wife was 12 or 13 when they married), and engaged in generally disturbing behavior. we shouldn't know anything else other than he was arrested and charged. we don't need to know what he ate on the flight back from thailand, or how many times he went to the bathroom, or what he was wearing. he's not worth that.(3) karr's relatives. rather then engaging in basic human decency and saying "no comment" until the trial starts, they're trying to cash in. this tells me that family is subservient to cash to them. of course, given how karr seems to have turned out, maybe it's best that he be nothing more than dollar signs to them; they obviously screwed him up something fierce.(4) the media. shame on all of you. of all the stories in the world (the middle east, economic problems, midterm elections, ongoing issues with education, etc. - i could go on and on), the big cable news stations spent most of a week "reporting" about karr and his background, and metaphorically digging up jonbenet's corpse over and over and over. and of course, jonbenet footage was always from the most titillating times when she was onstage - we need to feel guilty about our leering, after all, and in order to do that properly we gotta leer some more. there are reasons that the only news i really trust is the daily show (with necn up there as well).(5) us. for not roundly and soundly sending the message that this, while important in terms of solving a crime, should not have dominated press coverage for over a week.through it all, we now all know (against our will and/or better judgment) who john mark karr is. if he's guilty, he should suffer the appropriate punishment, and if he's not, he should be set free. but now he's famous, and in today's world that is all that matters. there is no need to know who john mark karr is, or who paris hilton is, or who richard hatch is, but we all do. fame has superseded all other measures of success. warhol was indeed right.wf// posted by wes @ 9:00 am |||comments (2) | trackback (0)downtown celebration wasn't it great to see all those people downtown last night?more like this, please.wf// posted by wes @ 8:58 am |||comment (1) | trackback (0)wednesday, august 23, 2006nice. behold game over, in which classic video games (we're talkin' early '80s) are re-enacted with foodstuffs and other household items.some people have too much free time. how i envy them.wf// posted by wes @ 10:16 pm |||comment (1) | trackback (0)oy. jeffy, you started out halfway decently, and then you missed the point entirely.the good people at ben gurion airport engage in psychological profiling - looking for behavior patterns, etc - and not racial or ethnic profiling. it's not perfect, to be sure, but it's a far sight better than "hey! he looks swarthy! get him!"but hey, brown people scare you. we get that already. you're really no better than the screaming harpies and pantswetters who pester flight attendants when someone "who looks like one of them" gets on the same plane.furthermore, change "jihadi" to "crusader" and you've hit the likes of paul hill, eric rudolph, tim mcveigh, and operation rescue. last i checked, not a lot of muslims there.wf// posted by wes @ 9:56 am |||comment (1) | trackback (0)kids these days apparently, some teenagers in brattleboro, vt like to get a good all-over tan.two questions:(1) where were these people when *i* was in high school, and(2) anyone want to see me visit brattleboro and take part? no? me neither. believe me - no one hates seeing me naked more than me.wf// posted by wes @ 9:51 am |||comments (5) | trackback (0)tuesday, august 22, 2006open gubernatorial thread whom do you support for massachusetts governor and why?how about new york, for any readers from there?vermont?have at.wf// posted by wes @ 9:37 am |||comments (9) | trackback (0)first in the nation scot lehigh writes a good piece on new hampshire's stubborn refusal to let another state have a say. if they are indeed considering having their primary in 2007, then i never ever want to read a letter from a new hampshire resident complaining about the lengthening presidential campaigns.wf// posted by wes @ 9:30 am |||comments (4) | trackback (0)monday, august 21, 2006slow news day you know it's a slow news day when the top story on yahoo! is something about britney spears' husband.wf// posted by wes @ 8:56 am |||comment (1) | trackback (0)opa! jawa girl and i went down to the grecian festival at st. george's on saturday. good food and good music.wf// posted by wes @ 8:49 am |||comments (7) | trackback (0)sunday, august 20, 2006sunday religion blogging the debate over faith vs. works rages on.obviously, i cannot speak for non-christian religious communities here, but within the christian religions, the balance between faith and works differs sharply from denomination to denomination. st. paul defined faith as "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." (hebrews 11:1, kjv) augustine of hippo believed that faith was the source of all knowledge. søren kierkegaard argued faith was the basis of belief beyond argument, and not something that had to be proven. william sloane coffin defined faith as trust without reservation, not acceptance without proof.within christian beliefs, faith plays a central role - to be considered a christian, one must believe in the existence of god, that this god sent his only son as a sacrifice for our sins, and that this sacrifice is the central act of christianity. there is wide disagreement of just how literal these events were, but the events form the basis of christian faith. most christians further believe that faith must manifest itself in some way that shows the positive influence of christianity. christians refer to this as works. our friends in the roman catholic church have categorized works further into corporal and spiritual works of mercy. protestant and restoration churches do not usually sharply define works in this way, relying more on the general belief that "good works" are necessary for continued salvation.in those churches that practice adult baptism, hearing and believing the gospel - faith - is what leads the hearer to repent and confess their sins and then be baptized - works. some churches believe the moment of repentance and confession is the moment of salvation, and the baptism is merely an outward act triggered by faith. others believe salvation is not granted until baptism. this line of demarcation is what separates the anabaptist tradition from the restoration tradition. furthermore, there is strong debate over the condition of one's soul following initial salvation. those in the calvinist tradition believe that once salvation is granted, it is granted for good, and no amount of works (good or bad) can change it. this belief is drawn from the idea that salvation is a gift of god (which is generally accepted in christian theology) and that once granted it cannot be "un-granted." others, drawing upon the wesleyan and campbellite traditions, believe that salvation, though freely given of god, can be removed if the person does not carry out certain works or if the person engages in sinful behavior. to be sure, even the calvinists do not believe that works are irrelevant - on the contrary, they believe works are a manifestation of the ideals of faith. and also to be sure, good works are not just limited to people of faith - there are many atheists and agnostics who live up to the ideal of "love thy neighbor" to a greater extent than many who claim the mantle of christ.our jewish friends have what is called a mitzvah, which can literally mean a biblical commandment; in a larger sense it can also mean any act of human kindness.what say you on the role of faith versus the role of works in salvation and in general?wf// posted by wes @ 9:39 am |||comments (7) | trackback (0)everyone's a critic shorter this guy: how come no one exhibits dogs playing poker or velvet elvis? and no one paints like that thomas kinkade fella.sir, just because artists are less representational doesn't make them lesser artists. i reserve some of my most vile criticism for contemporary "artists" who are more interested in being ironically detached than actually saying something through their art, but all periods and genres of art produce artists who have something profound to say. and i would never point to a genre or artist (especially one of the greats like cezanne) as being indicative of the "decline" of art. if you believe art begins and ends with representational painting, sir, i'm sure you can find something at your local craft store that is inoffensive to your fragile tastes.wf// posted by wes @ 9:30 am |||comment (0) | trackback (0)and verdi turned 'round in his grave. i see our local johnny one-note is at it again (bottom story) with his tales of woe on how the evil court system is destroying fatherhood.

july 08, 2006





saturday, july 08, 2006a lovely day. mowed the yard this morning, then jawa girl and i took julie the wiener dawg to a plot of land owned by second chance animal center (where jawa girl works) and let her run free while we had a picnic lunch.anything going on today?wf// posted by wes @ 4:11 pm |||comment (0) | trackback (0)friday, july 07, 2006congratulations are in order kudos to dr. steve green, vice president of academic affairs at mcla (and a personal friend) for being named sociologist of the year by the new england sociological association.dr. green is one of the good guys.wf// posted by wes @ 12:57 pm |||comments (3) | trackback (0)friday animal blogging - older cats need love too edition this is romeo.romeo is a 12 year old black and white male cat who is at the second chance animal center because his owner passed away. he is a declawed cat so he needs to be an indoor only cat. he is a very calm, gentle and friendly cat.many people come in to the shelter and look at kittens. and while kittens are very very cute (believe me, miles, ella, and mingus were!), sometimes older cats find themselves at the shelter too. romeo may not have too many years left, and he deserves a nice home as much as any other cat.update: good news! romeo has found a home!wf// posted by wes @ 9:56 am |||comments (7) | trackback (0)thursday, july 06, 2006on the road again... anyone who has known me for, say, 14 seconds or more knows i love me some maps. in the room in which i am typing this there are maps of north adams, berkshire county, massachusetts (by towns), the united states, and the world. jawa girl routinely gives me maps from her subscription to national geographic.probably because of my love of maps and my love of travel, i've become quite interested in roads and how they are maintained. i'm enough of an environmentalist that i'm not in favor of a huge increase in road building, but i do think we should maintain the roads we have.with that said, what do you all think of this idea from joseph m. giglio?wf// posted by wes @ 8:35 am |||comments (3) | trackback (0)bwli good to see the berkshire wireless learning initiative still going strong.a colleague offered some good suggestions with regard to muni wifi. now that things are finally settling down after the wedding, look for a meeting sometime in july or august. (yes, i know - i wanted it earlier too, but life has a way of getting in the way.)wf// posted by wes @ 8:26 am |||comments (12) | trackback (0)wednesday, july 05, 2006pogrom's progress well, now.seems a jewish family was run off from a school district in southern delaware for...being jewish.and what's worse - the slackjaw behind stop the aclu is "pleased we had an effect in this case."the fundamentalists extremists who miscall themselves "christian" are lining up with jews and the state of israel for one reason and one reason only - they believe there has to be a huge battle there before jeeeezus! comes back. at that point, any jew who doesn't convert to their narrow brand of extremist faux-christianity will be killed. why some jewish folks *cough*joe lieberman*cough*jeff jacoby*cough* insist on hanging with these people (whose whole theology requires the jews to give up their jewishness or perish when all is said and done) is beyond me.mr. kareiva of stop the aclu and the citizens and board members of the indian river school district who supported this deserve all the scorn and maledictions civilized people can pour out.wf// posted by wes @ 11:48 am |||comment (0) | trackback (1)music of the spheres ms. hilda banks shapiro of great barrington lets us know that stephanie wilson of pittsfield, currently on board the space shuttle discovery, was an outstanding clarinetist as well.it makes the heart proud to hear stories like that. if you asked astronaut wilson, i'd wager she'd tell you her musical studies had a positive impact on her studies to be an astronaut. this is the sort of thing that cannot be measured by a soulless standardized test designed to appeal to people who don't have clue one about how education should function.further interesting fact: neil armstrong played euphonium (my first brass instrument, for the record) in the purdue university band while in college. mr. armstrong lives in the cincinnati area - i never got to meet him (his teaching days at uc were pretty much over by the time i started work on my mm, and we music majors didn't get out of the music building much), but i always wanted to get a euphonium into his hands and have him join a tubachristmas concert - anonymously, of course.wf// posted by wes @ 11:07 am |||comments (2) | trackback (0)no justice ken lay has died without serving a day in prison. i hope that herculean efforts were used to try to save him, because the thought of ken lay not serving one second of the time due him makes my blood boil.personally, i believe he should be buried in a prison cemetery.and of course, this has to be a relief to bush, because now he doesn't have to think about pardoning kenny boy.wf// posted by wes @ 11:02 am |||comments (6) | trackback (0)tuesday, july 04, 2006the testament of freedom like i did two years ago, i'd like to put up the text of randall thompson's the testament of freedom, a setting of the words of thomas jefferson. it seems right.movement 1 (from a summary view of the rights of british america, 1774):the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy but cannot disjoin them.movement 2 (from declaration of causes and necessity of taking up arms, 1775):we have counted the cost of this contest, and find nothing so dreadful as voluntary slavery. -- honour, justice, and humanity, forbid us tamely to surrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ancestors, and which our innocent posterity have a right to receive from us. we cannot endure the infamy and guilt of resigning succeeding generations to that wretchedness which inevitably awaits them, if we basely entail hereditary bondage upon them.our cause is just. our union is perfect. our internal resources are great...we gratefully acknowledge, as signal instances of the divine favour towards us, that his providence would not permit us to be called into this severe controversy, until we were grown up to our present strength, had been previously exercised in warlike operation, and possessed of the means of defending ourselves. with hearts fortified with these animating reflections, we most solemnly, before god and the world, declare, that, exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which our beneficent creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness and perseverence, employ for the preservation of our liberties; being with one mind resolved to die freemen rather than to live slaves.movement 3 (from declaration of causes and necessity of taking up arms, 1775):we fight not for glory or for conquest. we exhibit to mankind the remarkable spectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation or even suspicion of offence. they boast of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than servitude or death.in our native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it -- for the protection of our property, acquired solely by the honest industry of our fore-fathers and ourselves, against violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. we shall lay them down when hostilities shall cease on the part of the aggressors, and all danger of their being renewed shall be removed, and not before.movement 4 (from letter to john adams, 1821 and a summary view of the rights of british america, 1774):i shall not die without a hope that light and liberty are on steady advance...and even should the cloud of barbarism and despotism again obscure the science and liberties of europe, this country remains to preserve and restore light and liberty to them...the flames kindled on the 4th of july, 1776, have spread over too much of the globe to be extinguished by the feeble engines of despotism; on the contrary, they will consume these engines and all who work them.the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy but cannot disjoin them.wf// posted by wes @ 8:55 am |||comments (5) | trackback (0)in congress, july 4, 1776. (note: light blogging today. do something uniquely american. listen to a sousa march or some jazz. have a cookout. celebrate our 230th birthday in grand style. it's still good to be an american, all of the present regime's best efforts to the contrary notwithstanding.)every year, on july 4, i reread the declaration of independence. you should too.the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america,when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.--that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.--such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.he has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.he has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.he has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.he has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.he has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.he has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures.he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation:for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:for protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:for imposing taxes on us without our consent: for depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offencesfor abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:for suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.he has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.he has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands. he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless indian savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.nor have we been wanting in attentions to our brittish brethren. we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. they too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. we must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.we, therefore, the representatives of the united states of america, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. and for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.the 56 signatures on the declaration appear in the positions indicated:column 1georgia:button gwinnettlyman hallgeorge waltoncolumn 2north carolina:william hooperjoseph hewesjohn pennsouth carolina:edward rutledgethomas heyward, jr.thomas lynch, jr.arthur middletoncolumn 3massachusetts:john hancockmaryland:samuel chasewilliam pacathomas stonecharles carroll of carrolltonvirginia:george wytherichard henry leethomas jeffersonbenjamin harrisonthomas nelson, jr.francis lightfoot leecarter braxtoncolumn 4pennsylvania:robert morrisbenjamin rushbenjamin franklinjohn mortongeorge clymerjames smithgeorge taylorjames wilsongeorge rossdelaware:caesar rodneygeorge readthomas mckeancolumn 5new york:william floydphilip livingstonfrancis lewislewis morrisnew jersey:richard stocktonjohn witherspoonfrancis hopkinsonjohn hartabraham clarkcolumn 6new hampshire:josiah bartlettwilliam whipplemassachusetts:samuel adamsjohn adamsrobert treat paineelbridge gerryrhode island:stephen hopkinswilliam elleryconnecticut:roger shermansamuel huntingtonwilliam williamsoliver wolcottnew hampshire:matthew thorntonwf// posted by wes @ 8:38 am |||comments (4) | trackback (0)love freedom? thank a massachusetts liberal.(props to my buddy and fraternity brother george cullinan for the idea)wf// posted by wes @ 8:33 am |||comment (0) | trackback (0)monday, july 03, 2006by definition unfinished i haven't posted on james carroll's columns in a while, but this one deserves special due. a taste:america is by definition unfinished, because it forever falls short of itself. not that this nation is more moral than others, but its half-formed foundational ideal required a moral purpose at the start -- and a moral purpose to the end. that is both creative and creatively undermining. born in a challenge to authority, american authority continually inhibits its own exercise (what the supreme court did last week in challenging the executive and legislative branches over guantanamo). recognitions of personal alienation inevitably open into demands for the reform of alienating systems -- and in america that is the work of politics. it never stops.as the kids say, read the whole thing.wf// posted by wes @ 8:54 am |||comment (0) | trackback (0)from the rejected poetry desk, middle english edition courtesy of jane, we find this little ditty that apparently didn't make the cut in the canterbury tales:an indian chief, a cowboye and a coppea werkere and a leather manne (a toppe)did marche togedir in fraterniteeal thogh thei were of varyinge lyveree.thei knewe sum auncient magicke remedyefor “y m c a” dide they ful loude crye,and lifte ther armes lyk vnto menne gone woode.and eek yt semede their mappe was nat too goode:thogh canterburye-warde we headede estin unison thei seyde to us ‘go weste.’there simply isn't enough parody poetry out there.wf// posted by wes @ 8:43 am |||comment (0) | trackback (0)sunday, july 02, 2006culture club the globe today encourages the general court to override red speck's veto of $13,000,000 for cultural facilities.good for them.we've seen firsthand here in north adams what an influx of culture-related money can do.
