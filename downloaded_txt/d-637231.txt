our gardens, farms & programs enable all rhode islanders to grow & enjoy healthy food









special thanks to papitto opportunity connection & ian travis barnard photography for creating this video, and to adena “bean” marcelino of black beans pvd and farmers teo and margarita martinez for sharing their stories.





growing food brings southside community land trust in relationship with indigenous people who occupy land across what is now rhode island. we acknowledge our presence on this land, unjustly stolen from the narragansett, pokanoket, and wampanoag tribes. we seek to learn from and support all indigenous peoples, and to repair ongoing harm through our work to increase access to healthy food.
