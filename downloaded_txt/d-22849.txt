dear students, parents, families, and community members,
we are excited to offer activity tickets to support our students and enhance their school experience. these tickets provide a convenient and cost-effective way to enjoy school events without the need for cash at the gate.
benefits of activity tickets:


support student opportunities: proceeds from ticket sales go directly towards funding student activities and programs.


cost-effective: purchasing tickets in advance can save money compared to paying at the door.


convenience: no need to carry cash—simply show your ticket at the event.


please note that due to inflation, there has been a necessary increase in the cost of tickets this year. we appreciate your understanding and continued support.
2024-2025 activity passes:
grades k – 5:  $ 50.00      adult value pass: $60.00/12 punches    
grades 6 – 12:  $70.00   adult pass: $90.00-will admit to all athletic activities during the year
senior citizens pass (65 or older) $10 annually 
 
important: passes must be purchased from the office. only senior citizen passes can be purchased  from the office and at the gate. 
if you would like to get in for free, officials and volunteers are needed.  learn more about being an official at https://www.iahsaa.org/officials/become-one/ .  contact the school to inquire about volunteering. 
thank you for supporting our students and making their school experience unforgettable!
sincerely,
tyus adkins, activities director
matt molumby, secondary principal
rob busch, superintendent

read moreelementary dismissal procedureswc will be adjusting our dismissal procedures to ensure safety and speed up the pick-up process. we have attached a map to help clarify. 
change to take note of:
1- once you pick up your elementary student, please move your vehicle to the jh/hs pick-up line to pick up your ms/hs student on the north side of the school (no further than the cones).
 
2- dismissal teachers are willing to open the door for your child, but if you need to get out and buckle them in their car seat you are welcome to do so. please make this process as quick and safe as possible. 

thank you for your cooperation and for keeping our kids safe!!
