well back to rugby it was.i played last week for the last ten minutes just to get back into the swing of things and scored the winning try!!! whilst arguing with the ref i forgot to put the ball down and someone got a cheap shot in but i managed to hold onto it to score.this saturday we played market rasen. they are usually a really good team so we were ready for a difficultt game. i was starting the match playing at flanker but throwing in at the lineout. i was a bit wary about my eye injury but just got on with it.as it happened i scored in the first 5 minutes!!! we went on to win 21-0 (the scoring is similar to american football).the first try really took the wind out of our opponents sails and we cruised to victory.well at least i did something on the weekend. i am too tired from work and lack of sleep at night to do any kar training and it is killing me. i know these are excuses but this feels very real to me. i need downtime.any way tonight is weights training so i should be motivated. the problem is when i get back home and sit down (after bathing the kids etc.) the last thing i want to do is go back out.the picture is of our opponents (not against us) they are in the red and green.

not much to blog about with regards to kar as i missed training last week (though going tonight).i have got back into my training now after a 4 week hiatus. in that 4 weeks i put on around 8-10 lbs of bad weight!!!!!!!!!this has refoccused me on the task. i have weight trained twice this week now and getting back into eating properly in time for christmas, it is always good to feel better about yourself at christmas.work is an absolute nightmare at the moment so i am unable to devote anywhere near the amount of time i want to my training.having said that i am returning to rugby this weekend. i know it is risky with my eye injury but i miss the conflict and the glory of the win, even the devestation of the loss. playing rugby really toughens you up. you are getting hit from all angles and stamped on when on the floor so you learn to survive and your body hardens to the impact, which is all good for martial arts.let's hope i can stay injury free.

recently i have attended a weekend seminar on kaze arashi ryu. the seminar focused on the use of the naginata this is an exceptionally graceful and effective weapon (though it takes a lot of space up on the battlefield and is only effective in trained hands).hence this is a weapon i am not particularly good at being the oaf that i am.i enjoyed the weekend. it was very long and a huge amount of concentration was required. we would start at 10 am and train through until 4pm. physically it was quite easy but the amount of techniques covered and the time given to each kept the pace very quick and the mental application ardouos.we learnt a bit about the history of kar and some great empty handed moves like how to deal with being in a head lock and we did a few sessions on knife attacks. the knife attacks were continued when we got back to normal training, this is another weapon i find myself growing fond of.the reason for the seminar was that a great instructor and one of the highest level practitioners of kar in the world had come over. his name is villaire sense (sp) he is the darker skinned man in the blue gi in the picture. he had an immense well of knowledge of the art and to learn from him was a great honour.another interesting part of the weekend was the grading of the higher oku iri ranks, in kar you wear the white gi and black hakima but when you pass the black belt stage (oku iri) you are allowed to wear the blue/indigo gi and hakima. the grading was extremely technical and difficult where the people had to show a series of attacks and counters againt 2 armed and unarmed opponents. it was enlightening to see he standard i am aiming for.apart from the training the best element of the weekend was getting to know the guys i train with (and finding out i am the only welsh kar in the world, welsh master therefore) the journey up was puntuated by a stop for a cooked breakfast, cost a bloody tenner but was lovely, though i regretted it at some stages through the day. after a hard days training we went to our bed and breakfast in a neighbouring village. the place was half way up a mountain and almost impossible to find in the pea soup fog, there was much piss taking of the map readers and a good atmosphere when we got to the place run by a lovely old couple who gave up one of their bedrooms and slept outside in a caravan for us.that evening we went into town for a chinese meal and a few beers, more piss taking and general laughter all night, i haven't laughed that much in a long time. we went easy on the beers because we knew we had a hard day ahead of us and got back to the b and b where the spazzy blair witch was recorded and an earlyish night was had.i really began to appreciate the different personalities of the people i train with and got a greater understanding of their motivations in kar. it has made my training sessions more enjoyable as i am more patient with myself and my fellow students as i feel more comfortable in their presence.the picture dispayed is of the member of the club in white gi and the 2 'guest' instructors in the high ranking blue/indigo gi. also the man in the front centre 3 not wearing the blue gi is aberneithie sensei who runs or club.top from left; jason, joe, andy, andy, leightonbottom from left; me, villeir sensei, kirby sensei, aberneithie sensei, chris

                      	 very small sticks
	                       
                          

last night was a very technical session and very difficult. after the warm up we started with some forearm strikes. they are done as an alternative to punches or elbows. each parry was followed by a strike. this in itself was not too bad. however we went onto do kicks and add them to the taisabachi. this was where is became difficult, having to remember a parry, strike and kick times 10. i muddled through as best i could, but it was evident that i had missed more sessions than everyone eslse in the dojo.however when we went on to weapons we used one that was new to the people of my standard and i was more than able to keep up with those. proving that it is the missed sessions and not my lack of ability that is hindering me.the weapon we trained with was the sho-jo (sp?) it is a stick about the size of a coffee table leg. i found it more difficult than the quarterstaff as the hand movements and placements are more intricate. it was a weapon i quite liked though as it is one that may be of use in real life. the aim is to work with 2 of them in escrima style, can't wait to try that though i know i will struggle with it.as for the weights. i completed a 3/4 session, curtailed by work meetings but i am happy that i still managed to get some in.

                      	 bloody heavy stick
	                       
                          

completed a good session of weight training yesterday. i finished off by go through my taisabachi with and olympic bar as a jo. it was bloody heavy for the movements, made worse by doing it at the end of a session, but felt good in that i can see some sort of benefit coming from it.the olympic bar weighs aroung 15kg so maybe when that becomes easier i will try with weights added. whether this is a good thing to do i don't really know. but surely it must help. i have to use a lot more control, no swinging etc. but waybe when i go back to the oak staff it will be harder to control. i don't bloody know to be honest but i will keep using it in the meantime.on the weapons note, the missus is getting a bit annoyed by the different ones i keep bringing back, worried about the spendings and the clutter. i am developing special martial artist selective hearing for this. i train every day!

i missed 4 sessions due to family and injuries so again i feel like i am back to square 1.i have kept up the weight training and my fitness is improving.last night we did some throwing and dai-jo work. i felt i was advancing quite quickly and was disappointed that the lesson had to end.i really need to get to training even to just watch when injured.it seemed however that i wasn't the only person to miss a few sessions so i didn't feel like i had fallen back too much, but it was still inacceptable. why can't i get my arse into gear more often. i am sure there are people with as many committments as me who manage to train successfuly.it is a bad time of year for people in my profession (we have mad spurts of activity every 3 months or so) so i am making excuses for myself!! - pathetic.as for the others, last night was particularly good because i spent most of the session with the more experienced people and they were more able to pick up on my mistakes and help me with them. it is good to train with those of your ability but great to get help from those above - there are none below!!anyway, i will not be training on sunday as i am off to my home town for the weekend, so i must make sure i don't miss the midweek session. weight training today followed by a gym triathalon tomorow and football tonight - very busy!!btw the picture is not from our club but shows the type of thing we do and the outfits.

already i am disgusted with myself by finding easier things to do than train and study. the weekends for me are an absolute destructive force.after working hard all week, in the gym , in work and in class i wind down too much on the weekend and allow yself to feel guilty for the time missed with the wife and family during the week.saturday was a day spent with them, and a rest day. we went to the local animal sanctuary then into town, we ate badly but that was ok as it was a one off.however come the evenng i succumbed to take aways curry and too much cider!!! destroying a weeks work in one session. i paid no thoughts to my kar all day.sunday i got up, slightly hungover but determined. i managed to go out and play football in the morning, but cried off kar in the evening as i felt leaving my wife with ill children was a bit unfair. she wouldn't have minded me going at all so it was my own laziness that prevented my training and i am very ashamed of myself!! i will try to make up in the gym today for that pathetic show.too often am i easily distracted from what i consider important (not that my family aren't the most important things in my life) i take on too much and leave myself with little spare time.maybe it is time to cull some of my activities.
