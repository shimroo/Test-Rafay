lu, wm survivor ›
“the tremendous outpouring of compassion from all of those around me became the ‘gift’ of cancer which sustained me with much gratitude.”



 
marian, hl survivor ›
“the day i rang the bell after receiving a clean bill of health made me feel like a butterfly that had finally broken out of her cocoon to take flight.”



 
nick, dlbcl survivor ›
“people always want to know, ‘how should i interact with someone i care about who has cancer?’ i think the answer’s easy: give them a future. give them something to look forward to. plan things with them, because we all need a future to survive for.”



 
nina, diffuse large b-cell lymphoma survivor ›
“when i was diagnosed, i made a promise to myself that i wouldn’t let cancer control my happiness – a promise which ended up being one of the best things i could’ve ever done.”
