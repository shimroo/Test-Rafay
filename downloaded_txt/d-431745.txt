a study in genesis chapter 12:1-9







genesis chapter 12


his name had been abram, meaning “exalted father.” later it
would be changed to abraham, meaning “father of a multitude.”



verse 1 – god instructs abram to leave his homeland and go
to a place unnamed. this is the way it is with god. he calls and we go. not to
go when god calls is like a slap in his face. his call to christ is much the
same: god calls, we respond. if we respond obediently, the reward is even
greater than abram’s.



verse 2-3 – god makes a promise to abram. he will bless him.
blessing is a much misused term today. we think of god’s blessings as material.
the more he gives us the more we feel “blessed.”



if you look the word up in a bible dictionary you will see
it defined as “happy.” but the word “happy” did not mean the kind of giddy, or gratified
feelings we get when things are going our way. contextually, in the bible, “happy”
means deeply spiritually satisfied.
the beatitudes can properly be read: deeply
spiritually satisfied are the poor in spirit, etc.



that is why people going through unimaginable trials can
still be blessed. that is why christians in lands where they are persecuted,
tortured and killed can be blessed. that is why people in “under developed”
countries can be blessed. 



god’s blessing to abram is chapter two of the story of god’s
redemptive work with mankind. jesus is descended from abram, as shown in
matthew 1. those who follow him are a direct result and fulfillment of abram’s
blessing.



verses 4-5 – abram did what god told him to do. god has
called us to radically follow christ. we must do so, even when we cannot see
where it will lead. by trusting god in christ, we know that our destination is
eternity with him in heaven.



verses 6-7 – abram’s obedience to god would lead him and
ultimately israel into some difficult earthly times. abram went anyway.



god promised the land to abram. god always keeps his
promise, no matter what world events might or might not take place.



abram built an altar to god. an altar is a place of
sacrifice. it served to remind people of their gratitude to and dependence upon
god.



verses 8-9 – abram “pitched his tent” on a mountain and
built another altar. then he continued on toward the biblical region of judah.



christians have no need for an altar. the sacrifice of
christ at the cross of calvary is all of the sacrifice god needs for the
redemption of mankind. those who follow god to the cross will find eternal
life.

additional thoughts


god promises to show abram a country. abram did not see
the country, but he headed out by faith. we know he went by faith because faith
is the essence of things hoped for; the evidence of things unseen. following
god by faith means doing what he tells you, even when you don’t know where he
is leading.



abram built an altar in shechem. in the old testament, an
altar is a place where something dies as a sacrifice. under the new covenant,
an altar is a place where we die to self. we don’t need it for a sacrifice,
jesus has provided the sacrifice…himself. to follow him, we must die to self.



israel was chosen by god and was expected to be 1) a
witness of god’s ways; 2) a keeper of god’s word (romans 3:2); 3) a channel for
god’s wonder (messiah). god chose israel because he’s the “captain of the
team,” and he gets to choose. he chose them to provide the path to messiah,
jesus. those who bless israel (and her mission) will be blessed. those who
curse israel (and thus reject messiah) will be cursed. and that’s just the way
it is today and always will be.




god says unequivocally that he gave canaan (the west
bank) to the jews. it’s their land, not the palestinian’s land, or your land or
my land. it’s israel’s land, and we would do well to respect that, even if we
don’t like it.

a study in genesis chapter 11








genesis chapter 11



this chapter of the bible is not so much about building a tower or the
capabilities of man. it is about the
corruption of man’s nature.



when adam chose to disobey god in the garden of eden, he immediately
brought upon himself and the entire human race both spiritual and physical death
(genesis 2:17; romans 3:23; 5:12; 6:23).



the resident sin-nature is
passed on down through the blood line of the male to every human throughout
history, except christ jesus who was born of a virgin without the involvement
of a human male.



the sin nature is the center of
man’s rebellion toward god and is variously designated in scripture as “sin” (a
singular noun—rom. 7:13), “flesh” (gal.5:16), and “old man” (eph. 4:22).



whereas the lost person has no resident power to do other than succumb
to his sin nature, the saved person has the ability to choose (or yield to) the
holy spirit within himself to overcome it.

chapter 11:1-4



the bible here utilizes two distinctly different hebrew words to
describe the process of communication of the entire human race at this time in
history. one is dabar, which may mean
“the content of what is being communicated” (the mind-set); and the other is sepheth, which is also translated “lip”
or “language” and refers to the actual linguistic signs, symbols and words
utilized in such communication. so not only did man at this stage of his
development use the same language, but all humans were of one accord in their
intent and purpose upon earth.



in genesis 9:1, god commanded those who were saved from the flood to
disperse and populate the entire earth. in direct opposition to god’s explicit
direction, they chose to stay together in their “comfort zone.”



the tower of babel outlined:



1.  all
nations unite to use technology (bricks) to build a big city.

2.  they
build a tower, ostensibly to reach to the gods.

3.  god
knows that this city will be a nightmare.

4.  in his mercy, god
scatters the people.



the people decided to build a grand tower, which is commonly called the
“tower of babel.” they apparently did this in order to establish their
self-identity, to set themselves apart and to demonstrate their pride in
themselves—to “make a name” for themselves.



the tower of babel was a great
human achievement, a wonder of the world. but it was a monument to the people
themselves rather than to god. we may build monuments to ourselves (expensive
clothes, big house, fancy car, important job) to call attention to our
achievements



genesis 11:5-9

god confused their language in order that they
could no longer understand each other and scattered them over the entire earth. 



the provision of languages (“tongues”) at pentecost (acts 2:5-11) was a
reverse of the confusion of languages at babel.



when god’s word is proclaimed, he promotes union, understanding and
order.



today, mankind is once again attempting to come together as one race (via the
united nations, the european union and other agencies)



16.  what is also significant in
this passage is the shortening of the life span of the human race, a natural result
of the curse placed not only on man but upon the earth, which now exposes man
to environmental effects that prove detrimental to his health. this shortening
of the life span is seen in the following life spans of those mentioned in this
passage.



name life span in years

shem 600

arphaxad 438

salah 433

eber 464

peleg 239

reu 139

serug 230

nahor 148

terah 205



genesis 11:29



the name “abram,” in the hebrew means “exalted father.” when his name
was changed to 

“abraham,” in chapter 17, its meaning is “father of a
multitude.”



questions:  what have you learned about the character of god in these passages?



what have you learned about god’s love for his creation?

what have you learned about his plan for its
redemption?

a study in genesis 8 and 9








fill a large
jar half-way with sand, fine gravel, tiny pebbles and regular sized pebbles.
then fill it full with water. shake it up very well and set it on a counter top
to settle. notice how it settles almost (but not quite) perfectly with heavier pebbles
on the bottom and sand on the top. you can see four distinct layers with some
mixing.



so it is
that geologists have found sea creatures at the top of mountains and layers of
rocks and minerals in canyons and other places where strata is observed. they
have also found skeletons in places no one could imagine they could be. this is
all evidence of a world-wide flood.



chapter 8



verse 1-5 –
the waters of the flood receded, no doubt leaving strata as it did so. 



verses 6-14 –
noah used birds to determine when it was safe to exit the arc. the birds had
found homes, and the earth was dry.



verses 5-19 –
the animals had entered the arc by kind; that is: feline, canine, cloven hooved,
etc. they exited the same way. they repopulated the earth. animals that had not
gotten on the arc perished and no longer roam the earth.

noah and his
family were instructed to exit the arc



verse 20 – the
first thing noah did was to build an altar on which to present the first
recorded sacrifice to god. we no longer have or need altars. altars are a place
of sacrifice for the remission of sin and the sacrifice for our sins has
already been made in the person of jesus christ.



verse 21 –
god recognized noah’s offering of thanksgiving and promised never to “curse the
ground” again. this in spite of the fact that he knew that man’s heart was
sinful from birth. he had another plan to take care of that issue: his only
son, a final sacrifice.



verse 22 - there
is something very expressive in the original hebrew: od col yemey haarets, until all the days of the earth; for god does
not reckon its duration by centuries, and the words themselves afford a strong
presumption that the earth will someday cease to exist.



1 peter
3:21, makes the ark a figure of baptism. some try to make his comments mean
that baptism saves, just like the eight souls were saved by the ark. that would
be a contextually wrong interpretation. we are saved by, and only by, the
remission of sin accomplished by the finished work of christ at the cross of
calvary and his resurrection.



chapter 9



verse 1-10 –
noah is instructed to begin the process of repopulating the earth. he is given
dietary rules to follow and is told that god would hold mankind accountable for
how they treat one another.



verses 11-16
– god establishes an unconditional covenant with noah. no matter what, he will
never again destroy the earth with water. the sign of this covenant was a
rainbow. 



a rainbow is
an extraordinary thing. it is a refraction of the first command of god, “let
there be light.” to see a rainbow, the source of light (the sun) must be behind
you. every color of the spectrum is present in every rainbow. what a beautiful
way to seal this covenant.



do not make
the sophomoric mistake of thinking that because god promised to “remember” his
covenant that he sometimes forgets. god is god. he never forgets. the rainbow
was not for his benefit. it was for ours.




the light of
the world (jesus) is the ultimate fulfillment of god’s promise: a new covenant.

 how christ thought - week 1








session 1 



writing to
the jews about jesus being the fulfillment of all of the prophecies of
scripture (the old testament, for them), 



matthew records the genealogy of
jesus, the circumstances surrounding his birth, his baptism and his temptation
in the desert. then he writes about his message.



in matthew
4:17, jesus begins his preaching ministry by saying, “…repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” without going into a
detailed definition of the kingdom of
heaven, just know that jesus was telling the people that his presence was
the embodiment of that kingdom. 



next, jesus
called twelve men to drop what they were doing, forsake their occupations and
families and to follow him. 



jesus demands no less from us today. if we are to
be his, we must totally “sellout” to him. he is not interested in some
compartmentalized part of your life, he wants it all or nothing.



without
going into detail, matthew states that jesus went to many places, healed many
people and drew very large crowds.



the next thing matthew gives us is an account of jesus longest recorded
sermon. interestingly, it can be read in its entirety in 10 or 15 minutes. in
this sermon you will find great insights into how jesus thought; that is: his
mind set. 



here is a brief outline of what we call the sermon on the mount.

a.              
how we should think (the
beatitudes) – matthew 5:3-12

    1.               
there are ten of them (if
you count verse 12 as one…which it is).

    2.               
they speak of recognizing
one’s spiritual condition.

b.               
who we are

    1.               
salt

    2.               
light

c.               
how jesus fulfilled the
law and prophesy

    1.               
the law is perfect and
those who break it (which includes all of us) are doomed

    2.               
we must be better than
the pharisees and teachers of the law to be saved.

d.              
examples from the law

    1.               
murder

    2.               
adultery

    3.               
divorce

    4.               
oaths

    5.               
revenge

    6.               
loving the unlovable

e.               
having a giving heart

   1.               
humble, even secret
giving

   2.               
seeking no recognition

f.               
prayer

    1.               
not for show or to
impress others

    2.               
the form of prayer

        a)               
worship

        b)               
submission

        c)               
petition   

        d)               
forgiveness

        e)               
deliverance (salvation)

        f)            praise



g.              
fasting

    1.               
not for show or to
impress others

    2.               
humbly

h.              
your relationship to
physical things

    1.               
focus on heaven

    2.               
use them to serve christ

i.                
worry

    1.               
don’t be concerned with
things

    2.               
have faith that god will
provide what you really need

j.                
judging others

    1.               
let god do the judging of
another’s heart

    2.               
understand your own
spiritual needs

k.              
trusting in god’s
provision

    1.               
ask, seek and knock

    2.               
treat others like you
want to be treated

l.               
few will really follow
christ

    1.               
the road with the most
people on it leads to destruction

    2.               
the road to eternal life
is very narrow: it is jesus or nothing

m.              
warning about false
prophets

    1.               
wolves in sheep’s
clothing

    2.               
right doctrine is
extremely important. weed out those who teach untruth

n.              
wisdom

    1.               
build on sand – die 



    2.               
build on the rock who is
christ – live eternally

a study in genesis chapter 5







throughout the old testament god repeatedly gives us proof that jesus is the long awaited messiah. he gave that proof in many ways, but one of the more frequent ways was to reveal the genealogies that wound their ways unbroken right up to the birth of christ.

matthew reviewed the genealogies in his first chapter to help the jews to whom he was writing to understand that jesus is who he said he is. although genealogies might seem too boring to read, a careful study of them is very inspirational. they prove jesus!

in chapter 5 of genesis we have such a genealogy. it shows the bloodline from adam to noah. there are all kinds of characters in the list. their names and their names' meanings are in the picture in the upper left.we know most about enoch and methuselah.

we know enoch because he "...walked with god; then he was no more, because god took him away." (genesis 5:24). methuselah we know as the oldest man recorded in the bible, having lived some 969 years.

the last characters in the list are lamech (not the violent guy of chapter 4), noah and his three sons, shem, ham and japheth.

they set the stage for the most catastrophic event ever to strike earth, and event that would reveal god's character, his grace and his provision...the flood.

saturday lessons

the saturday lessons are bible studies that are useful in a sunday school or bible study class. they often contain questions without answers to stimulate the reader's thoughts about a particular scripture. feel free to use any or all of the saturday lesson.



spiritual truths you need to know

1. the bible is god's revelation of his character, his love forhis creation and his plan for its redemption. it's not about you, it's all about him.2. everything you need to know about god is found in the word of god; nothing you need to know about god is not found in the word of god and anything you think you know about god that's not in the word of god you just made up.3. the father is not the son and he is not the spirit, but he is god.jesus is not the father and he is not the spirit, but he is god.the spirit is not the father and he is not the son, but he is god.4. the concept of the trinity cannot be explained by the mortal minds of man, but it is absolutely biblical.5.  all proper understanding of scripture must begin with the absolute sovereignty of god.6. to properly interpret any scripture, it must be liberally bathed in john 3:16, the pivotal verse of the whole bible. 7. god is omnipotent; omnipresent and omniscient.8. whenever we disagree with some aspect of the character of god (such as his fairness or his justice), it is we who are wrong and must adjust our thinking; for god is always right.9. books are great, but they represent the authors’ opinions and conclusions and must never take the place of scripture as our test.10. how to know christ: admit that you’re a sinner (romans 3:23); believe that jesus is god’s son (romans 10:9); commit to follow christ and make him your lord and master.
