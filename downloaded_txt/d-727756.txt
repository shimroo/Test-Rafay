the miracle continues….





















in may 2021 we launched a finance appeal. we have never been an organisation that is continually asking for money, although from time to time we have made the needs known. many of you have made sacrificial contributions, either as
                      one-off payments or regular donations, and, from the bottom of my heart, we want to thank those of you who’ve done so! below is a short video where roger shares his vision for the future.

a musical to suit everyone and any occasion. what’s especially good about roger jones’ musicals is that you don’t have to be a musical expert to take part! a fantastic way of bringing people together to sing and spread the good news which is at the very heart of every musical.

cmm has been an integral part of my christian  journey and helped me develop a deeper relationship with god. each bible based musical and cmm workshop is portrayed in such a way that it has helped my understanding of scriptures….it has been a privilege to witness how the holy spirit has moved in peoples lives through these musicals and workshops.”
