pac-man-inspired installation at moca busan

march 15th, 2024





for this incredible group show at moca busan in south korea, we had the rare opportunity to curate a selection of our past and recent works in a space entirely designed by us. the layout draws inspiration from a longtime obsession: pac-man! the white raised floor—commonly found in office spaces and data centers—mimics the walls and pathways of the iconic video game maze. works in the show include darko maver (1998), freedom (2010), my generation (2010), emily’s video (2012) and at the center of the maze – where the ghosts spawn in the game – what has been seen (2017). info here, photos here.
