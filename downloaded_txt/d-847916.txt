trampoline flips













welcome to trampoline flips, your one stop shop for how-to's,
 pictures and friendly trampoline related
 discussion. 



what am i doing now?
 i'm learning how to do some of these trampoline flips on the
 ground. 

why?
because being able to do backflips and such is much more impressive when its done on the ground.

how are you doing this?
i've joined the new extreme-sport called "tricking" which is simmilar to skateboarding and other
 extreme-sports in that you don't need a designated place to do it.

what the hell is tricking?
it's a cross between gymnastics and karate, in which you do flips and amazing spin-kicks
 in urban or rural areas (i prefer parks with nice grass and lots of people).

how can you learn to trick?
go to one of the best sites in the world 
 to learn all about tricks.


 if you want to contact me leave a message on the message
 board or instant message me on aim, my screen name is misteroranges and i'm

 to me on aim or post them on the message board. if you want i can make you a 
picture page and link it to the homepage here.
