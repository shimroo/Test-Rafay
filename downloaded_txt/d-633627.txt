research

rmcybernetics is involved in numerous research and development projects covering a range of disciplines. we work as consultants and developers for companies and individuals who are looking to create new technology, products, or to discover new information. when we build prototype devices for you, we can take whatever level of involvement you need. we can fully integrate with you and use our wide ranging knowledge of science and technology to help develop your idea. if you prefer, you can just let us know what you need and leave us to it.


media

our media services include technical consultancy for tv, internet & printed media. from helping to improve the scientific accuracy of science fiction, to providing scientific articles, photographs, high voltage effects, and building props for stage and screen. our consultancy services can add a great level of interest to your documentary project as we can provide technical demonstrations, interviews, and one off science experiments tailored for tv and  media.


cybernetics

cybernetics involves the study and use of information and control systems. cybernetics ties all our work together and allows us to integrate many areas of science and technology into our projects.
