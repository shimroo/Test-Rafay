revised and includes rare unpublished photographs. read about the criminals of the nineteen twenties and thirties, and the heroic lawmen who tracked them down. john dillinger became a "bigger than life" celebrity after his death in july of 1934.  his reputation would triumph and soar upward to become a giant in his trade; fourteen months later his career would skid to a tradic end. dillinger participated in three gangs, escaped from two jails, raided three police departments, escaped several police and fbi traps, and helped mastermind the biggest jailbreak in history from the indiana state penitentiary at michigan city.  it was a time of crime of corruption on both sides of the law. the line between the good guys and the bad guys was narrow if not indistinguishable.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  new!!!!      john dillinger historical crime museum       (june 22, 1903 - july 22, 1934)      note: the john dillinger historical crime museum is a tribute, dedicated to the memory of the late joe pinkston. pinkston was considered a "top notch"  investigator and authority of criminals like john dillinger, as well as a rare memorabilia collector. he devoted his life to the preservation of historical artifacts and the investigation of criminals, interviewing more eye-witnesses and those involved, than any other historian on record. this was a feat that cannot be duplicated, because most of the survivors of the 1930s have since passed on.         http://www.johndillingerhistoricalmuseum.4t.com/index.html

the great depression era, also known as the dark years. what was so great about it? nothing. it was a time of heartache and suffering for the entire nation. these were devastating tough times and nearly impossible to find work during 1933. millions of people were unemployed. if you were a man with a prison record, well you were just out of luck, no one could afford to hire you. the economy was very unstable and there just wasn't any work. criminal's came out of the woodwork during the great depression. the banks who were taking peoples life savings and foreclosing on mortgages were considered the bad guys. people began to admire bank robbers like john dillinger and pretty boy floyd. good honest hard working folks who lost everything developed a whole new outlook on society. many decided it was better to steal than starve.  i've never believed that it is right to judge people, but when it comes to j.edgar hoover and the fbi of the nineteen thirties i feel justified to make an exception. it is a natural fact that j.edgar hoover concealed the truth of the final fate of many criminals's to gain admiration for the bureau. he disguised injustice for absolute power to strengthen the roots of the fbi without question. the fbi kept the facts under lock and key. today as we learn the truth we realize that some outlaws may not have been as bad as the fbi made them out to be. and as the truth comes into focus, we learn about the real j. edgar hoover.
