impact and legacy of xxxii iau general assembly described in nature astronomy
















the iau will change its digital interface in 2025. it is expected to become visible to the public and our members from march 2025.
this is a significant effort driven by a small team, and we appreciate your understanding during the transition.

science is best advanced when there is mutual trust, respect and integrity, and when it is conducted in environments free from harassment. the iau expects all members to uphold the iau code of conduct.
