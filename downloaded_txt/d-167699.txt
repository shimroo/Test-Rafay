why rambouillet sheep?

rambouillet sheep are raised successfully 
			  in a range of climate conditions from the scarce brush area of 
			  texas to the extreme cold winters of wisconsin. breeders are also 
			  realizing the possibilities of raising the rambouillet in diverse 
			  international environments such as mexico, india and canada. the 
			  ability of the rambouillet to produce both meat and wool of high 
			  quality, with little feed and at a wide range of temperatures, are 
			  the key factors to maximizing breeders' profits per acre. in this 
			  era of technology push, the producer must learn to minimize costs 
			  by increasing efficiency. the rambouillet can attain this goal. 
			  for many years, the rambouillet has been known as the profit 
			  "cornerstone" of the u.s. sheep industry.
