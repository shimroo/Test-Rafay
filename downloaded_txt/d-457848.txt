certiscan®: adherence matters












request received
thank you for starting the conversation with imc! we appreciate your interest and one of our team members will reach out to you soon













we help bring new drugs to market faster 



med-ic® is the first smart dose blister ever submitted with an fda priority review resulting in a blockbuster drug approval. 







our mission is to create adherence-focused technologies that enable safer, faster, more efficient, and more innovative clinical research. 



our products automate dose data collection, assist and empower participants, facilitate deeper pk and pd analysis, enhance logistics and the cold chain, and much more. 










 watch video










 contact us











 














what we make 



three technologies.countless research possibilities.​​ 









smart packaging 



 



med-ic® smart blister packages and ecap™ smart bottle caps automatically record every dosing event (and can detect temperature exposures too!) 







adherence platform 



 



certiscan® stores and analyzes smart packaging data, then generates insights and recommendations for all study stakeholders. 







third party integrations 



 



push third party adherence data into certiscan®. pull certiscan® data into your existing systems. or make your mobile apps interoperable with med-ic® and ecap™ using our sdk. 

















what we enable 














 safer research



inappropriate medication use is widespread in clinical research. this can harm individual participant outcomes, jeopardize trial outcomes, and cause hidden errors that are only discovered post market or after publishing (such as a poorly titrated dosage or undiscovered side effect).
our solutions make it easy to detect and treat these harmful issues. many protective features are automatic, such as mobile reminders, misuse alerts, targeted coaching.

detect and treat:

medication non-adherence
medication misuse or abuse
temperature exposure and spoilage
expiry
tampering, fraud, and other lot or batch issues










  faster research



shorter trials that reach their endpoints more quickly can gain weeks or months of additional patent protection. this can amount to substantial additional revenue.
our solutions help studies reach last dose, last participant sooner.


improve timelines by:

automating data collection
replacing diaries and epro with smart packaging
letting certiscan preprocess and analyze data
integrating certiscan with rtsms, edcs, and other platforms
conducting adaptive trials










 more efficient research



clinical trials are becoming increasingly complex and expensive. certain activities in a protocol seem straightforward on paper, but in practice can translate into dozens of hours of site work.
use our solutions to help eliminate needless overhead and streamline processes.


achieve efficiencies and reduce costs by:

automating data collection
basing site inventories on consumption rates
conducting adaptive trials
conducting decentralized trials










 more innovative research



new, technology-first strategies are transforming clinical trials. dcts, participant diversity initiatives, and ai tools are changing from “nice-to-haves” into “must-haves”.
our solutions are modern tools for modern trials that can help researchers and other stakeholders gain and maintain an advantage.


adopt certiscan and smart packaging to:

meet fda trial modernization guidelines
model pk and pd with adherence data
satisfy internal and external innovation requirements
build accurate, objective datasets for use in ai models, participant diversity initiatives, dct tools, and more
publish unique studies that stand out in the literature

testimonials 










“the data we pulled from the trials impacted
several commercial outcomes
as much as they helped us understand our
outcomes and risk factors.
 the evolution of how new technologies are
developed: after we prove they work...we ask is
it negligent not to use them?”



 

donald jones
advisory board, astrazeneca, operating partner, takada digital ventures chief digital officer, scripps research translational, institute













“patients have their own personalized risk
factors and protective factors. we need to individualize these meds to reduce
patient risk. the only way i know how to do this
is with imc technology.”



 

neels groenewald, md
pediatric anesthesiologist, stanford university

















“with [ecap™], you can collect a lot of data passively and really granular data...it consistently
measures data regardless of input from the participant so you’re reducing burden on
them.”



 

mark butler, phd
clinical psychologist, institute of health system science, northwell health













“perhaps the biggest improvement to clinical research processes since barcodes became mandatory for clinical supplies 20 years ago; a truly disruptive solution sure to strengthen results from crucial clinical investigations.”



 

stan kachnowski, phd, mpa, cibe
executive director, health information technology lab (hitlab)
