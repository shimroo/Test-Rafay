testimonials






 wooden axle pegs, screws and ball knobs
you've earned a committed customer -- 2017-06-15  my first order was small yet you treated it as though i was a long time customer!  your website made it easy for me to find what i wanted, your prices are fair, as is shipping and my order arrived quickly.  thank you bear woods!!  you have earned a committed customer.  there are a dearth of businesses who operate as you do.  keep up the great work. -- by tom gardner


 high torque clock movements (up to 5/8" dial face)
happy customer -- 2017-04-28  i am pleased with price and quality. i have purchased a few of these movements and have been satisfied with them.-- karleen stallard


 modified geometry scroll saw blades #2/0r (.0087" x .0236" x 15.4tpi) (pk/12)
great blades! -- 2017-11-09  the pegas blades are so well made i had originally ordered just a few to try them out. after 2 projects i ordered enough so that i could replace all the olson and flying dutchman blades i have... as i wont be using them any longer. thanks! -- marc phillips


wood finial, 15/16" diameter x 2-7/8" (per bag of 25)
could not be more impressed --   12/21/2017  this is the third time i have ordered from bear woods. i live in a very remote community and every time my order has made it in record time. i will continue to get my wood products from them as long as this excellent service that i have become accustomed to continues. thank you so much.-- by howard leaver
