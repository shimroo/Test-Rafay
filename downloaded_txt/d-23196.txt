next generation of leaders












jonathan chen
i think houston christian is quite unique, because even though we are a small school, all the students are given the opportunity to be involved in a huge range of activities. talk to almost any student, and you’ll find out they’re involved in more than one activity.













parker dennis
if someone was transferring like i did, i’d tell them, ‘don’t be scared, don’t let anything hold you back’. i was nervous to make friends, but that wasn’t even the hard part. you are going to feel so welcome when you come!













josh wilmot
hc has given me lifelong memories i’ll hold close to me forever. it equipped me with the knowledge i’ll need for the next chapter of my life.













camille castaneda
i really love houston christian, and i have grown so much here. whether it’s fine arts, sports, chess, there is a club for you and an outlet for you to find your community, your niche of people. if you do both, you can do fine arts in the morning and sports in the afternoon.













payson thomas
houston christian has provided me an opportunity to both grow and exercise my leadership ability. though the rigorous curriculum and extensive extracurricular community, i have been able to develop skills i can use forever.













megan hessel
i got involved with a bunch of sports right away. it really built the foundation of working hard doing school and sports together, and how to manage it. my coaches helped me build my collegiate skill level while still teaching me community and love.













braden biar
i have absolutely loved my four years here at houston christian. i consider this place my second home. this place just feels right. this place has welcomed me. i have experienced so much, and grown so much.













kate welsh
i am grateful for my four years at this school because i now feel ready to enter such a different world than the one i'm in now; i am bold in my faith and continue to look for opportunities where i can benefit the people around me and my community as a whole.













mark henning
i chose houston christian over all the other schools i applied to because of the distinguished scholars program and the leadership programs offered. i was attracted to dsp because it resembled graduate school with research, writing, and presenting.
