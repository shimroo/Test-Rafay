	 frens that i heart
	 
    


yin - she is my weekend or even weekday kaki, she is han's fren, very sincerce, helpful. a down to earth girl with no intention. she will go all the way to help even at 4am. thanks babe, is beyond words that i can describe our frenship. she is a food lover too.. if u wana go mad with food she will be the one with you. once i fall in love with choc a bloc cake and she is the one that within 2 days we spend 70 plus on cake.  jo - the 2nd nonya girl among my frens she is a dear at work, my lunch / dinner kaki. bring sparks to work adding life to every single diffcult task on hand. i am so looking forward to her new life... kw - she is my new unit buddy and she is so so sweet heart and down to earth too... hope that she can stay and assist me in our business unit. fer - this xiaoblur blur is really a typical hainanese, go all out to help and afraid that she will not perform up to your standard. a beau that actually i wanted to place in unilever but i have successful recruit her in. li chong - she is the young me, good in chinese and really is a "got tears got blood", love hatred gal. but she needs to grow and knoe about love. remember li chong kite is not your everything. someone once say that if kite will to fly away she will also fly away with the wind.... cw - another nonya gal that really picky on food and also think that eating is wasting of time. she rather shop and also she is quiet negative at times and love to nag nag but will stop. she will like to tell me hmmm dont tell other people har... that the cute part of her.

standard morning is the meesuah with liver, pork, with essence, with wine. but when it is noon time will be fried rice with soup, i got to eat western food now. i love the cheese serving with potato /bacon. this time round sister is not here at all cos she is busy and also due to the 100 days. not as lost as the first time... having a girl is different. she cried so loudly for milk, :o panic attack. she simply jus canot wait

	 lexuan has arrived
	 
    


water bag burst 1.42am, smsing frens that i am in the tmc. 
contraction starts 8am and it lasted till 1145am.. the nurse keep asking me where is my hubby but i told them that there is no one at home to take care of the kid. i have a 3yo at home. i just send my maid back on a friday  
12 noon i request for c sec. cox bb just couldnt want to engage. the nurse ask me to tell hubby that i need to c sec. 
i went through the worst that i could expect , knife on me - sob sob. i was ask to breathe in and i do not know what is happening later on...
i heard someone call my name but i couldnt wake up.. the funny thing is that i thought is one of my candidate calling my name. 
one whole day i wasnt given any food as they say gone through c sec. we will vomit out whatever we take. 
plain porridge is the first meal. 
the moment i was asked to try getting down the bed i nearly want to cry nurse that assist me to step down from my bed. she help me clean up when the sudden gush of blood flow down my feet. 
i walk like an old woman, i feel like this is worse than contraction.
neighbour bed buddy has a lot of visitors but i have limited but luckily as i am really very tired and i need to lie down.
ultrasound my bb has to go through, i dont know what was that? suddenly i am sad, the pd told me that my bb has i really dont know ....... tbr 4 months
strangely i switch on my phone on the 2nd night at about 4am and i heard gj crying for me. he want me to be with him and sh was there trying to play with him a toy. this is call telepathy?
i was allowed to go home and all was good and i am looking forward to my confinment
