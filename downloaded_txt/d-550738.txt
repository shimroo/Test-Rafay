welcome to the website for:
paul newman!
who am i?
 musician, composer, recording engineer, producer, fitness nut, personal trainer, pole dancer, car enthusiast.
this site will be updated. really it will ðŸ™‚ so check back.
currently i live near charlotte, north carolina being originally from peekskill, new york. having also lived in florida, arizona & california.
music is both my occupation & hobby. i love the creative side of music. composing, playing, engineering, producing and yes listening. all music styles from jazz to rock, classical to country. have toured internationally as well as studio work, yet even playing at home can be exciting. i mainly play bass, guitar, keyboards, banjo, mandolin but have been known to keep a beat on drums as well.
my other passion is classic & antique cars. i have a few that i drive and work on. always something to play with on a decadesâ€™ old car.

for those looking for paramount network systems and wordpress support, i have closed down the business. sorry but i no longer provide support for the plugins and themes i authored.
