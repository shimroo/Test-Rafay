 in our home
        gardens, weeds demand a great portion of our time
        and effort to cultivate a beautiful garden.  in
        the economy of agriculture, controlling weeds is a
        serious, mission-critical, operation.  for agriculture 
        applications, please see the white 
        paper on the weed twister and other alternatives to precise hand weeding 
        in agricultural applications. 
          
 we are surrounded by weeds.  ever since humans
        began planting and cultivating plants, weeds have been a
        problem.  a weed is any plant in the wrong
        place.  weeds take valuable space, water,
        sunlight and nutrients that may otherwise be accessible
        to important crops.  this degrades the quality of
        agricultural products, increases costs, and may result in
        poor nutrition for the intended consumer.  
 consequently, many agricultural solutions include
        efficient, but potentially toxic chemicals.  here
        you may discover that some of the weeds you find in your
        garden may be harmful to the environment or noxious to your
        regional ecology.  
 although some invasive weeds compromise the
        biodiversity of our regional ecosystems, we also have to
        recognize that agriculture often destroys the native
        flora, as well.  can humans have their cake and eat
        it, too?
 by learning more about our  
        natural environment, we can better protect the
        world our children will inherit.  will they inherit
        a world of beautiful flowers and bountiful farms, or will
        we leave them with a "world of weeds?"  will
        the chemicals we use in our own gardens pollute the water
        tables we all share?  how can we protect our
        small
        animals from herbicides?
browse through the gardening
        books section to window shop or purchase
        reference books on gardening, weeds, landscaping and
        related topics.  ergonica has selected special
        titles in association with amazon.com that we believe
        will appeal to our world of weeds visitors.
 the  weeder features page provides a 
        consumer guide and information as well as a weeder
        features chart to help you classify numerous
        non-toxic  weed removal
        tools  on the web market today.  
 this information will help you make the right choices
        in your online shopping for gardening tools and
        especially weed removal tools and products.
  but to some home gardeners, a weed is a
        potential benefit to your garden, as described in
        the   "weeds
        and words" article.  a beautiful fragrance
        to one person, is a cause of hay fever to
        another.  
 take a deep breath, open your eyes, clear your
        senses, and join us for a walk in the natural world of
        weeds.  pour yourself a cup of tea, and visit for a
        while.  if weeds have survived the disfavor of
        humans for millions of years, perhaps we may learn
        something from them?  if this is not a good
        time for you, bookmark this site and come back when it's
        more convenient for your visit.
  according to the bureau of land management,
        some plants are potentially  noxious to the
        environment and should never be transported to other
        areas.  the president of the united states
        has issued an executive order about invasive
        species.  
it's fascinating to see all the tools
        and strategies people have created over the years to
        control weeds, remove weeds, poison weeds, burn weeds,
        and so on.  here you will find perhaps the largest
        selection of mechanical weed removing hand tools
        described on the web.  
 ergonica has also invented a new tool called the weed twister that
        does an excellent job of pulling out individual weeds in
        tight spaces.  whether you're killing weeds or
        "grooming misplaced plants," the tool you
        select could help you get the job done more successfully
        and efficiently.  as suggested in groom your garden,
        your attitude and philosophy could make the difference
        between an arduous task or an artful experience.
 join us for an educational tour of the world of
        weeds by exploring the links and information on this
        site.  these include   scientific studies
        of where weeds come from, agricultural and horticultural
        methods to control weeds, weeding
        tips and sites that list and   categorize plants
 and weeds of all types.  also presented are
        beautiful   gardens
        and arboretums, gardening and nature   support groups, and
        sources where you can  
        purchase tools to control weeds, including this
        site.

				12 - step herbicide detoxification program 







unlike many other weed pullers and 
poppers that require pushing a lever with your foot, for example, the ergonica 
weed twister can be used to remove weeds by their roots (as deep as 12 inches or 
more) located a considerable 
distance from your path.  great for pulling weeds 
under brush or close to thorny cactus plants and brambles, as well as poison ivy 
and other toxic plants, in addition to lawn weeds underfoot like dandelions.  no foot levers or hinged tines that 
often break loose with repeated use!  use the drill-ready turbotorx models 
to efficiently attack patches of unwanted bermuda grass, crabgrass and other 
grassy weeds or vines with prostrate stems.
