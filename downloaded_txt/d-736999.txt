                                    this small book (just 88 pages) will
                                    challenge the reader to consider a
                                    new vision of the bible. via
                                        christus (the way of the christ)
                                    presents full-color art
                                    reproductions which include
                                    twenty-four paintings that are based
                                    on stories from the new testament of
                                    the christian bible together with
                                    twelve additional verses rendered in
                                    calligraphy. the twenty-four
                                    paintings, which are the main theme
                                    of the book, were inspired by key
                                    events in the life and teaching of
                                    christ, the work of the apostles,
                                    and the prophesies within the book
                                    of revelation. these paintings are
                                    not your typical bible illustrations
                                    but, in actuality, mystic visions of
                                    new testament teachings for today's
                                    questioning minds. this artwork
                                    should inspire a new understanding
                                    of the truth embodied in the christ
                                    consciousness -- god is within every
                                    one of us and we are all one!

                                          impromptu by the artist

                                          the artwork, together with the
                                          poem, portrays the
                                          timelessness (acknowledging
                                          ties to antiquity) that
                                          permeates much of the dream
                                          imagery. the pictures portray
                                          the fragmented quality of
                                          dreams -- the difficulty
                                          remembering dreams in their
                                          entirety and how easily they
                                          slip from our memory.

                                          weathered, and torn. the art
                                          reminds us that dreams are
