bad president abuses canada





 i’ve been fond of canada since forever. i’ve been there six times- twice to quebec, twice to toronto, twice to vancouver.most americans don’t follow the news in canada, but i do. i look at the headlines at both the montreal gazette, and the toronto global mail every day, via apple news+.president trump has been a wild lunatic on a number of international matters since he was sworn in this year, but let’s focus on canada here.trump has claimed that canada has not properly secured its border with the us, allowing ( non canadian ) illegals to sneak in to the us. he has also claimed that canada is allowing fentanyl to be produced in canada, and smuggled into the us over the northern border.both issues are fair to raise but trump grossly exaggerates the extent of the problem as respects canada. trump was about to impose a 25% tariff on most canadian goods coming into the us, because canada  was supposedly doing nothing to stop the drugs and the illegals- but then, at the last minute he paused tariff implementation, because pm  trudeau agreed to devote more security at their side of the border. what trump did not tell us that trudeau had -already- reached the same deal with president biden in december 2024.  the screaming and roaring on the us side was about nothing. canada has been a good neighbor and ally of the us for as long as our two nations have been around. trump has seriously harmed that relationship. not only by his inept  “ negotiating “, but by his disrespectful comments about the canadian nation, his comments about making canada the 51st state, all the asinine comments that no real president would ever make.it has long been the tradition that the anthems of both the usa and canada are played before nhl hockey games involving teams from the two countries. recently, we have seen canadian fans boo the us anthem, and in return we have seen us fans in some cities booing the canadian anthem.i expect the trade  and security issues between the nations to be resolved shortly. but damage has been done.  americans will forget this affair shortly, canadians won’t.je me souviens.

atw  roll call! 





 a tangled web was an interesting place. i believe that it lasted for most of two decades.it was the site of much verbal fisticuffs, also the place where some good conversation was had.atw went away, and i was sad when it did. i would  like to invite all participants of the old atw to add a comment here. just a few words to say how you are getting along these days, more if you wish.i hesitate to invite anybody by name, because i will forget people, but here goes – this invite applies to david vance, troll, mahons, patty, daphne, frank, noel, petr, peter, andrew, charles in texas. colm, alison, aileen,  allan from aberdeen, the  guy from rural canada, whose name i forgot. also, if it is possible, i would like to hear what’s going on with chris gaskin, who used to run a couple of websites of his own, and to the folks from united, ireland, irish eagle, and another irish website called el blogador. i don’t have contact information of a number of these people, if anyone could reach out to the long lost, i would appreciate that.

did trump push a bad deal for israel?





 as i have mentioned on the former site, i listen to the english stream from  israel news talk radio every week.it is a private opinion station, tilting right.there is a lot of angry comment on this station at this moment about the truce agreement between hamas and israel. i think that more than a few israeli share this unhappiness.while everyone is happy to see the israeli hostages released, there is great anger that  a much larger number of hamas terrorists  will be released. in an earlier agreement with hamas,  sinwar was released by the israelis. it is likely that this agreement will see the release of other is just as bad as sinwar.both biden and donald trump are taking credit for making this deal happen. both of them are believed to have put pressure on bibi to make it happen. .the  israeli right tends to support  donald trump, but maybe not so much anymore. some might not like bibi so much go forward, either.

patty is ok!





 the other day, patrick asked for patty’s  information. he and david were worried about her, as she lived in the los angeles area. we all were frequent contributors to the atw website. i am happy to report that she is fine, as she moved to florida a few years ago.below, you will see a photo of her former house in pacific palisades, burning to the ground. . please share.also below, please see a note from patty. i will continue to correspond to the old gang, and perhaps bring the group together now and then…hi phantom: so nice to hear from you. thank-you for checking in. my husband and i moved out of the palisades a little over 3 years ago. we sold the house we built; our timing was just plain lucky. we moved to jupiter, florida and we are extremely happy here.we lived in pacific palisades most of our lives, and it was a charming, beautiful spot to live. we left some family, many friends and many memories...so it is beyond words to watch the town burn down.  traumatic really.  no water.  no fire trucks. speechless.  i just cannot express the magnitude of what happened. thanks to the incompetence and stupidity of those in charge, a bad situation became catastrophic. and, it is not over. someone sent me a photo of our old house burning and also a photo of one of the neighborhoods (the alphabet streets).  i'll attach with this letter.the silver lining of this horror is that i have heard from so many people. most that live there  are seriously traumatized.  before i sign off, though, let me ask: how are you?  are you still in nyc?  and do you still write anywhere. i hope you are well and enjoying a brew occasionally with a great group of people for comraderie.  i always thought of atw as a very rowdy bar, like cheers.  patty

congestion pricing in nyc- a good idea?





 as of this past midnight, congestion pricing is in effect in the southern part of manhattan, below 60th st. during peak hours, the additional toll for most drivers of private passenger cars will be nine dollars.the stated goals of this program are to reduce congestion in the central business district, and to use the toll  monies to fund needed mass transit infrastructure work. if these two things happen – that congestion is reduced, and that all the money is efficiently, used for transit infrastructure, then i’m for it.you would never know that anyone is in favor of it if you listen to the new york post and wabc am talk radio. they’ve criticized congestion pricing endlessly.i think that any normal person who works normal hours and who drives into manhattan every day is probably a complete fool. i’ve driven into manhattan during peak hours a few times, it is no fun at all.but for some – medical workers, and first responders who work unpredictable hours, or those blue collar workers who live in places like northeast pennsylvania that don’t have good transit options, the additional $45 a week toll will bite hard. i think that similar congestion pricing plans have worked fairly well in places like london, and in the well run city of singapore. let’s see this scheme in new york really does what it’s supposed to do.

jimmy carter rip 





 it has often been said that jimmy carter was “the worst president in american history”. but many things that are often said are not true, and this is one of them. in my opinion, jimmy carter was a very good foreign policy president. he officially normalized relations with china. he brokered the israel/egypt peace  treaty, a  deal that has stood the test of time. and he pushed through the panama canal treaty, which in my opinion was a deal that was good for the us, and good for our relations with latin america. things in that part of the world could’ve gotten very bad if the us had insisted on holding onto the canal.carter had the bad fortune of being president when the iranian revolution, and the hostage taking of us embassy personnel took place. and he took office not long after the vietnam war came to an end for  the usa, but not for the unfortunate populations of vietnam and cambodia.unlike many presidents and former presidents, i didn’t see jimmy carter trying to cash in on his time in  office. he did many weerth file things after leaving the oval office. we saw  him organizing and getting his hands, dirty and building houses for low income people in various places all over the us with habitat for humanity. when there was a major hurricane in florida, the roof blew off many buildings, but not from the habitat for humanity houses built there by carter’s organization. the habitat for humanity houses were built properly, with the right amount of nails.

syria falls, bad news for iran and russia





 the most important story in the world today is the fall of the assad regime in syria. you’d never know it by watching sunday morning us tv news shows, where 99% of the reporting is on trump, this and trump that, along  with an update on the hunt for the guy who murdered the insurance executive.the bibi government in israel seems to be pretty happy with the  fall of assad. i’m not sure that i would celebrate anytime soon. the largest part of the rebel force, hts ( formally known as the al nusra front )  was once a part of al-qaeda. that is a pretty bad history.the big losers this weekend are russia and iran, both of whom supported the assad government.russia has a  navy  base in tartus, syria, which they should lose now. if they do lose that base, they won’t have any naval facilities in the mediterranean. and the russian ships now in the med will not be allowed to go into the black sea,  as turkey  will not permit them to transit the bosphorous. those ships will be without a port, unless they travel all the way up to saint petersburg. iran has projected power in the past years by supporting hamas, hezbollah, and assad. now, israel has broken the back of hamas and hezbollah, and  assad is bye bye.iranian and russian power looks to be much weaker in the region that it was even six months  ago. that is probably good news, but let’s see what syria looks like a couple of months from now
