i wish i knew who this lady is, or what the words are. i used to know some arabic, but this is difficult for me to interpret. [link]update: her name is amal maher, and she was born in 1985. evidently she is a pretty big deal currently in egyptian music.labels: memory, middle east, music, pretty girls, youtube

	 sharing the secret sharer
	 
    


apparently somebody decided to narrate conrad's novella on youtube, in a william shatnery sort of way. you can read along while listening, if you've got an hour and 42 minutes. but don't do it at work! they'll catch you, and punish you, by making you read it out of a book. to your co-workers. whether they want to hear it or not. while they're doing your work. conrad comes to your cubicle? not good. i would say doubleplusungood, but conrad's ghost would start moaning, and we don't want that.brings new meaning to "i'll wait for the video." watch it, listen to it, or read it? why choose?(incidentally, i found this at yt while trying to find a snippet of a famous scene in chinatown, the one where huston talks to nicholson about wanting to buy the future. i fail to see how this is connected, but what do i know.) but to follow this theme, i might as well share this on dead horse....labels: literature, youtube
