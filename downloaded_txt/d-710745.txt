life in the beaver island archipelago










about the new beaver island book





 
 
 with 208 large pages of lush full-color   photos and interesting facts, the hardcover beaver island book life in the beaver island archipelago has appeal for everyone who loves the   island. its mix of hundreds of photographs of island scenes and stories   combining amusing anecdotes with historic facts makes it something to   turn to, time and again. blending the first decade of the 21st century   into a single year, it depicts the shifting seasons, the shifting shades   the forests, the arrival of soft, blanketing snow and the freezing over   of the lakes, and the blooming of a progression of flowers. it builds   toward the burst of summer activity, the arrival of pleasure craft,   private planes, and, most of all, people — what for beaver island   constitutes the cycle of life. 

              pick up your copy from the   beaver island community center, the beaver island historical society,   mcdonough's market, livingstone studio, island energies, shipwreck   shirts, or the toy museum. when you cannot be here in body, at least you can be in spirit!

the beaver island music festival
a great setting in the woods off the west side road. neat bands.  radiating rhythms. what more could you want? on thursday night some impromptu  sets and joddy's slide guitar warmed things up between scheduled bands as some of the bands and many attendees to the music fest  were delayed when a small pleasure boat collided with the emerald isle in the channel off round lake in charlevoix. the coast guard had to perform an investigation,  but a few hours late the boat finally made her way to beaver, undamaged. and  the night was just getting started.
