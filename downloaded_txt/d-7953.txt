on  truth & realitythe wave structure of matter (wsm) in space
the dynamic unity of reality
and those whose hearts are fixed on reality itself deserve the title of philosophers.
      (plato, republic, 380bc)
denying realism amounts to megalomania
      (the most widespread occupational disease of the professional philosopher).
      (karl popper, 1975)
the resistance to new ideas increases by the square of their importance.
      (russell's law)
the object of the superior man is truth. (confucius)
hi and welcome everyone (june, 2024)
 this website is about truth and reality - about how you and everything 
      around you exist in space. we have an extensive collection of pages on many 
      of the greatest minds from history, with thousands of brilliant quotes that 
      are both inspiring and profoundly important. more than this though, we provide 
      a simple solution to many of the problems of knowledge that have caused 
      humanity so much conflict and confusion.
      and yes, we do realise that people are skeptical of websites on truth and 
      reality. but the solution is obvious 
      once known - it just takes our minds a while to adjust to new ways of 
      thinking.
i have just finished writing up a summary of the wave structure of matter (wsm), it provides a very simple obvious description of physical reality, based upon one substance, space, existing as a wave medium, and one law, bigger waves travel faster.
    here is the essay, it is about 8 pages long, explains most of the problems of physics. i believe the remarkable simplicity and unity of this knowledge will make its truth obvious.

this home page is divided into three parts;
1. summary: on truth and reality - the wave structure 
      of matter
2. latest work (most important pages)
3. four main functions of this website


1. summary: truth & reality: wave structure of matter
reality 
      cannot be found except in one single source, because of the interconnection 
      of all things with one another. ... i maintain also that substances, whether 
      material or immaterial, cannot be conceived in their bare essence without 
      any activity, activity being of the essence of substance 
      in general. (gottfried leibniz, 1670)
 
      (bradley, 1846-1924) we may agree, perhaps, to understand 
      by metaphysics an attempt to know reality as against mere appearance, or 
      the study of first principles or ultimate truths, or again the effort to 
      comprehend the universe, not simply piecemeal or by fragments, but somehow 
      as a whole.
 
the error - the motion of discrete particles in space and time
for the past 350 years (since newton) 
      we have tried to describe an interconnected 
      reality (which has been known for thousands of years) with many discrete 
      and separate 'particles'. thus you have to add forces or fields to the particles 
      to connect them together in space and time. this is merely a mathematical 
      solution and it does not explain how discrete matter particles create 
      continuous fields that act on other particles in the space around them. 
      further, both quantum 
      physics (particle-wave duality, non-locality, uncertainty) and einstein's 
      general relativity (matter-energy curves space-time) contradict the 
      concept of discrete and separate 'particles'.
the solution - the wave motion of space causes matter and time
we simply needed to describe reality from the 
      most simple foundation of the one thing, space, that all matter exists in 
      (look around you now and think about this - we all experience existing in 
      space).
      this leads to only one solution, a wave structure of matter in space from 
      which we then deduce the fundamentals of physics, 
      philosophy and 
      metaphysics 
      to show that it is correct (and scientific / testable, not just our opinion).
fig. 1: there is no particle-wave duality of matter, just a spherical standing wave structure of matter where the wave center creates the 'particle' effect, and the spherical in and out waves provide continual two way communication with all other matter in the universe.we only see the high wave amplitude wave-center and have been deluded into thinking matter was made of tiny little 'particles'. a very naive conception in hindsight - and quantum physics was telling us all along that waves were central to light and matter interactions!
 
deducing reality - uniting metaphysics with science
there are just two steps to deducing the truth about your existence in 
      the universe.
      and i emphasize that none of this is my opinion - everyone will come to 
      the same conclusions since it is deduced.
1. deduce that space is one active substance: unite science & metaphysics: 
      most simple science theory of reality
 science requires physical reality to be logical, sensible and simple (occamâs 
      razor). metaphysics requires the existence of one active substance to explain 
      the causal connection between the many things we experience, as leibniz 
      simply states; 
âreality cannot be found except in one single source, because 
      of the interconnection of all things with one another. ... i maintain also 
      that substances cannot be conceived in their bare essence without any activity, 
      activity being of the essence of substance in general. (gottfried leibniz, 
      1670)
this dynamic unity of reality from one active substance, required to explain 
      how reality is connected together and changing (causal connection) is well 
      known throughout history, the ancient greeks (and indians, chinese, many 
      others ...) realised this 2,500 years ago, as aristotle in his famous metaphysical 
      treatise writes; 
"the first philosophy (metaphysics) is universal and 
      is exclusively concerned with primary substance. ... and here we will have 
      the science to study that which is just as that which is, both in its essence 
      and in the properties which, just as a thing that is, it has. ... the entire 
      preoccupation of the physicist is with things that contain within themselves 
      a principle of movement and rest. and to seek for this is to seek for the 
      second kind of principle, that from which comes the beginning of the change." 
      (aristotle, metaphysics, 340bc)
given we all experience many minds and many material things, but always 
      in one common space, and since we must describe physical reality in terms 
      of only one substance, we must conclude this one substance is space. (if 
      you try using many things, like matter or minds, you have to add a second 
      thing to connect these many things together and this contradicts our rules 
      of science and metaphysics.)
 so now we are considering the properties of this space to explain activity 
      / motion.
      look around you in space and notice that light comes in to you from all 
      directions. this light has well known discrete âparticleâ and continuous 
      wave properties (the famous particle-wave duality of both light and matter). 
      however, we cannot add discrete and separate particles to space (a second 
      substance is not allowed) but we can have space vibrating (a property of 
      space as a wave medium). thus we come to the necessary conclusion that this 
      one substance must be space, and this space must have waves flowing through 
      it in all directions (since we can see things in all directions).
      thus we have our one active substance - vibrating space (the wave motion 
      of space) and this is the cause of change / time. (interestingly, aristotle 
      also realised this connection between time, matter and motion - the common 
      mistake was to consider the motion of matter in space and time - rather 
      than the wave motion of space that causes matter and time.)
finally, we must consider what kind of waves can flow in all directions 
      through three dimensional space. we find the most simple solution is two 
      dimensional plane waves moving in the third dimension. 

      so let us now simply state our conclusion - our truth statement for what 
      exists.
one active substance (three dimensional space) exists and has 
      plane waves flowing through it in all directions.
this is the most simple way to describe physical reality that is in harmony 
      with science and metaphysics - and it is a valid scientific model that can 
      be mathematically treated to make testable predictions.
      fortunately for us, a brilliant philosopher, metaphysicist and mathematician, 
      sir william rowan hamilton (1843) invented quaternions, a three dimensional 
      algebra that does exactly this - they represent the motion of real things 
      in real three dimensional space. hamilton believed this mathematics was 
      special and would be important to physics (he carved it on a stone bridge, 
      as he was walking when he thought of it and did not want to forget!).
      and it turns out he was correct about its importance - in fact he was 60 
      years ahead of einstein in connecting three dimensional space (x,y,z) with 
      time (t) into a four dimensional space-time continuum in one quaternion 
      equation q = t + ix + jy + kz where the i, j, and k terms are imaginary 
      numbers such that i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = 
      -1
"time is said to have only one dimension, and space 
      to have three dimensions. ... the mathematical quaternion partakes of both 
      these elements; in technical language it may be said to be 'time plus space', 
      or 'space plus time': and in this sense it has, or at least involves a reference 
      to, four dimensions. and how the one of time, of space the three, might 
      in the chain of symbols girdled be." (w r hamilton)
 it is beautifully elegant mathematics that perhaps scares off many people 
      because of its use of imaginary numbers i, j, k. but these just represent 
      90 degree rotations. thus i2 = -1 really means a 180 degree rotation 
      which reverses an object's direction, hence the negative sign.
      so whenever you see ix, jy and kz you are considering vectors on orthogonal 
      planes (90 degrees, perpendicular, at right angles) to the x, y and z axis. 
      this then gives us the four dimensional mathematical structure to represent 
      plane waves flowing through 3d space.
 so now we are in a position to test this wave theory of reality to see 
      if it correctly deduces the properties of matter that we observe in the 
      space around us. 
2. deduce the spherical standing waves formed from plane waves in three 
      dimensional space
 and now for the very cool clever bit - it is these waves that create both 
      matter 'particles' and fields! i.e. when you do the mathematics (complex 
      quaternion wave functions) you discover that space actually vibrates in 
      two completely different ways depending upon the phase of the intersecting 
      plane waves - and these two modes of vibration exactly deduce both the quantum 
      field (backgound space) and matter 'particles'.
 background space field vibrations - space vibrates in a fixed (but very 
      complex) vector / transverse wave pattern in all directions.
particle vibrations (electrons & positrons) - space vibrates spherically 
      around a central point - a scalar longitudinal spherical standing wave.
 of profound importance though is the fact that there are exactly four 
      unique phase arrangements of the plane waves such that all the vector / 
      transverse wave components cancel one another and you are left with this 
      scalar / longitudinal spherical standing wave (space vibrates radially in 
      and out around a central point).
      two of these phase arrangements create the two spin states of electrons, 
      and two phase arrangements create the two spin states of the opposite phase 
      standing waves, positrons (anti-matter).
      this keeps the phase of electrons and positrons locked to the phase of background 
      space (which is the same everywhere) thus explaining how these wave-center 
      'particles' are locked in their respective phase relations with one another 
      across the universe (what i was seeking).
how amazing - we never needed to add newton's 'god particles' to space, 
      these appear naturally as the wave centers of spherical standing waves which 
      naturally form from these plane waves. the wave diagrams are very useful 
      aids for understanding this.) 
 

this simple diagram represents intersecting plane waves. when 
      you combine the top eight diagrams you get the image below. you 
      can clearly see the spherical effects starting to form (circles in 2d, you must imagine it in 3d) - and importantly 
      you also see opposite phases (positrons and electrons) being formed. we 
      have a page of wave 
      diagrams that will help you visualize the spherical standing wave structure 
      of matter (wsm) in space.


 very importantly, the wave solutions are in pairs. this means that whenever 
      the phase arrangements of intersecting plane waves produce an electron, 
      they will also necessarily produce the opposite phase positron next to it. this explains matter-antimatter 
      pair production which is occurring everywhere in space all the time  - because 
      space vibrates in two distinct patterns (particles and fields) which it 
      is constantly switching between. (known as virtual particles by modern physics, since their particle conception of matter cannot explain them.)
      however if you want to see and use these 'particles' then you need to add 
      energy to them to separate them (before they annihilate / switch back to 
      the quantum field vibratory pattern). this explains why a strong electric 
      field in 'empty space' creates a stream of positrons and electrons. (i actually 
      deduced this then checked - it is true.) this also means physics 
      understanding of the energy of matter and space is incomplete / wrong, it 
      is missing this underlying wave energy of space that creates both matter 
      'particles' and their 'fields'. thus modern physics thinks that particle 
      / anti-particle pair production contradicts conservation of energy laws 
      (since matter and anti matter both have positive energy) so they cheat and 
      use the uncertainty principle to avoid this (search pair production in wikipedia). 
      the solution, the pair production is just the plane waves changing their 
      phase arrangements such that space changes from a field vibration pattern 
      to two particle vibration patterns (spherical standing waves). both wave 
      patterns have the same energy - it is just distributed in different directions 
      / wave patterns.
the very famous dirac equation of matter and fields (the universe) is 
      explained!
from the above plane wave formalism in 3d space the quaternion wave equation 
      you get is a general form of the dirac equation - and this is really the 
      equation of the universe as it connects the 'field' to the 'particle' - 
      all from intersecting plane waves in space.
      dirac found the solution mathematically by factorizing the energy equation 
      of matter (klein gordon equation) into its component parts, whereas we have 
      deduced it from first principles of plane waves in space.
interestingly, it is well known that the dirac equation represents multiple 
      plane wave solutions, but physicists, blinded by their particle conceptions, 
      and then later by born's probability wave interpretation, never imagined 
      real plane waves in space as a solution. this is a classic example of existing 
      beliefs blinding us to novel truths - or put another way, we are biologically 
      programmed to be culturally programmed! (this is also why planck observed 
      that new ideas only arise in physics when those with the old ideas die!)
 despite the errors one must also marvel at how much mathematical analysis 
      was done on the tiny details of matter without ever understanding it. but 
      now any sensible logical person can simply understand and visualize physical 
      reality - and most importantly, you can deduce all the central equations 
      of modern physics (einstein's relativity and quantum physics) using three 
      dimensional quaternion wave equations. this has already been done - i have 
      just provided the physical meaning of the equations which no one else seems 
      to have yet realised.
"if quaternions are used consistently in theoretical 
      physics, we get a complete description of the physical world, with relativistic 
      and quantum effects easily taken into account. thus hamiltonâs idea, which 
      motivated more then half of his professional life, that quaternions are 
      a fundamental building block of the physical universe, appears to be essentially 
      correct in the light of contemporary knowledge." 
      (andre gsponer and jean-pierre hurn, https://arxiv.org/ps_cache/math-ph/pdf/0201/0201058v5.pdf)
basically stated, once you have the correct three dimensional mathematical 
      structure for describing real plane waves in real three dimensional space, 
      you find that you can deduce all the main equations of modern physics. i.e. 
      we now have a complete metaphysical / scientific theory that deduces all 
      of quantum physics and einstein's relativity with the complete mathematics 
      already done.
      i have just provided the final piece of the puzzle, the connection of quaternion 
      maths to real complex plane waves in three dimensional space that form real 
      scalar spherical standing waves and their wave-center 'particles'.
atomism & postmodern relativism vs metaphysical substance, causal 
      connection, absolute truth and realism
 i am well aware of postmodernism and its dangerously destructive conclusion 
      (to reason, science and society) that we are trapped in the mind and can 
      never know the thing in itself (see kant), thus metaphysics is meaningless, 
      all knowledge is uncertain, merely cultural human constructs, logical positivist 
      tools for thinking.
however, once you understand, and most importantly, correct the errors 
      that were made that led to postmodernism (e.g. removing discrete âparticlesâ 
      and understanding causal connection from one active substance) you find 
      that we can imagine physical reality perfectly well - one substance space 
      vibrates in a variety of wave patterns that we observe as matter. (and if 
      this seems strange to you, well that is our natural response to seeing familiar 
      things with new knowledge, in time it does open a beautiful vista on the 
      majestic harmony of our universe.)
most significantly, metaphysics, this awareness of the dynamic unity of 
      reality, was central to the emergence of reason and philosophy, the arts 
      and sciences, thus it is correct and long overdue to re-unite this with 
      science.
      and here we see the cause of all the confusion - newton's mechanics had 
      a metaphysics of space and time to which he must add discrete 'particles' 
      with mass and 'magical' forces to connect them (action-at-a-distance). this 
      was always just a mathematical solution which never explained how matter 
      was connected across the universe. by describing reality most simply, in 
      terms of waves is space, we now understand how 'particles' can appear in 
      this space as discrete things, yet in reality are connected across the universe 
      by their in and out waves (plane waves).
is this a complete theory of everything (toe)? what is the nature of god?
no. i do not believe that is possible. this is a description of physical 
      reality, i.e. wave energy interactions in space, how this explains matter. 
      but science says nothing about how our minds can convert sense data based 
      on wave patterns into feelings of love and hate, good and bad, pleasure 
      and pain, tastes and colors, all the higher sensual, emotional and moral 
      representations of our minds. we know these things exist because we all 
      personally experience them. to me this is the religious spiritual side of 
      human existence, where god is the total properties of space (god is not 
      separate from the world, god and nature are one - thus we have moved from 
      newton and god's particles to god's space or godspace).
albert einstein expresses this enlightened view of god well, he writes;
'i believe in spinoza's god who reveals himself in the orderly 
      harmony of what exists, not in a god who concerns himself with the fates 
      and actions of human beings.'
we find this connected harmony of a dynamic unity of reality (god, brahman, 
      tao, spirit, energy, light, vibration) is central to all major world religions, 
      thus their common, and very important moral foundation of 'do unto others 
      as to thyself'. this is true - the other is part of the self! to me this 
      is all we need to know to live kindly with one another, with all life on 
      earth.
please help humanity by sharing this knowledge.
from this most simple foundation of plane waves in space naturally creating 
      two different modes of vibration - spherical particle vibrations and complex 
      field vibrations - we can now deduce all of modern physics.
however, the complexity that evolves from this simple dynamic wave system 
      is extraordinary, as is required to explain how such amazing life can exist 
      in the universe. most importantly, we can see why evolution (change) and 
      ecology (interconnection) are true as they are properties of physical reality. 
      over billions of years this evolution and ecology of matter waves in the 
      universe has evolved levels of complexity far beyond the comprehension of 
      our feeble minds.
      for some perspective - there are a trillion trillion wave-center 'particles' 
      in a pin head, all vibrating 10^20 times per second with 10^80 other wave-center 
      'particles' in the universe - mind boggling!
the problem for humanity is that our human civilization is also a very 
      complexly evolved wave structure of the universe that is beyond our comprehension, 
      and now clearly in great trouble due to human overpopulation and the resultant 
      destruction of nature, climate change and the pollution of air, land and 
      water.
      basically, our current global system functions in a very destructive dysfunctional 
      manner simply because it is founded on past myths and customs, these are 
      not true thus they cause us harm. and there is only once solution - to understand 
      the truth about our existence in the universe so that we can think and act 
      wisely. and one central wisdom - life on earth is far too complex to be 
      regulated or recklessly exploited (gmo), it must be allowed to function 
      naturally or it will collapse, wiping out much of our civilization and causing 
      the deaths of billions (our children). 
given the censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals (founded 
      on the standard model / particle physics) the internet is clearly the best 
      way to get new knowledge visible to the world. a world now in great need 
      of wisdom from truth and reality.
  
the importance of truth and reality as the source of wisdom
this knowledge of the wave structure of matter in space 
      provides us with a 'source code' from which we can deduce the truth as a 
      foundation for acting wisely.
      clearly humanity now faces many problems caused by myths and customs that 
      result in endless conflict and harm. thus knowing the truth about physical 
      reality is critically important for our future survival on our fragile and 
      beautiful little planet.
basically i hope to make it obvious to people that are either sensible 
      and logical, or enlightened 
      spiritual / religious that we have worked out physical reality (matter-energy 
      interactions in space). to show you that we 
      can perfectly imagine matter interactions in space - they are just wave 
      interactions.
      then you will understand that this whole postmodern 
      uncertainty and skepticism 
      arose from trying to describe an interconnected reality (where matter is 
      a large structure of space) with many discrete and separate particles.
please help share 
      this knowledge.
our existence in the universe is amazing, our bodies subtly connected to 
      all this other matter in the space around us (this is why we can see and 
      interact with it). currently humanity does not live from these 'connected' 
      foundations, and this 'insanity' 
      is causing the destruction of life on earth that will have catastrophic 
      consequences for all of us.
      the cure is a correct 
      understanding of physical reality and the necessary truths that are derived 
      from this. there are many others who now realise this, that truth is 
      the most powerful force for changing the world and saving humanity.

2. latest essays
the following articles have been re-written recently. they are the most 
      important / useful pages for understanding how the wsm works, why i am convinced 
      it is true.
a 
      letter to philosophers, physicists, scientists ... it is an open letter to philosophers 
      and scientists explaining a remarkable discovery i have only recently stumbled 
      upon. if you describe reality most simply, from just plane waves flowing 
      through space in all directions, you find that space vibrates in two different 
      ways that correspond to the quantum field and the particle. you can then 
      deduce the dirac equation (using complex quaternion wave functions) and 
      from this foundation you can then deduce all the main equations of modern 
      physics. it is simple, yet it evolves amazing complexity!
quaternions 
      - my journey through quaternions, some observations, some questions. so 
      if you like maths then read it, get involved, help. it is fascinating, it 
      is profound!
"time is said to have only one dimension, and space to have three 
      dimensions. ... the mathematical quaternion partakes of both these elements; 
      in technical language it may be said to be 'time plus space', or 'space 
      plus time': and in this sense it has, or at least involves a reference to, 
      four dimensions. and how the one of time, of space the three, might in the 
      chain of symbols girdled be."
      (william rowan hamilton)
"if quaternions are used consistently in theoretical physics, 
      we get a complete description of the physical world, with relativistic and 
      quantum effects easily taken into account. thus hamiltonâs idea, which motivated 
      more then half of his professional life, that quaternions are a fundamental 
      building block of the physical universe, appears to be essentially correct 
      in the light of contemporary knowledge." 
(note) this knowledge of quaternions has not been incorporated into the site yet - there is 
      a lot more knowledge that can be now added, a few errors that need correction. 
      
 truth 
      statements on physical reality - these truth statements show people 
      how to deduce physical reality for themselves and confirm it is true. it 
      also provides a very concise summary of the central things the wsm explains. 
      see if you can show any statement is not true.
wave 
      equation in an elastic wave medium - deducing the famous energy equations, 
      einstein's e=mc2, planck's e=hf and newton's f=ma from simple 
      wave equations in an elastic medium (space). this confirms that the equivalence 
      of matter and energy is because matter is made of waves, and waves propagate 
      energy. all forces are due to changes in wave velocity.
the 
      laws of nature - the wave structure of matter (wsm) deduces the laws 
      of nature that have been empirically observed and quantified over the past 
      several centuries. this changes the foundations of science / physics from 
      inductive (uncertain) to deductive (certain).
metaphysics 
      - solving the central problem of metaphysics - what is the one active substance 
      that causes and connects the many changing material things we experience. 
      the solution is simple, space is a wave medium and contains wave motions. 
      i.e. from the motion of matter particles in space and time, to the wave 
      motion of space that causes matter and time. 
cosmology - explaining 
      how our observable universe exists as a finite spherical region of infinite 
      eternal space.
theology 
      god religion - defining god in terms of the one infinite eternal substance 
      that exists.
free 
      will vs. determinism - how we can have limited freedom and limited determinism 
      in a necessarily interconnected reality of waves in space.
the 
      insanity of humanity - a list of the insane things that we are doing 
      on earth that are causing the destruction of nature 
      and the pollution of air, water and food - basically destroying / poisoning 
      the things that we depend upon for our future survival. (i hope people will 
      contribute to the list.)

3. the four main purposes of this website
the 
      task is not so much to see what no one yet has seen, but to think what no 
      body yet has thought about that which everyone sees. ... but life is short, 
      and truth works far and lives long: let us speak the truth. (arthur 
      schopenhauer, 1818)
(note: the following may be a bit abrupt / absolute - it is 
      written with those wonderful ideals of albert einstein in mind, kindness, 
      beauty and truth!)
1. to help people understand truth and reality
true knowledge of physical reality provides us with an absolute foundation 
      for working out the truth for ourselves (to prevent us from being deceived 
      by cultural myths and past customs).
      the central point to emphasise is that the solution is deduced using the 
      accepted rules of science - most importantly occam's 
      razor / principle of simplicity and metaphysics 
      / dynamic 
      unity of reality. this forces us to describe reality in terms of one 
      substance, space, and its wave motions that form matter (no opinions).
the 
      first philosophy (metaphysics) is universal and is exclusively concerned 
      with primary substance. ... and here we will have the science to study that 
      which is, both in its essence and in the properties which, just as a thing 
      that is, it has. ... that among entities there must be some cause which 
      moves and combines things. ... there must then be a principle of such a 
      kind that its substance is activity. (aristotle, 340bc)
it is also a significant fact that there is not another page on the internet 
      that considers what the most 
      simple science theory of reality is - which is strange given occam's 
      razor (principle of simplicity) is fundamental to science. thus it seems 
      premature to claim science does not really work (the 
      logical positivist / social construct view of postmodern science) without 
      having considered this most simple solution (which is actually very obvious 
      once known!).
 2. to realise that we are structures of the universe (our senses of discrete 
      and separate bodies are incomplete and deceptive)
 when we see things as being separate and discrete (like the human body) 
      this is an illusion (naive real). in reality matter (and thus all people) 
      are wave 
      structures of the universe, vibrating / resonating with everything in 
      the space around you. we are all subtly interconnected to all other matter 
      in the observable 
      universe because we are universal creatures (which is why we can see 
      those stars spread across the universe, because we are a part of them, they 
      a part of us). thus seeing our bodies as discrete and separate objects is 
      an an illusion of our limited senses (as representations of the mind).
      this is the enlightenment 
      that mystics / spiritualists and great scientists like albert 
      einstein realised.
a 
      human being is part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in 
      time and space. we experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something 
      separate from the rest. a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. this 
      delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires 
      and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. our task must be to free 
      ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace 
      all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty… the true 
      value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense 
      in which they have obtained liberation from the self. … we shall require 
      a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive. (albert 
      einstein, 1954)
3. to solve the central problems of knowledge.
 by understanding matter's (our) true 
      spatially extended nature we can easily understand the necessary connection 
      between things existing in space (imagine spherical waves in space flowing 
      through one another). this explains how the earth can orbit the sun, how 
      we can see the stars in the night sky, i.e. these 'forces of light and gravity' 
      that extend across the observable universe.
      from this knowledge of necessary connection we can then solve 
      the problems of science, of physics, 
      logic 
      and mathematics, philosophy, 
      metaphysics, 
      theology 
      and our evolution 
      and ecology.
      (there are many problems to explain, caused by the current discrete particle 
      conception of matter, as modern academia well realises).
when 
      forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence:
time and space and gravitation 
      have no separate existence from matter. ... 
      physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended. 
      in this way the concept 'empty space' loses its meaning. ... since the theory 
      of general relativity implies the representation of physical reality by 
      a continuous field, the concept of particles or material points cannot play 
      a fundamental part, ... and can only appear as a limited region in space 
      where the field strength / energy density are particularly high. (albert 
      einstein, 1950) 
 4. to help humanity by sharing this knowledge with others
this is one of the wonderful things about the internet. people can be free 
      individuals and yet also work together on the internet to correct past errors 
      both in human knowledge and in human society - and thus contribute to a 
      better 
      future for humanity.
      most importantly, this knowledge of our dynamic 
      unity with the world around us provides the foundations for the ecology 
      of life on earth and why the preservation 
      of nature is critical for our future survival. i.e. by knowing our true 
      nature, we realise that we are a part of nature, of the ecology of life 
      on earth as part of a larger ecology of matter in the observable universe 
      (our true selves). we then realise how important it is to reverse the current 
      destruction of nature - which is effectively destroying us / our future 
      survival. as david 
      bohm writes so profoundly;
the 
      notion that all these fragments is separately existent is evidently an illusion, 
      and this illusion cannot do other than lead to endless conflict and confusion. 
      indeed, the attempt to live according to the notion that the fragments are 
      really separate is, in essence, what has led to the growing series of extremely 
      urgent crises that is confronting us today. thus, as is now well known, 
      this way of life has brought about pollution, destruction of the balance 
      of nature, over-population, world-wide economic and political disorder and 
      the creation of an overall environment that is neither physically nor mentally 
      healthy for most of the people who live in it. individually there has developed 
      a widespread feeling of helplessness and despair, in the face of what seems 
      to be an overwhelming mass of disparate social forces, going beyond the 
      control and even the comprehension of the human beings who are caught up 
      in it. (david bohm, wholeness and the implicate order, 
      1980)
true 
      knowledge of reality has the potential to save humanity from disaster 
      - but it achieves nothing unless people are aware of it - and that is something 
      that depends on you (the best we can do is to present this knowledge as 
      simply, concisely and clearly as we can - the pages are getting better, 
      we are working hard!).
we 
      must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing 
      situation is possible without a severe struggle; for the handful of those 
      who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the 
      mass of the lukewarm and the misguided. (albert einstein, 1934)

ignorance  more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science. ...
    although i am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume i by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. but i look with confidence to the future to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. (charles darwin, introduction to the descent of man, 1871)

help humanity
"you must be the change you wish to see in the world."
        (mohandas gandhi)
"when forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence: 
        time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter. ... physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially    extended. in this way the concept 'empty space' loses its meaning. ... the particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which 
        the field strength or the energy density are particularly high. ...
        the free, unhampered exchange of ideas and scientific conclusions is necessary for the sound development of science, as it is in all spheres 
        of cultural life. ... we must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing situation is possible without 
        a severe struggle; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm 
        and the misguided. ...
humanity is going to need a substantially new way of thinking if it is to survive!" (albert einstein)

 
        our world is in great trouble due to human behaviour founded on myths and customs, combined with a deliberate censoring of truth, to maintain power for a wealthy oligarchy (while enslaving the majority with debt). this relentless pursuit of profit and power over truth and wisdom is causing the destruction of nature, threating our future survival.
		  we can now deduce the most simple science theory of reality - the wave structure of matter in space. by understanding how we and everything around us are interconnected 
        in space we can then deduce solutions to the fundamental problems of human knowledge in physics, philosophy, metaphysics, theology, education, health, evolution and ecology, politics and society.

        this is the profound new way of thinking that einstein 
        realised, that we exist as spatially extended structures of the universe - the discrete and separate body an illusion. this simply confirms the 
        intuitions of the ancient philosophers and mystics.

given the current censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals (based on the standard model of particle physics / big bang cosmology) the internet is the best hope for getting new knowledge 
        known to the world. but that depends on you, the people who care about science and society, realise the importance of truth and reality.

it is easy to help!
just click on the social network links below, or copy a nice image or quote you like and share it. we have a wonderful collection of knowledge from the greatest minds in human history, so people will appreciate your contributions. in doing this you will help a new generation of scientists see that there is a simple sensible explanation of physical reality - the source of truth and wisdom, the only cure for the madness of man! thanks! geoff haselhurst (updated september, 2018)
a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die,  and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. (max planck, 1920)
