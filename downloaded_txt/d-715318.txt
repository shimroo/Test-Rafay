dj tom stephan (aka superchumbo)i'm a little lazy, but i actually a month or so back went to see this dj and meant to write about him but hell i'm doing it now. i went to see tom stephan at our only afterhours in boston, rise and it was awsome, it was very trancey, but he also kicked it with some of his popular tunes which i listed below. if he's in your town u need to see him. check out some of his tunes see what u think. i'm sure you'll luv his songs. it's nice loud and make u wanna shake it. - goldfrapp - number 1- africanism - hard- believe in love - roger sanchez - turn on the music- cevin fisher -waiting in the darkness- murk - believe

byron stingly - u turn me this classic song makes me want to dance everytime i hear it.  it's mixes well with lots of other songs.  not many other songs from this person really stand out and i'm pretty sure you can't find it on itunes but if you can get ahold of this song give it a listen it's one of the greatest techno songs.

about me

name:  shockingly tasty 
location:  san francisco, california, united states 
merri has taken over shockingly tasty for now while my shockingly tasty partner is busy with other things...  

slightly ditzy, i have a short attention span. i am quite the opposite of a neat freak..you won't find me drinking beer and watching sports at a bar, not dressed up all fancy in high heels listening to downtempo or really boring trance in lounges and clubs. no hard rap or hip hop clubs for me either. i'm the girl who's there with the boys, glistening adorably in my tank top, sneakers and jeans, dancing all night to hard vocal house/trance and loving it. besides music and dancing, i love to write, read, watch movies and tv, though i dont go to the movie theatre or i fall asleep (short attention span!). i'm working out at the gym, maybe at one of my other meetings to meet people and be sociable, or at home wathing tv or writing. i like museums and tea, hate pretentious people. i'm just girly enough. i love cartoons, am loving technology and computers more all the time... i hate gooshy stuff...
