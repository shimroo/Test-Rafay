oppose h.r. 28 to protect civil rights



jan 15, 2025




on behalf of the leadership conference on civil and human rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the civil and human rights of all persons in the united states, and the 405 undersigned organizations, we call for the full inclusion, protection, and celebration of transgender, nonbinary, and intersex youth, including access to extracurricular activities such as athletics, and to school facilities, safe and inclusive school environments, and accurate and inclusive curriculum. we reject h.r. 28, the so-called protection of women and girls in sports act of 2025, because it would harm women

pride at work joined a groundswell of unions and workers today outside the department of labor to challenge elon muskâ€™s illegal power grabs for billionaires.

we wonâ€™t stand by while an unaccountable union buster tries to fire federal workers and gut essential services working people rely on every day.

join @afgeunion in solidarity for a rally to save the civil service act on february 11th at upper senate park, constitution ave in washington, d.c.

extreme policy proposals, budget cuts, privatization efforts, and attempts to undermine collective bargaining threaten federal employees and the public services they deliver.  the apolitical civil service is a cornerstone of our constitutional democracy and we must defend it from corruption and political interference.

#solidarityforever #afge #rally










in an attempt to divide our community and erase transgender, non-binary, and intersex people, the state department changed its website guidance for lgbtqi+ travelers to "lgb" travelers.

let's be clear: lgbtqia+ siblings stand united! ðŸ’ª
trans, non-binary, and intersex people cannot be erased! âœŠ










this black history month, letâ€™s take a moment to celebrate the incredible strength and contributions of black people throughout history. 

today is also a reminder that the battle against racism and fascism is ongoing and we must stand together against fascism from those in power. we need to continue to uplift all marginalized voices and push back against injustice. solidarity for all, means all.
