don't just take our word for it


we were in the lake george area on vacation and decided to go to the rodeo and bbq. the staff was super friendly and helpful. the bbq was great, with lots of sides and even dessert. we all enjoyed our first rodeo. love that everyone sings the anthem and says the cowboy prayer. the different rodeo sports they competed in were action packed and exciting. we had a wonderful time. i definitely recommend attending.

one of the most amazing experiences i have had with my family. my two daughters absolutely love it from beginning to end. their favorite was the womens barrel racing. so empowering and inspiring to see women do this. my six year old is now trying to convince us to buy her a horse. my husband and i love the bbq dinner before the rodeo. the ribs were superb. needless to say we will definitely do it again when we visit lake george next summer. thank you for the great experience and for keep american culture alive.

a fun family night out at the rodeo. we loved that they honored all veterans and said a thoughtful prayer about the participants and the animals before they began. great events and good food. we will definitely be back!
