      football league in 1892. some 500 men are listed, with details of birth,
      marriage and death, other clubs played for, and details of the footballing
      and commercial careers. some sample pages will be found inside.
because of the period
      under consideration, the book delves into the development of the sport,
      the ever-changing town, other nottingham clubs, and where games were
      played, there are results and line-ups for the statisticians to study.
