dear brothers and sisters in christ,
in the first two centuries there were three different st. valentines, and all three were martyred. how is that for a lovely picture on this celebration of valentines day ð.   there are a number of legends associated with the founding of this holiday. according to one, emperor claudius ll had banned young men from marrying, believing that single men, free of loveâs distractions, made better soldiers. st. valentine, a believer in loveâs power, secretly wed young couples until his actions were discovered and for this he lost his life.  another  legend claims that while imprisoned for helping christians escape imprisonment, st. valentine sent the first âvalentineâ card to his love, which was likely to have been the daughter of the jailor.  he signed the card, âfrom your valentine.â  whether these legends are true or not, we are fairly certain that this holiday has its origin in christian circles.  in john 13:35a jesus says âa new commandment i give to you, that you love one another: just as i have loved you, you also are to love one another.â   christians have a deep and abiding understanding of love.  why?   we know and are known by the savior jesus christ.  his unconditional love sent to sinners like us, is the underlining power in our love for others.  the golden rule is great, but this kind of love is far greater.    have a blessed valentines day, and iâll see you in church.
yours in christ,
pastor krenz

sunday/monday service theme:  âresurrection remindersâ 1 corinthians 15:1-20.
adult bible class  9:15 am  revelation   highlights:  join us on sunday mornings as we continue our study of the book of revelation. this class will cover key chapters and themes in this encouraging but often misunderstood book. this week we look at the seven seals and seven trumpets from rev. 7-8.childrenâs sunday school today, we will study âthe faith-full friends.â  the bible tells us david and jonathan were such close friends that âthe soul of jonathan was knit to the soul of davidâ (1 samuel 18:1). saulâs insane jealousy of david tests their friendship to the limit. david and jonathan establish a plan to alert david if saul continues to seek his life. sadly, saulâs anger remains unchecked. jonathan, faithful to godâs will, warns david to flee from the king.next food pantry:  february 19, 2025 1:30 pm to 3 pm  pantry needs: brownie mix; ravioli

due to the recent freeze in federal funds for several refugee services, many are turning to this and other christian organizations for assistance.   
this past summer our youth group spent two saturdays helping out at a refugee center.  
you can help in the following ways. 
â¢ donating essential household items     (e.g., cleaning supplies, toiletries, kitchen essentials)
â¢ providing grocery gift cards for refugee families in urgent need
â¢ making a financial contribution to sustain this critical work
each of the above options to take action is   available here: www.cfna-stl.org/donate
