malaysian food and top ten must eats





eating is a favourite pastime in malaysia. i don't know if it was a malaysian who coined the term 'live to eat', but other than visiting the mall, malaysians eat, eat and eat. in fact, we eat at anytime of the day. or night. or even midnight. yes, there are plenty of 24 hours restaurants called 'mamaks' that cater to our midnight hunger pangs. in fact, the stereotype of a malaysian is that he eats not just during breakfast, lunch and dinner, but in between as well! this used to be such a problem in civil service that the government had to eliminate brunch time in order to increase productivity!in fact, in malaysia, very often people do not say, "how are you?". instead, they say, "sudah makan?", which means, "have you eaten?"it's not surprising that malaysia is truly a paradise for food lovers. being a multi cultural and multi racial society, not only do we have the best food from each culture, cultural integration produces even more types of foods.let me introduce to you the cuisines of the three main races in malaysia- malay, chinese and indian. if you have tried chinese or indian food before and think you've tasted it all, think again. malaysian chinese and indian food have adapted to the local palate and have evolved into cuisines of their own. and like other cuisines, there are many regional variations, but here i will give you a general overview.malaycooking stylelet's begin with malay food. malay cuisine uses many types of fresh aromatic herbs and roots such as lemongrass, ginger, garlic, shallots and chillies. many of these herbs and roots are native to this region. spices are also important and they are called 'rempah'. another important ingredient is coconut milk, which is added to make a dish creamy and rich. there is also a key ingredient called 'belacan', which is a fermented paste made from tiny baby shrimps mixed with salt and chillies.typical mealyou can find malay food everywhere in malaysia. a typical meal that you might order is a rice dish with dried anchovies, cucumber, peanuts and a hard boiled egg, together with the meat of your choice, called 'nasi lemak'. the rice is cooked in coconut milk. you might even order plain rice and usually accompanied by three side dishes of your choice, such as chicken, mutton, or beef and a variety of vegetables- all cooked in malay style. accompanying your dish, you could have beef soup which is called 'sup lembu'; or mutton soup which is called 'sup kambing' - two very popular malay soups. to wash it down, you may order a refreshing cordial drink called 'air sirap'; or a cordial drink with condensed milk called 'ais bandung'.other delicaciesother malay delicacies include fish mousse, grilled slowly over a fire, called 'otak-otak' and a noodle dish garnished with cucumber, onion, and lettuce served in savoury fish soup called 'laksa'. there are many regional variations of 'laksa', so try one in every state. there is also a malay salad, which is called 'ulam'; consisting of a combination of fresh aromatic herbs; mint, basil, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, turmeric leaves, and raw vegetables like bean sprouts, long green beans, shallots, and cucumber. instead of thousand island dressing, the topping is a combination of salted fish, dried prawns, fish crackers, fried grated coconut, and other savory garnishes.if you're in kelantan, which is the north-eastern state of the peninsula, try this regional dish that serves blue rice with a variety of side dishes, it's called nasi kerabu. the blue colour is a result of the cooking process, where certain types of herbs are thrown into the water during the cooking of the ricedessertfor dessert, try a bread-like puff with sugar, corn, and coarsely chopped nuts in the middle called 'apam balik'.chinesecooking stylenext, we move onto chinese food. chinese food is typically considered milder in spiciness, but chinese cuisine in malaysia has taken a spicier touch. chinese cuisine is varied, but in malaysia the style is generally the cantonese style of cooking. a common way of cooking is stir fry. cantonese cuisine balances the yin and the yang, of food, a difficult concept to describe. you may hear people refer to it as the cooling or "heaty" effects of food. for example vegetables, some fruits and soup are considered cooling and meat is considered heaty.typical meala typical chinese meal can be found easily in many restaurants and hawker stalls in malaysia. you can also go to a 'kopitiam', which is a traditional chinese cafe. you might order 'economy rice', which has rice and a variety of side dishes. a common practice is to choose three side dishes- one meat, one vegetable and the last, a dish like tofu or egg. you might also order a noodle dish. there are many styles of cooking noodles such as cantonese or hokkien style. you can try the fried noodle with eggs, cockles and bean sprouts called 'char kuey tiao', or chinese noodles with dumplings and roast pork called 'wan tan mee'. you could also order thick noodles fried with black sauce and pork lard called 'hokkien mee'. chicken rice is also very popular in malaysia. to wash it down, you could order chinese tea, or herbal tea.other delicaciesother delicacies include chinese spring rolls stuffed with steamed vegetables, bean sprouts, turnip and carrot, called 'popiah'. another popular dish here is the pork rib soup called 'bak kut the'. the soup is cooked for many hours with garlic, pork ribs and a variety of herbs. chinese dumplings are also a must-try. they are glutinous rice wrapped in a leaf along with pork, mushrooms, nuts and salted duck egg yolk. if you have heard of 'dim sum' before, you must try the malaysian version. it is basically an assortment of bite size dishes, including seafood, meat and vegetables. dim sum is usually eaten in the morning.dessertfor dessert, a well-loved chinese dessert is curdled soy bean milk topped with syrup called 'tao foo fah'.indiancooking styleindian cooking is of course, very spicy and hot. it has also adapted to the local culture to create a new type of cuisine. most of the indian food in malaysia (comes from) from southern india, but north indian food is also widely available. spices are the heart and soul of indian cooking. spices like coriander, cumin, turmeric, fennel, cardamom, clove, cinnamon and star anise are widely used.typical mealindian food is easily available in malaysia. for a typical meal, you might want to have rice served on a banana leaf, accompanied by a variety of spicy hot dishes such as mutton, chicken, fish, squid and crabs. or you might order bread, and there are many types of them. to name a few, thin rice pancakes or 'thosai', fermented rice and dhal or 'vadai', wheat bread or 'chapati', flour bread or 'roti canai'. or you may also be interested in chicken tandoori- that's chicken slowly grilled in a clay oven.other delicaciesthere are 24 hour restaurants open if you're suffering from a midnight hunger pang. affectionately called 'mamak', they have been institutionalized as a malaysian icon. mamaks are run usually by indian muslims. if westerners hang out at bars, malaysians hang out mamaks. mamak food is distinct, and a popular drink here is the 'the tarik', or tea with condensed milk. other popular food you can order in a mamak is the 'maggie goreng', which is fried maggi instant noodle with eggs, vegetables and meat.dessertfor dessert, you may be interested in a sweet dish of rice noodles topped with coconut and coconut palm sugar called 'putu mayam.'other cuisinesthere are many other types of cuisines in malaysia, such as nyonya cuisine, which is the cooking of the straits chinese. straits chinese trace their ancestors to malays and chinese, and their cooking combines the styles of these two races. i'd recommend a chicken stew cooked with salted soy beans and coconut palm sugar called 'ayam pongteh'; and a chicken dish cooked with nuts from a type of mangrove tree found in malaysia, which is called 'ayam buah keluak'.the portuguese, one of the many colonialists who set foot in malaysia, left their mark too on local cooking. one (example) is the devil's curry, a dish made from vinegar, herbs and nuts and plenty of chilli- hence its name devil's curry.top ten must eatsalright. it's now time for the top ten must try foods in malaysia. as with all cuisines, it is very difficult to compile a list of only ten, especially in malaysia where there are definitely more than ten foods you must try!however, if i were to compile a list, it would look like this:number one.nasi lemak. this is the national dish of malaysia. nasi lemak literally means 'rice in cream'. there are many regional variations, but the most common ones consist of steamed rice that is cooked with coconut milk and pandan leaves, which is a kind of plant indigenous to this region. traditionally served on banana leaf, the rice is topped with cucumber slices, dried anchovies, roasted nuts and hard-boiled egg. but the most important ingredient is the 'sambal', a kind of hot spicy sauce made from chilli, pepper and spices. in fact, how delicious a nasi lemak is really depends on how well the 'sambal' is made! most people will eat nasi lemak accompanied by a dish like chicken, cuttle fish, cockles, beef, or beef rendang which is beef cooked in dried spices, and vegetables.number two. bak kut teh. the name translates into 'meat bone tea'. this chinese dish is a soup with pork ribs, herbs and garlic cooked for many hours. other ingredients include mushrooms, internal organs, and dried tofu. green onions and fried shallots are sometimes added in as well. bak kut teh is served with rice and 'you tiao', which are long fried pieces of dough. chopped garlic and chilli in soy sauce served in tiny plates often accompany this dish. chinese tea is a very important part of this dish and is drunk to balance the taste. try bak kut teh for an authentic chinese meal.number three. laksa. yet another favourite malaysian dish, laksa has many different regional variations. the more common one is the asam laksa. it is a sour fish- based soup where the main ingredients are shredded fish, usually mackerel, and finely sliced vegetables including cucumbers, onions, red chillis, pineapple, lettuce, mint, and ginger buds. thick white noodles are then added into the soup. to top it off, a thick sweet shrimp paste is added. other variations of laksa are laksa sarawak, laksa penang, laksa kedah, laksa ipoh, laksa kuala kangsar, laksa kari, laksa johor, laksa kelantan, laksam, laksa lemak and many more.number four. satay. you might have heard of this one before. it's basically skewered meat served with peanut sauce, cucumber, onions and rice cakes. the choice of meat is varied- you can choose deer meat, rabbit meat and even fish, but the most common are chicken and beef. the marinated meat is skewered on bamboo sticks and grilled over charcoal.number five. char kway teow. it literally means 'stir fried rice cake strips'.  flat rice noodles are fried together with chilli, prawns, cockles, eggs, bean sprouts and vegetables. sometimes it is fried with pork lard. it also has many regional variations, but the most famous one is the penang char kway teow.number six. nasi kandar. a popular north malaysia meal that originated in penang, nasi kandar is widely available. it has rice, and a variety of spicy side dishes to choose from. in fact, it is the spices that make nasi kandar so unique. the dishes are laid like a buffet and you have to point to the side dishes that you want. after you have chosen your side dishes, the waiter will pour a variety of curries onto your plate, and this process is called 'banjir' or 'to flood'. if you can't take spicy food, ask for less curry.number seven. roti canai. one of the most (widely consumed foods) in malaysia, roti canai is a type of flatbread that is available everywhere. it is round and flat, and is eaten with lentil curry called 'dhal'. you can ask for your roti canai to be made in many ways. the more popular variations are: with eggs or roti telur, with banana or roti pisang, made smaller but thicker or roti bom, made thin and flaky like tissue paper or roti tisu. you can even be more adventurous and ask for roti kaya, spread with malaysian jam made from coconut; or roti milo, with chocolate powder sprinkled on top. try a few and find your favourite roti!number eight. cendol. an all time favourite malaysian dessert, cendol consists of shaved ice, smooth green rice noodles in chilled coconut milk and coconut palm sugar, or gula melaka. sometimes, red beans, glutinous rice and corn are added. if you have a sweet tooth, ask for more gula melaka, as many malaysians do!number nine. teh tarik. the national drink of malaysia. it is tea sweetened with condensed milk, and can be ordered hot or iced. teh means tea in malay and tarik means to pull, jerk or tug. the milky tea is prepared by using out-stretched hands, pouring the piping hot tea from one mug to another several times. the higher the pull, the thicker the froth, the thicker the froth, the more delicious it is.number ten. i've saved this until the last because there are few things more divisive than this fruit. it is the durian. known as the king of fruits, you either love the durian or you hate it. its smell has been described as sweet, heavenly, fragrant, or disgusting, revolting and downright offensive. the smell evokes either deep appreciation or intense disgust. some have compared the smell of the durian to the civet, sewage, stale vomit, skunk spray and used surgical swabs. the british novelist anthony burgess describes the durian as, "like eating sweet raspberry blancmange in the lavatory". chef andrew zimmern compares the taste to "completely rotten, mushy onions."  anthony bourdain, while himself a lover of durian, says of it: "its taste can only be described as...indescribable, something you will either love or despise. your breath will smell as if you'd been french-kissing your dead grandmother." travel and food writer richard sterling says that its odor is best described as "pig-shit, turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock that can be smelled from yards away." it's no wonder durian is banned in most hotels and airlines.the durian is green in colour and has sharp thorns on the outside. inside, the flesh of the fruit is usually yellow, but the colour varies from species to species. durians used to be seasonal fruits, but with genetic modification, durians are now available all year around. this is either good news or bad news, depending on your feelings towards durians. the best place to get durians is directly from the orchards, but if you'd like to just sample a bite or two, you can get them at major supermarkets. just ask around.i encourage you to be adventurous and try the durian. however, if you are too overpowered by the strong smell, you can always try durian ice cream or durian cakes, though purists will swear it is not the same at all.so there you have it. the top ten must eats in malaysia. i hope you'll manage to try all ten.go out and explore. ask the locals where to find the best nasi lemak or bak kut the. everyone would have their favourites. it's time to find some malaysian food and start digging in. or as we say in malaysia, 'makan-makan' or 'let's start eating'.endthis is the end of malaysian food guide. i hope you've enjoyed learning about malaysian food. hopefully, this will give you a better understanding of the cuisines in malaysia, and a deeper appreciation of its food.

an overview of london hotels





london, being the capital of england and the united kingdom, is one of the top tourist destinations in the entire world. it is a melting pot of art, culture, fashion, and society. that is why it should come as no surprise why the city has thousands of hotels and lodging establishments to cater to the sheer demand of people visiting the city.there are london hotels that cater to the entire gamut of tourists, especially given that the london development agency says that the amount tourists spend in london amount to over £15 billion ($23.64 billion) annually. that is definitely a lot of tourists, and that entails a whole lot of revenue. london has all types of hotels that suit all sorts of needs and budgets, ranging from luxury hotels to more affordable bed & breakfasts and even backpacker hostels.for those who have quite a lot of money to spare, there are only 3 can't-miss luxury hotels: the ritz hotel london in piccadilly, claridge's in mayfair, and the savoy hotel located in central london's strand. staying at these opulent hotels entails a steep price-up to £1,000 (over $1,500) per night.the prices of accommodations in london largely depend on the location. those with a good measure proximity to the city's center and nearness to other landmarks and tourist attractions will of course tend to be more expensive. even 2-star or 3-star establishments can fetch upwards of £150 (nearly $235) per night if the location is right in central london. this scales higher as the stars go up.cheaper accommodations can be had, however. as with other major metropolitan areas, london offers hostels and apartments that are highly cost-effective if a tourist isn't too particular about room size, quality of furnishings, and sharing with others (for groups). sometimes, during the summer when school is out, certain university residence halls are made available for visitor accommodation. this is another option for those seeking budget accommodations.here's one good tip for visitors to london who want to save money on accommodations: more savings can be had by staying in a hotel somewhere farther from the central area of the city. even if the costs of transportation are factored in, there's a big difference compared to the amount one would spend on hotel rooms near the center. what's more, tourists can get to see more places by staying in the periphery.for those with cash, however, it is safe to simply say "go to town." it would be a shame not to experience the best of the best when it comes to london hotels. a night at the ritz or at the savoy would provide a memory to last a lifetime. moreover, getting to rest and relax at these famous establishments, with all the lavish furnishings and high-end services and world-class dinners, can be an adventure in itself.with the sheer number and variety of people visiting the uk capital of london year in and year out, it is only natural to have establishments that cater to every possible need of tourists and sightseers. it is only important to determine which aspects of london hotels to prioritize-cost versus convenience and comfort, among other things. regardless, one should be able to have the vacation of a lifetime.



































nana hotel bangkok - is it worth staying in?





the nana hotel in bangkok is arguably one of the most talked about hotels in bangkok. the major draw to this hotel is obviously nearby nana entertainment plaza, which is a 4 story den of sex and booze, and the parking lot outside of the nana hotel which is full of freelance prostitutes. there is so many mixed reviews about this place that it almost makes it impossible for anyone to decide whether to stay or not in this hotel. but most will agree, nana hotel is one of the most well known guest friendly hotel in bangkok. this means registered guest do not have to pay an additional fee or joiner fee for bringing in unregistered guest for an overnight stay.how do i know this? after living and working in bangkok for over five years i have become the unofficial tour guide for friends and friends of friends and so on. all of them eventually ask me "is the nana hotel a good place to stay in?".and my honest answer at the time was "i don't know, i live in an apartment." since i knew i was going to get asked that particular question time and time again i decided to follow along my friends (or guinea pigs) and see personally how the hotel looks from the inside out.the nana hotel is located on sukhumvit soi 4, in a mixed commercial zone that doubles as red-light district. scores of freelance prostitutes congregate in the surrounding areas especially outside of nana hotel's parking lot. this is definitely not a place to bring your family especially kids and grandparents. however, i do see them often, mostly europeans who are not so uptight about such spectacles. you can easily access the sky train at nana bts station with a 5 minute walk. the sky train will easily take you to the other attractions in bangkok.now, i'm not sure when the hotel was built exactly, but it's safe to say the 1970's is the first thing that comes to mind. the lobby is usually filled with backpacker types, young guys looking to sow their oats and a smattering of older folks looking for company that they otherwise never find back home. once i've seen a group of australians wearing rugby uniforms. are they actual athletes is a whole different subject. obviously a far cry from the days the hotel was first opened. i've read previous reviews about reception staff being rude and obnoxious to guests who are checking in.after living in bangkok for awhile i know the reason why. thai society follows a strict social order and is very class based. the better you look and present yourself, the more respect you get. so if you're checking in dressed like you're heading straight for the pool, forget about that much talked about gracious and beautiful thai smile. i'm not saying you have to dress like your heading to an important business meeting. a nice clean button shirt, pressed pants and clean shoes and you'll see your respect meter shoot up. you'll even get a better chance of scoring an upgrade or a room in excellent condition. by the way, this is true in any hotel in asia, actually most likely everywhere.it works time and time again whenever my friends check in. they don't always get a room upgrade, but they get rooms where they've never had to ask for a room change or find questionable carpet stains.the rooms here are the absolute bare basics. after-all the nana hotel is considered in the budget category. a bed, color television with international channels, mini fridge and a decently clean bathroom is what you get for around 1400 thb including taxes and a free buffet breakfast. a free daily newspaper is a nice added touch. housekeeping did there job quite well, or as best as they can, after all they have to clean up after piss drunk guests half the time.the nana hotel doesn't offer much in terms of facilities for guest use, just an adequate pool on the fourth floor and free wi-fi in the lobby. in the lobby is also where you can find angel's nana disco, a frequent freelance hangout. and since ladies enter for free you're going to find a lot there. definitely worth a visit.my final word here is the nana hotel in bangkok is a good choice for you if you want to mess around and have fun. but i wouldn't recommend staying here throughout your entire trip. it's best to stay there for 3 nights, enjoy the nightlife, and shift over to another hotel in a more quiet area. it's what i suggest to friends who come visit me in bangkok as the unofficial tour guide.
