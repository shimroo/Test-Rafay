psalm 45
for the director of music. to the tune of "lilies."

					of the sons of korah. a maskil. a wedding song.
my heart is stirred by a noble theme 
							  as i recite my verses for the king; 
							 my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
you are the most excellent of men 
							  and your lips have been anointed with grace, 

							  since god has blessed you forever. 
   					  		  gird your sword upon your side, o mighty one; 
 							  clothe yourself with splendor and majesty. 
  					    		  in your majesty ride forth victoriously 
							  in behalf of truth, humility and righteousness; 
							  let your right hand display awesome deeds. 

   					    		  let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; 
 							  let the nations fall beneath your feet. 
   					   		  your throne, o god, will last for ever and ever; 
							  a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. 
   					   		  you love righteousness and hate wickedness; 
 							  therefore god, your god, has set you above your companions 

							   by anointing you with the oil of joy. 
  					   		   all your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia; 
							   from palaces adorned with ivory 
							   the music of the strings makes you glad. 
   					     		   daughters of kings are among your honored women; 
 							   at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of ophir.
