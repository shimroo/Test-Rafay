origins of the project


philosophers such as noam chomsky or alain badiou have said that a quarter of humanity âdoes not really exist". they refer to people whom the current global capitalist system cannot find use for and who, therefore, live and die without leaving any trace of their existence. it is as if they are âinvisibleâ, condemned to disappear.when the media outlets talk about how many people have drowned in the sea, we should consider how many have drowned without us knowing? and how many people, who experience true odyssey and survive in precarious conditions, still live without the awareness of the rest of world? who actually knows who and where they are?the origin of this project started with the recording of a documentary that portrays some of those many and varied realities, all of which are extremely hard, but approached from a vital perspective far removed from sensationalism. it is a work made with sensitivity that has given rise to this tour project presented on this website, destined to make this humanitarian crisis more visible and to generate awareness.essentially, the more our governments turn their heads, the more people join and support projects such as this one. the situation requires urgency.

the we exist film


we exist is a 45-minute music documentary featuring solo musicians and groups from the middle east and africa, combined with associative images of people trying to escape danger, hunger and war around the mediterranean region. far removed from sensationalism, these poetic images bear witness to the true human dimension of this ongoing tragedy.a number of the musicians who perform their music in this film are from the refugee camps, some are regionally and internationally famous. the narrative structure and its story are different from conventional documentary filmmaking, reaching out to take us by the hand and move on with a sometimes devastating honesty. led by its music and free of gratuitous comment, we exist brings us to places and people that touch us on the deepest level.

postscreening & talks


the chats of the we exist tour project are ment to be a participatory and
informal space, where people who have lived closely the reality of immigration and the refugees share their experiences, from a humanist and respectful vision, far away from any sensationalism. immigrants and refugee people, social and cultural activists, humanitarian aid volunteers...that is why the people attending the chats usually respond in a particularly enthusiastic way. they are full of interest to know more about the subject, grateful to be able to approach a generally hidden reality, misrepresented by the media and the political class.the people who take part of the event depend on the city where the event is done, because we always try to work with local people and entities of the area,
especially when they are immigrants. on the other hand, there are more or less frequent participants, such as lucian segura, director of the documentary "we exist";, the film that is shown before the chat, and who tries to attend â whenever possible. he contributes with his testimony about the people he met and all he saw while shooting the film in refugee camps, borders, ghettos and conflictive zones in countries such as lebanon, greece, jordan, turkey, mali, spain, morocco, france, senegal or ethiopia. his journey was, somehow, the journey he shows in his documentary: knowing the reality first hand, through the people who lived it, without intermediaries.the sum of all these witness offers the general vision of the context and concrete causes, but always in a human, direct and honest way. there is the strength, showing reality from the real experience of real people.

we exist: why?


we exist tour project emerged from the urgent need to portray the drama of migration caused by poverty, war, injustice and the climate catastrophe from the perspective of its real protagonists: the refugees.we believe that the usual approach to this problem isoften eurocentric and simplistic. from this perspective, the real concern of the societies in which immigration takes place seems to be how the arrival of these people materially affects our lives.on the one hand you can see how the so-called "western states" concentrate the problem on the influx of people arriving. this is accompanied by a distorted narrative about the impossibility of receiving these people and a narrative of general phenomenon of insecurity, which is completely wrong and supported by the relevant media with biased information and fake news. in this way, they convince public opinion of the legitimacy to close borders and make admission-, support- and rescue-operations more difficult, while creating fear and hatred in our societies. in this way, they also justify their covert actions on the various existing migration routes, influence the border controls of the different countries that migrants cross, and thereby promote the spread of mafias for human trafficking, with whom they are often in direct contact. in this way, they also transfer responsibility to the coastal regions of the southern mediterranean, which public opinion then considers to be the main cause of the situation.on the other hand, we believe that besides the purely humanitarian approach that defends the "poor" 's right to emigrate and the necessary reception policies in "rich" countries, we have other fundamental aspects that we should focus on: these are the real causes that cause people to migrate. it is important to understand that refugees do not "come" to our countries, but "flee" from their own countries. they are fleeing the misery and wars that rich countries in a criminal way are causing, to keep control over the natural resources that feed our consumer- and affluent-society. in addition, the most conservative sectors of our society respond to purely humanitarian approaches by exploiting the fear that has arisen and promoting hate speech and racism. in this way, they portray people as a threat, who are in fact the main victims of a privileged lifestyle, namely ours, which is based on aggressive and immoral geopolitics, regardless of justice or human dignity.we exist tour project is therefore trying to get people to think and act, trying to use the empathy or antipathy that everyone could feel towards migratory movements, to focus the debate on the global south. but further south of the borders imposed by europe and the usa: to africa, asia and latin america. we want to talk about the reality of the places of origin from which the refugees are fleeing. but above all, about the reasons that compel them to leave their homes and families, and what main role we and our states play in all of this. because the poverty and violence from which the global south suffers has no "accidental", "biological" or "cultural" origin: the causes are political, economic, social and climatic and have their origins in the relationship that the global north has imposed on the global south for more than 500 years. because the opposite of poverty is not wealth, but justice.
