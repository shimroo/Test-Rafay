what is an attic tent ®

the attic tent ® is the ultimate attic access insulation cover ever invented (attic stairs, scuttle holes, knee-wall doors, and full-size doors.) its primary design is to stop air infiltration between the home and attic, the most common medium for wasting costly residential energy, during both hot and cold seasons. the hvac systems in homes are designed for a closed envelope making air balancing with supply and return air, very critical. every time these systems are operating they create a positive or negative pressure, thus forcing conditioned air out or drawing outside air in the home. it also keeps out unhealthy insulation and dust particles from the attic.

wasted energy
heating and cooling inefficiencies are the major cause. in most cases, the prevention is simple and inexpensive.
the attic tent is an easy and affordable do-it-yourself solution for making your home more comfortable and less expensive to heat in the winter and cool in the summer!
the attic tent also stops humidity from entering your home.


windows & storm doors
each year hundreds of thousands of homeowners pay large sums of money to purchase and install energy efficient windows and doors in their homes.
yet, they overlook the area recognized as one of the home's hot spots for energy loss — the attic opening!
it isn't their fault; before the invention of the attic tent ® there was no practical solution.
