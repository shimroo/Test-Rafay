intuition is the substance of my art and life. process painting is what i do, across various mediums: i paint the moment; it is a call, a necessity. it often unfolds beyond any justification or reasoning; i plainly act. my process is not constrained by technique or a need for progressing; it’s for painting—{act/fact}—to exist; to listen and to act—{listen/act}.
