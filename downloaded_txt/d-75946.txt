having the reputation of being the best school of its kind, with the most thoroughly researched courses in many spiritual subjects, university of metaphysical sciences   has set new standards in the field of metaphysics that other schools 
        have  yet to achieve. university of metaphysical sciences was the first to see a real need for a structured  educational path in the many areas that metaphysics covers. ums is continually researching, developing new courses, and expanding as the  emerging field of metaphysical education and careers continues to expand, evolve and grow. no other metaphysical education compares to 
        ums. it is a dynamic university that grows with the changes as humanity awakens, discovers  and evolves. 
what the courses are like 
students learn about prominent  spiritual concepts and methods offered by spiritual traditions, teachers, and writers throughout the world. besides receiving  extensive written material, which serves as a reference library you will utilize many times in the future, you also receive meditation 
        classes on cd or downloadable mp3 formats. the meditations guide you through various techniques that would be taught 
        in a live classroom situation. this way  you still get  the experiential aspects 
      of a metaphysical education as if you were attending a live class. 
you can  talk with faculty and other ums students about   course subjects in our online interactive functions, including the exam dialogues with ums teachers, forums,  chatrooms, webinars, and teleconferences.

        designed to give  students a well-rounded education in metaphysics. as a practitioner, healer,        teacher  or leader, the graduate will be more effective in 
        his or her work with others after an education at ums. 
ums  in other countries 
ums is also in the process of opening branches in other countries, translating  course materials into other languages, and creating global connections and community between  like minded people on the planet. utilizing  interactive online methods to bring a global community together, ums is launching new ways for students as well as non-students to  connect with each other no matter where they are in the world.

      is  a true non-profit 501(c)3 organization and keeps its prices as low as possible so people of all income levels can study and attain their degrees.

        this day and age of coming need, people will be turning to spiritual teachers, 
        healers and leaders for answers in their search for truth. it is becoming 
        increasingly important for metaphysical teachers and healers, who will 
        be assisting others in understanding their spiritual nature, to have credentials 
        and a comprehensive education in metaphysics. the university of metaphysical 
      sciences (ums) is here to meet that need.
having a degree gives prestige 
        and professionalism to your practice, classes, or other endeavors. it 
        shows that you have taken the time to get an education, which takes a 
        certain level of commitment and knowledge. it will be quite useful if 
        you plan on writing books, teaching classes, healing, counseling, or traveling the lecture circuit. there are many opportunities 
        in these respected careers if you have a ph.d. or d.d.

        and the advanced student. for advanced students who have been practicing 
        metaphysics for many years, the curriculum 
        will fill in the gaps in their knowledge. as a beginner, the student will 
        find most of the common concepts in spirituality metaphysics organized in one place in an orderly fashion, 
        instead of having to piece it together with self help books and workshops. 
        in the long run, attending university of metaphysical sciences is more 
        cost effective.

        interests the student deeply. an education at university of metaphysical 
        sciences is an investment well worth the good it will do for a career
