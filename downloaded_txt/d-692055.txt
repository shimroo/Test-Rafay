proception products


rf, hdmi and wi-fi

proception products are designed with attention to detail to ensure they are fit for purpose for the evolving market. please see below some of the advantages of their design.
rf spectrum efficient
nowadays, within the vhf and uhf spectrum, there is a wide level of interference; proception products are designed where required to mitigate the effects of both in-band signal handling and out-of-band interference. they are extremely resilient to interference and overloading, can cope with multiple carriers and promote efficient use of the radio spectrum.
where strong lte is a problem, we offer the choice to fit in-line filters rather than automatically incorporating them in areas where they are not required. this has the advantage of keeping a low noise level for improved signal handling.
products that provide stop band or overlap blocking filtering are offered as required to eliminate or reduce interference to provide a good signal at the required delivery point. by using proception products alone or in combination, protection of up to 55db can be achieved. tetra filtering is also incorporated in proception products as appropriate to provide up to 30db attenuation below 400mhz and excellent immunity to out-of-band signals.
with proception products providing high performance, great internal immunity, low noise and protection to signal handling and out-of-band interference as standard, you can be confident of mitigating most problems.
power supplies and energy efficiency
with energy costs still rising rapidly and global warming an ongoing issue, it is good to know that proception power supplies are built with energy efficiency in mind. 
this means less emissions, lower running costs to the consumer, and enhanced reliability as the units run cooler. on top of this, high-quality proception components are chosen with the correct power ratings to help ensure trouble-free operation and long product lifetimes.
regulatory compliance
all relevant proception products are independently tested and certified for compliance with all relevant emc and safety standards by a leading test laboratory. where applicable products are ce marked to show compliance to the relevant standards such as red (radio equipment directive - 2014/53/eu). as such, products comply with the restriction of hazardous substances (rohs) legislation and are weee-compliant under a registered producer scheme.
