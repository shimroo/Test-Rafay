trails & open space

trails, open space & parks (tops) 



tops vs. tosc confused? tops is the city tax. tosc is the organization that champions the tax and projects it supports. do you know how parks get built? where does the money for preserving open space come from?what are tops properties? 






what is tops? and why is it important?











take the one bag challenge. get more information on our initiative to encourage us all to keep our parks, trails, and open spaces litter-free.

our latest program 



ring the peak 



in december of 2016, the trails and open space coalition received a great outdoors colorado connect initiative trail planning grant for the ring the peak trail project. the $100,000 planning grant will allow tosc and partners (friends of the peak and city of colorado springs parks) to hire a project team and create a master plan for the roughly 8-mile “missing link” on the southwest side of pikes peak. this grant allows the trail and open space coalition to lead a great public process involving land owners, land managers, community leaders, residents and trail users. at the end of the process we will have a trail alignment plan that closes the southwest gap.
