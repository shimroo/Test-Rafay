halloween 2010



halloween, according to wikipedia, is an annual holiday observed on october 31, which unfortunately is a sunday this year. not sure if it is a holiday for adults, but if it were, well it is a sunday. halloween is celebrated across the united states, canada, ireland, and the united kingdom. even though i have seen pictures of halloween theme parties and other events organized by adults, i have no particular plans for the halloween. i think it is a kid's holiday, and i would just buy a bunch of candies and stock them up since i live in an apartment complex. i had planned to visit a friend, but realized that he has a kid and might have plans. i will most probably be watching some horror movies.for those who don't know much about halloween, these are some of the common halloween events and activities:trick-or-treating, wearing costumes and attending costume parties, carving jack-o'-lanterns, ghost tours, bonfires, apple bobbing, visiting haunted attractions, committing pranks, telling ghost stories or other frightening tales, and watching horror films. horror movies is what i will be doing :) here are some halloween quotes in case you want to send text messages or twit or update your statuses with some funny halloween quotes, and of course with the thanksgiving just round the corner here are also some thanksgiving quotes .. have a great holiday..

vanishing jobs and the downturn



the recession is for real down, and some experts are saying that this could turn into a depression anytime soon.whoever invested in the stock markets have burned themselves way above their fingers.i experienced what they call catching a falling knife when i reinvested everything around july august 2008 even though i exited at a good time earlier that year. and the job market is just horrible. the us legislators are reaching for the throats of immigrant workers and their visas, and free markets are re looking at their model.never mind that the unemployment would have worse in the us if they had not outsourced a lot of their jobs thereby giving the developing countries a share of their unemployment.all the jobs that have been shed in china and india would have been in the us but for outsourcing. add to the fact that if they hadn't outsourced, their profits would have been even lesser or the losses more and that would have contributed to the job loss.back to india, the job losses are getting real. one of friends had bought a house on a monthly emi of 50k and now he has been out of work for the past 4 months. there are rumors that some companies are having 25% salary cuts. some have delayed or cancelled new hiring.and friends and their friends never stop send me a resume or two every day. and these are all people with great academics and past performances, but hey are looking out at a time when people stick to where they are and no one is looking at their resume. the situation is bad, but when you write a resume that just don't stand out and which is 4 pages long, no one would look. least of all in times like this when hiring is low, and there are lots of good people on bench.but, that doesn't mean no one would hire. many people won't know, but companies do look for people in times like this, because these are the times when great assets can be found without having to pay outrageous salary hikes. people get reasonable in times like this and these are the best times for talent acquisition. but how do you tell your potential recruiter that you are an asset worth acquiring even in the bad times. you haven't even met your hiring manager? all he sees is an inbox full of potential candidates.it is your resume that he sees before he decides to talk to your a position. and it is very important that you give an impression to the hiring personnel what kind of a person you are. even before you have talked to him, you should have created a mental picture of yourself in his mind so that he remembers you from your resume.it should be 1 page long, 2 at most and must tell in a few lines what you are capable of? the manager doesn’t actually want to read the description of your project but what you have achieved doing that project, what your major contributions were. you should also remember to mention all your pat achievements. that you stood first in a class of 80 should come clearly too.and if you sound like what you written in the resume, then downturn or not you would have got the job!

cutting down on processed food!



i was talking to one of friends who is an amateur naturopath but a professional evangelist of naturopathy and as usual he started talking about how he reduced 13 kilos (25 pounds?) and so we started talking about cooking food with lesser quantities of oil. and that you can actually lose 7-8 pounds by eating about 3-4 hours prior to going to bed. this was interesting, because you don't need to make a drastic change. just start eating your dinner early early, which seem to be the first step towards a healthy eating style.and it works in a very simple way. we all burn energy while we sleep, and if there are some food in the stomach while we sleep, then our body just uses that food, whereas if your food is already digested, it will try to get energy from your reserves thereby burning those extra calories.then we talked about salt and how harmful our daily intake of salt is since we do take a lot of salt. i wondered how am i going to manage without salt when he said that it just takes 10 days to get used to it. start have lesser and lesser salt everyday and at the end of 10 days, you will not even feel it.another thing he suggested was to reduce out intake of processed food. we all do know that processed food has a lot of preservatives and other stuff that do no good for our body, but it also contains a lot of salt. just because ordered the pizza with a discounted price using dominos coupons, it doesn't come with less fats. and i have been trying hard these past couple of days to not buy any more canned and processed food. and i am taking lesser oil. that is the least i can do since its been 4 months that i stopped going to the gym, that reminds me to start hitting the gym.. ah... why do we have to go through all these :)

top 10 weird ways we deal with the dead 



here is something i came across in digg, more ways besides burials and cremation to deal with the dead.eg: zoroastrians bring their deceased to to a ceremonial "tower of silence", usually located on an elevated mountain plateau, and left exposed to the animals and elements.groups in australia, british columbia, the american southwest and siberia were known to practice tree burial, which involved wrapping the body in a shroud or cloth and placing it in a crook to decompose.weird, no?read more | digg story

monica medi jail nude pictures have been banned



the supreme court has banned nude pictures of monica bedi, taken while monica was lodged in a jail, to be telecasted on tv and other media. the supreme court barred the media on friday from showing nude photographs of former actress monica bedi, said to have been taken by a camera hidden in the bathroom of the jail where she was imprisoned over a forgery case.[source]the scandal starved media would have shown it anyway, but it is good that the supreme court is stopping it. but will the supreme court be able to stop some website from posting it on the net, on some torrent site or download site.there are many websites that posts torrent links or such movie clips for downloads. by banning it, people must bu now be frantically searching for the said videos, and people who would want to view the pictures or videos would have had it anyway.but, who would have filmed someone in the jail bathroom?labels: monica

easy to produce inexpensive solar panels



one of the reasons why solar panels have not been used popularly have been the huge upfront cost. govts have  subsidized it so that people embrace solar energy as an alternative source of energy. not it might become a little cheaper.researchers at new jersey institute of technology have developed an inexpensive solar cell that can be painted or printed on flexible plastic sheets.read more | digg story

sholay aur aag!



ram gopal varma's sholay will now be called ram gopal varma's aag. so much for trademark. sholay should now be sholay©.more than the name, sippy and party should be more worried about the theme, the story line or in other words, the content? copying or remaking a movie, isn't it akin to plagiarism?ah but then, sholay was a mashup of the spaghetti western which again was influenced by another akira movie.no wonder, they could only go after the name.labels: bollywood
