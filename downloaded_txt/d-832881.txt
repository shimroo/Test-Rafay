surgeries in michigan





today was a day with some problems, although by the time the dinner was served at applebees, it was the end of a very good day. at 4:20 a.m. alexia was having trouble breathing, so the doctors decided she needed to have a breathing tube put in place. once that was done she was transferred by ambulance to sparrow hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. by the afternoon, her lungs were clear, her heart strong and we were all relieved that she was doing so much better. alexia's mother, marciela, says that alexia is "deaf," but accurate records of her previous hearing tests are not complte. we are hoping that alexia is discharged soon. dr. jill elfenbein from msu has agreed to do a complete hearing evaluation so the true meaure of her hearing can be obtained. the good news, as can be seen in our pictures, is that jose has been discharged from ingham regional medical center. we are happy to report that he is "just fine." he is lively, active and busy. moisies had his post-op visit with dr. rick smith today, too. he can begin to remove the bandages. dr. gabe is very helpful to each of the patients.thursday lavonna and dr. gabe will be at msu to visit a graduate class, and to participate in some planning meetings for reserach that is being done by msu faculty in the nicte ha clinic. of course, everyone will go to the picu at sparrow to visit alexia!

angelnotions club for women expecting babies





every tuesday and thursday we attend to 5 young ladies who are expecting their first child. our program includes medical attention to assure healthy babies, group talks about birthing techniques, special attention for each expected mother. each expecting mother receives a celebration of a baby shower in the clinc before they give birth. we have two new  healthy babies from the results of this new program. the comments we are getting is that in the other centers is the doctors arent giving them the attention that they need or desire. one of the expecting mothers even said , her doctor hasnt ever looked her in the eye.. ever. in our clinic we feel its important to show love and good attention that they deserve and the results will be proven in the child that they bare.
