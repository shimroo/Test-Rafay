news














the value of experience
at reco, we are engineers, manufacturers, project managers, and team players. we provide retaining walls and other geotechnical structures for heavy civil engineering projects throughout the entire u.s.
2021 marked our 50th anniversary in the united states. we began in 1971 by working with caltrans on a massive landslide repair in the angeles national forest, using a newly patented retaining wall system called reinforced earth®. since then, our engineers have led the industry in researching and advancing the mse technology, while building on our array of retaining wall types and other solutions.
tens of thousands of examples of our work are spread throughout every state. we have the experience and expertise to tackle any job, from a small arch bridge to a design-build project with 2 million square feet of retaining walls.
reach out to us to get your project started on the right path.
