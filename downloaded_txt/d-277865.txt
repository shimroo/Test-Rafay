lies.

public housing smoking ban
(posted may 19, 2018 / updated july 23, 2018)
 
maybe you've found c.l.a.s.h. because you are
a person who lives in any of the public housing complexes across the country
and have received notice that you will be forced outside of your private
apartment because the u.s. dept. of housing has dictated that smoking (cigarettes,
cigars, hookahs, electronic cigarettes) will be banned inside your home
effective july 31, 2018 (or sooner at the will of each local public housing
authority).  so in your anger and frustration you have searched for
help and discovered c.l.a.s.h.
whether you are a directly affected resident or someone
who simply, and rightfully, finds this intrusion into private homes by
a federal agency to be one of the most egregious assaults on and threat
to everyone's fundamental right to privacy to engage in a legal activity
within the confines of one's own home, know that c.l.a.s.h. is fully aware
of the situation and has been since c.l.a.s.h. objected to it when hud
first proposed it at the end of 2015.
c.l.a.s.h. agrees that hud's rule is fraught with serious
constitutional questions.  to quote the editorial board of the ny
observer who wrote
at the time: "it may be the most far-reaching, intrusive and over-reaching
executive order of the entire obama administration."
that is why c.l.a.s.h. has filed a lawsuit
challenging this rule. 
c.l.a.s.h. receives no funding from any industry. 
it survives on the kindness of private citizens who donate their nickels
and dimes.  it's barely enough to cover the cost of maintaining this
web site.  to find out more about the details of this lawsuit and
to please help us help you by contributing to the legal fund (every dollar
counts!) visit our privacy
in the home legal fund page... and then share it far and wide.
today it's smoking in public housing apartments. 
tomorrow it's a state law in apartments in privately owned buildings and
homes.  the day after that it's no beer drinking (creates rowdy drunken
behavior), no peanuts (the dust will attack allergic children in the next
apartment) and anything else government wants to conquer next after slaying
their demon du jour.  this is not about smoking or whether or not
you like it.  this is about keeping the idea that anything traditionally
legally used in the home can be banned from taking root.
thank you!

"i'm
not calling" cards 
tell 'em if you can't smoke, you
can't stay
we don't think anyone should
reward the law by eating or drinking out where you can't smoke (again,
see our boycott
campaign). 

but you might find yourself
in a situation where you have no choice but to enter a smoke-banned place
due to business or social commitments you just can't get out of.  

if that's the case you can
let them know, by leaving them a "i'm not calling" card, that you found
the experience unpleasant, unacceptable, and that you beat it out of there
as fast as you could:  
 
 







i'm
sorry, i'd love to stay for more drinks, 
but
not if i can't smoke. 
the
law has taken away free choice -- 
yours
and mine. 
this
is how i choose to protest it. 
help
can the ban! 
www.nycclash.com
/ info@nycclash.com



even if you've been able to
avoid these places completely you can stop in for a second for the sole
purpose of leaving this card. 

its purpose is to let bar
and restaurant owners know that a large segment of their customers remain
unhappy because of the law, not them.  it's a reminder that it's not
something we're getting used to and that loss in revenues won't blow over
if they just wait it out -- prompting them to remain or get involved in
efforts to "can the ban."  

if you'd like to receive
these cards to hand out, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to:

to submit membership form.
if
you have trouble with our membership form, simply email
us and provide your name, city, state and email address
we do not share your
private information with third parties.
nyc c.l.a.s.h. is a grassroots organization.
there are no membership fees.   donations are gratefully
accepted.
as a member you will be alerted to smoking-related news and activities
in new york and elsewhere. suggestions will be included as to how you may
assist in trying to defeat these anti-smoking campaigns.

becoming a member simply adds your name to the growing number of individuals
who are tired of being treated as second-class citizens and who are willing
to speak out against excessive restrictions. individually we are not being
heard.  acting as a group will force those in office to take our concerns
into consideration just as the anti-smoking groups have had their concerns
addressed to our detriment in the past. silence is interpreted as agreement
and the willingness to bend.  i think we have bent far enough. 
it's time to have our voices heard loud and clear. that endeavor is best
accomplished as a group that stands together.

we invite nonsmokers to participate also.  it is not only about
the imposition of will on smokers but what that may (and has already begun
to) lead to....  those who believe they are more morally correct in
their views forcing others to behave by their standards in all areas
of life choices. do you like your beer?  your steak?  your suv? 
wearing perfume or cologne?  be forewarned that the nannies have you
in their sights already.  if you believe in freedom of choice then
it is in your interest to assist in alleviating the pressure being applied
to smoking so that an activity you enjoy will not be so easily targeted
next.

twenty-five percent of the nation smokes, seventy-three
percent are nonsmokers (those who are willing to compromise or do not care
that others smoke around them) and the other two percent are the self-righteous,
morally imposing anti-smoking zealots.   ninety-eight percent
of the population are in agreement that in all areas of life-style choices,
everyone should be accommodated and should enjoy the right to be left alone.
 
freedom is not a
matter of popularity.  the true measure of our society is how we protect
the freedoms of the minority.
