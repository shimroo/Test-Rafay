art thrives when artists do.

















25 years of mccoll center








































twenty-five years ago, the dream of creating an urban artist's colony in a fire-ravaged church in uptown charlotte became a reality. today, as a hub for creativity and a catalyst for growth, mccoll center is dedicated to putting artists first, supporting them throughout their careers with subsidized studios, access to modern equipment and tools, entrepreneurship programs, and 5,000 square feet of gallery space to exhibit and sell their work. since 1999, our artist residency program has provided a haven for artists—a space where they have the time, resources, and freedom to turn their dreams into reality.
join us in celebrating our rich history and the incredible artists who have shaped our community. throughout the year, we’ll share inspiring stories and opportunities to engage with our community at upcoming celebratory events. learn more.
