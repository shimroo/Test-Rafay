a look into my mind















 











i'm putting together this little site to kill three birds with one stone:

 to learn html
 to post pictures i've taken
 to post information about the branchville vol. fire company on the web





currently the great passion in my life (other than my lovely wife) is 
r/c warship combat.  if you ever dreamed of taking model ships out on the water and blasting them, this is the game 
for you.  go here for more.




as i was building my world war i 
german battlecruiser hindenburg i found that information about the ships of the imperial german navy in wwi was hard 
to come by.  come see what i've found.




here is the un-official home of the branchville volunteer fire company and rescue squad, located in college park, 
maryland. you will be leaving this web page and going to another site.  to return you will need to use the "back" button or 
re-enter this page's url.
