				live dvd/cd recordings

					what's happening now
				

					uncle bonsai continues work on the upcoming release, "the family feast: the study of the human condition, first world problems, and the lasting physiological and psychological effects of eating our young,"  as hilary field celebrates the release of"premieres," her new classical guitar cd featuring previously unrecorded pieces, many of which were composed just for hliary. singer/songwriter scott katz is in the studio working on his upcoming solo recording while electric bonsai band (it's not electric, it's not a band) is working on a new solo collection, featuring favorite studio recordings from his first three releases, along with five newer selections.
				

					what's different
				

					uncle bonsai is putting together the rewards list for the upcoming kickstarter campaign, "get us to carnegie hall!" that's right, the group has practiced, practiced, practiced, for 33 years and is ready to make a play for the big stage. rewards will include buttons ("i helped bring uncle bonsai to carnegie hall"), tickets (of course), round-trip flights to nyc (continental us), nyc hotel rooms (walking distance to the concert), backstage gathering (probably wine & cheese), and even a chance to sing a song on the carnegie hall stage (don't upstage the group, please). for the latest details, visit practice-practice-practice.com or getustocarnegiehall.com!
