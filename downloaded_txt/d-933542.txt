   “ but again… this winter when your favorite groomed trail roughens. your stock suspension’s ride quality and comfort will diminish greatly.  riders on stock suspension will eventually tire, sit down and ultimately drop speed and finish up at a frustratingly slower pace.  we’ve worked hard to match our suspensions deliverables to the all-too-common bump types found on popular and formerly groomed trails. in those same conditions, our owners will ride on enjoying their king-air’s comfort & control! ”
