frequently asked questions
responsedo we have a track record of treatment success?yes. please see the peer reviewed case study series orthomolecular treatment response published in the journal of orthomolecular medicine in 2010. our clinic protocol continues to evolve on various levels and patient response has improved proportionately.
what is a positive responder?a positive responder is a patient whose energy starts to lift and whose symptoms dissipate in layers. positive responders have symptoms that can improve quickly or incrementally, it all depends how ingrained your specific biochemical profile is and how compliant you are.
why is response faster for some, slower for others?some cases can take months to resolve while others weeks. if you are constipated with a significant heavy metal load, have a significant biochemical imbalance, sensitivities (to supplements, drugs, environment/food allergens) or a poor diet, we have to address these issues before heading in a more direct treatment direction.

treatment approachhow do you assess mental health status?we assess mental health by getting a solid patient history and getting the patient to do a hoffer osmond diagnostic (hod) test, a specific monitoring questionnaire for overall mental health. the hod test is not diagnostic but it nicely assesses mood, thinking, and sensory perception- the three primary components of behavior.
what is the advantage of ‘lab-based targeted nutritional treatment’?everyone has a unique biological pattern and the right lab tests can help us greatly in determining how best to ‘target’ the nutritional treatment. appropriate lab testing provides a roadmap to follow along a meaningful and specific treatment route.
what makes our lab-based treatment approach different?targeted blood testing and unwashed hair mineral and hair metal analysis remain the cornerstone of our treatment. this approach encompasses over 100 fundamental metabolic trends.
what metabolic trends are the most important to assess?the trends that are the most important include mineral imbalance, zinc-b6-manganese deficiency (pyroluria), niacin deficiency, heavy metal toxicity (copper, mercury, lead), inadequate food intake, food intolerances, poor cell function (fast/slow, mitochondrial function), sugar imbalance, iron imbalance, inflammation, & thyroid-adrenal imbalance.
what protocols do we use?our protocol focuses on the normalization of various lab trends and we assess results with a clinic specific optimal reference range view. we have a toolbox of new and advanced treatment options for copper 2+ toxicity, copper 1+ deficiency, zinc deficiency, heavy metal toxicity, niacin dependency and food intolerances.
why do you focus on using core primary nutrients?in our experience, core minerals and vitamins given at the right dose are essential and can normalize multiple layers of imbalance simultaneously and safely. zinc for example, is a component of over 200 metabolic pathways involved in healthy brain, heart, and digestive tract function.

conditions treateddo you treat both mental & general health?yes, we treat both. early on, the clinic developed a robust lab-based treatment that was successful in alleviating not only severe mental illness symptoms (schizophrenia, mood, and behavior disorder) but also general health symptoms.
what range of conditions do you treat?we treat fatigue (#1 chief complaint), mental health (depression, anxiety, bipolar, adhd, schizophrenia, ptsd), insomnia, digestive problems, thyroid imbalances, allergies, weight problems, longevity, female/male/kid’s health issues, poor academic or work performance, concussion syndrome and more.

treatment safetyare side effects possible?if there are side effects, typically they include nausea or diarrhea which are often corrected by dosing supplements with meals or cutting back on specific supplements. other side effects can occur transiently during treatment, for example, when zinc ‘liberates’ heavy metals and your body ready for that.

medication considerationscan i come off psychiatric medication?coming off of some psychiatric medications risks severe discontinuation side effects and some people may or may not do well when medication doses are lowered.  if your aim is to maintain ‘lower effective doses’ of psychiatric medication, you need to work closely with your prescribing md.
can i take md prescribed medications or drugs during treatment?some nutritional protocols are not provided when you are on certain medications or drugs.  nutritional protocols can help keep medication side effects at bay.  caution is upheld when the nutritional mechanism of action or elimination crosses over with that of the drug.  your md is responsible for prescribing your medication regimen safely.

consulting with usdo you do video consults?yes. post-covid, many naturopathic doctors adhere to various hybrid protocol formats. the hybrid format of our clinic involves video consulting with an in-person physical exam component provided as deemed necessary. in our experience, patients tend to be more engaged and relaxed during video consults.
how do i book a consult?it’s simple.  just call the clinic directly at 905-491-6930 or use our book appointment tool and we will contact you directly.
who is the clinic care provider?dr ray pataracchia nd is the clinic care provider, a naturopathic doctor in clinical practice since 2001. he collaborated extensively with the primary founding father of orthomolecular medicine (dr abram hoffer md; now deceased, 2009), coauthored the book minerals in health & disease, and has authored several peer reviewed journal articles.

costwhat does treatment cost?consult, lab, and supplement costs are outlined in detail on our one-page clinic services consent form that all patients print, read and sign in advance of the first visit.  please call the clinic at 905-491-6930 if you have specific questions on costs.
will my health insurance cover costs?costs for private health care are not covered by ohip.  however, if you have extended health care coverage, a portion of consult costs may be covered.  lab and supplement costs are typically not covered but your place of work may have a health spending fund that can be used for that.

clinic catchment areadoes the clinic treat patients who live outside ontario or internationally?unfortunately, to be considered a client, you have to be an ontario resident living in ontario at the time of treatment. if you live abroad or out-of-province and are looking for a provider, here are some helpful links: classic orthomolecular directory, psychiatry redefined, and orthomolecular.org practitioner directory.
