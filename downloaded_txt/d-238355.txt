most complex areas of law, requiring extensive experience and expertise. lawyers must carefully review all aspects of the stateâs case, from the basis for the stop, the officerâs decision to require the driver to exit the car to perform standardized field sobriety tests, the administration and interpretation of standardized field sobriety tests, the advice of penalties for failing or refusing a chemical breath or blood test, and the administration of the test itself. many drivers have medical conditions that may mimic some of the signs and symptoms of impaired driving. it is possible to produce medical records showing that even before the arrest that the defendant suffered from a condition that the officer may have mistaken as indicating impairment.before the initial consultation with a maryland dui lawyer, clients may be sent extensive questionnaires to enable to lawyer to properly assess the case. at the consultation, the lawyer will review the events in detail, to determine the likely defenses at the mva and in court. it is important to act quickly after an arrest, because if the driver wishes to contest a proposed suspension by the maryland motor vehicle administration for failing or refusing a breath test, a hearing request must be mailed with the required $150 fee, within 30 days from the arrest.it is unusual to see a drunk driving case where there is not some defense available to beat or reduce the charges. in most dui cases, prosecutors offer plea deals that are no better than what would happen after losing a trial. so there is usually little downside to fighting the dui/dwi case in court and at the mva.goldstein & stamm, p.a. represents individuals charged with traffic offenses including: dui/ dwi /drunk driving, motor vehicle

was fine, can the officer pull me over? he did pull you over! the officer needs an articulable reasonable suspicion to believe you committed, were committing, or were about to commit, a crime. if the judge finds the officer did not have a basis to make the stop, that may be a defense in court. it is not a defense at motor vehicle administration (mva) hearings unless it can be shown that... what should i say if i'm stopped by a police officer and he asks me if i've been drinking? you are not required to answer potentially incriminating questions. a polite "i would like to speak with an attorney before i answer any questions" is a good reply.view more maryland dui lawyer blog view more video library free consultation with maryland dui lawyerwhy most maryland duis should go to trialwe
