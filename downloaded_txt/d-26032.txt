custom piecesthe original floorcloth



hand painted floorcloths are made of simple materials: canvas, paints and sealants crafted into a colorful floor mat.painted canvas can be custom designed in any size, color or design. painted floorcloths hold up to substantial use. many of my early paintings are still serviceable after 30 years on the floor.

kind words from customers



“beauties… love, love, love them.”



“perfect… prettier than i ever imagined.”



“i just love them, they’re very durable and comfortable to stand on.”



“i purchased one of your original floor mats in 2001 at a craft fair.  i still have it in my kitchen and it looks as good as the day i purchased it.  it still brings me joy!”


























what are floorcloths?



floorcloths are paintings crafted into rugs ... a good marriage of art and craft. kathy cooper floorcloths depict whimsical graphic images in rich, wonderful colors.floorcloths are one of the earliest forms of floorcoverings, attaining great popularity in england in the 1700's. they were first imported by americans during the early years of our history and eventually manufactured here. interest in floorcloths declined with the development of linoleum around the turn of the century.














“my images come from my personal experiences, the garden, my kids and all of the visual stimulation around me. i enjoy the response of my customers when they are inspired by the colors, when they respond to the energy color gives.”— kathy
