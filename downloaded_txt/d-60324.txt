fx850 strapped twin disc clutch kit
the fx850 strapped has been developed out of necessity to bridge the gap between a single disc clutch that is easy to drive on the street and our original fx850 twin disc. while our original 850 twin disc is streatable, it was never designed with extended street use in mind. that is where the 850 strapped is different. utilizing drive straps to isolate the pressure plate and the mid-plate between the two discs, we are able to virtually eliminate all chatter and allow for a much smoother engagement.
