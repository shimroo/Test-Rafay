read quotes






savor the premier santana tribute band
savor was formed to honor the more than 50-year career of latin-rock legend carlos santana — from the raw power of the self-titled album issued in 1969 to the recent spate of hits with current stars that makes santana’s music so well-loved.
with a team of consummate musicians, the band churns out hits like oye como va, black magic woman, evil ways, europa, samba pa ti, and more. their rendition is so true, you’ll close your eyes and think you’re listening to your favorite santana album. don’t miss this band!
