lower makefield township's bird town - bird of the month
the bald eagle fascinating facts about the bald eagle
● rather than do their own fishing, bald eagles often go after other creatures’ catches. a bald eagle will harass a hunting osprey until the smaller raptor drops its prey in midair, where the eagle swoops it up.● bald eagles have been known to play with plastic bottles and other objects pressed into service as toys. one observer witnessed six bald eagles passing sticks to each other in midair.● the largest bald eagle nest on record, in st. petersburg, florida, was 2.9 meters in diameter and 6.1 meters tall.● immature bald eagles spend the first four years of their lives in nomadic exploration of vast territories and can fly hundreds of miles per day.● bald eagles can live a long time. the oldest recorded bird in the wild was at least 38 years old when it was hit and killed by a car in new york in 2015. it had been banded in the same state in 1977.● bald eagles occasionally hunt cooperatively, with one individual flushing prey towards another
