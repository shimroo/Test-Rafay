systematic roadmap...




  
sr offers a systematic trajectory of learning structure for students to capitalize their creativity with engineering disciplines. it aims to increase their propensity for the transition to competitive colleges, especially in engineering fields.







staff - creative thinkers with engineering disciplines



 
common traits:
                  
 robotics and/or computer science enthusiasts.
 engaged in robotics throughout the school year, not seasonal.
 possess levels of experience and competency in the subject matter 
                      uncommon in grade-school levels institutions.









grouped by true skill levels, not age/grade




  

students are grouped by their skills level, not age
no one is confined in the same level even within the same term.  each is given ample of opportunity to advance at their own pace. 








focus on computational thinking, not just rote skills.




 

our programs draw on mathematical thinking, analysis, and creativity, not just rote skills.
focus on how efficiently problems with algorithmic thinking, and computational models.
