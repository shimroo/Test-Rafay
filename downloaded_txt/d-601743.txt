meet the founder















hi, i’m lissette!



consider me a theater-kid-turned-digital-marketer. i’ve paired my 4+ years of social media management and 8+ years of performing arts into a personable and effective approach to social media marketing.to create a well-crafted social media presence, it's vital to dream big, execute resourcefully and continually expand perspective. you’re here to tell your story. i’m here to make sure that story is seen and heard.a great business owner knows how to ✴ delegate ✴ my goal for every client is to show them how valuable social media can be when they delegate their tasks with a team like studio 1304.

my approach



it all begins with dreaming. and i mean dreaming without limits. as cliche as that sounds, it’s the first step towards creating realistic goals. big dreams are supported by great actionable plans. my greatest joy when working with clients is synthesizing their ideas, building a strategy and executing so they get the success they were imagining. as the mother of black hollywood, jennifer lewis, puts it, “the elevator to success is broken! take the stairs!” my approach is about taking those steps together.



the studio 1304 process…




step #1 dream itat this phase, you are the dreamer and i am the architect. you share your vision board (or we build one together!) and i start drawing up our future!




step #2 draft ithere’s where we come up with a plan for how studio 1304 will be executing. whether it be content creation, strategy, ads or all of the above, we’ve got the ground plan for your vision for your project.




step #3 publish itexecute! execute! execute! by this time in our process, we have declared ourselves as the do-ers and have begun putting our plans into action.




step #4 rinse & repeatsocial media is constantly changing, and as should we! when we honor that we are consistently developing a research-based strategy tailored to your brand, the goals and accomplishments continue to grow!
