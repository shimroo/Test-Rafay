accomplished trader, mathematician, programmer & author
    with over 44 yearsâ experience in investing and trading
sunny j. harris has been trading since 1981. she is a computer programmer and mathematician, having used tradestation since the early systemwriterâ¢ and superchartsâ¢ days in the 1980s. besides tradestation, sunny has also used metastock, genesis navigator, ninjatrader, tc2000, vantagepoint and multicharts (and more) in her own trading.
she published a monthly magazine called traders catalog & resource guide™ (tc&rg™) for 8 years, beginning in 1993, and was rated #1 trader in the under $10 million category by stark research two years running, achieving a 365%  and 178% profit in two consecutive years. sunny continues to trade real-time along with consulting and programming for clients and students.
sunnyâs first book, trading 101 â how to trade like a pro (released in july 1996) sold out within the first two weeks and continues to be a financial best-seller. her second book, trading 102 â getting down to business, was released in october 1998 and also has achieved record sales. she subsequently wrote electronic day trading 101 and getting started in trading in 2000 and 2001 respectively. in 2011 she released tradestation made easy! which still proves to be the number one resource for tradestationâ® and easylanguageâ® and applies equally to multichartsâ® and its powerlanguageâ®. sunny and samuel tennis completed their opus: "the definitive guide to tradestation's easylanguage & ooel programming" in august 2023.
