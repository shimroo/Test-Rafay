frequently asked questions about ordering custom signs and personalized banners online

"why does a small business need custom signs or personalized banners?"
custom signs help all businesses and organizations survive and prosper.  custom printed signs and even personalized banners, are one of the single most important reasons businesses succeed.  with the right type of custom signage, your business will reach its full economic potential.
custom signage and personalized banners help create thousands of marketing impressions on a daily basis.  these impressions attract potential clients to your business or organization.  working silently 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, custom signs work to advertise and promote your business. 
create a change from the normal buying habits of your target audience by using custom signs.  custom signage helps develop memory for your location and creates branding for the services and products you offer.  with custom signs you will instill confidence in your consumers and assist them in remembering your business or organization when in need of the products or services you offer.

"what is a corporate look for custom signage?"
a corporate look in most cases begins with your custom signs.  custom signs can promote a consistent image, allowing you to "brand" your business.  this brand creates an image that consumers will recognize and can relate to.  this branding or corporate look helps create an entity that will represent your business, and portray the beliefs and values your business stands for.
your corporate image allows customers to get a perception of what your company is about and what it stands for.  custom signs strongly influence what your consumers think about you and your business.  you can attempt to tell them what you what them to know about your business, but nothing does that better than custom signage.
your custom signs and even your logo are the main visual cues that help consumers form an impression of your business.  much more than a trademark, these images are your sole non-verbal avenue to communicate with potential consumers.  if your message isn't communicate effectively or done poorly odds are these consumers will not patronize your business.  however, if your custom signage is strong, confident and gives a good impression of your business, you are much more likely to win a loyal customer.  one of the easiest and most effective ways to secure faithful consumers is to implement custom signage, either on the interior or exterior of your business.  in most cases both locations are ideal for effective business branding.

"do custom signs have to have a logo in order to have a corporate look?"
while there are no concrete rules when it comes to the creation and design of your custom signage, corporate signage traditionally does include a logo of some sort.  it may be your business name that forms the logo, like kodak.  everyone recognizes the look of that name and we quickly identify with their products.
custom signs, that attract consumers, usually include that very important step of creating a logo.  a logo that reflects your business, your products and what you stand for are important factors to consider in the creation of your logo.  choose your fonts, colors, images and graphics with care; you may be tied to them for a long period of time.  it's beneficial, in your logo and business image, to project your purpose, your values, your strengths and any unique features of your business or organization.

how can small businesses use custom signage with a corporate look to create "brand" awareness?
custom signs help brand a location just as labels help to brand products in a grocery store.  with the use of custom signs, logos and graphics, a business can repeatedly reinforce their business image.  this reinforcement creates the very important "top-of-the-mind" awareness with your consumers within your business community.
incorporating a consistent business image to display on custom signs, personalized banners, business cards and other promotional items will help to grow and continue to brand your business, particularly its location.  this will help to create even greater consumer awareness and recall when the products and services of your business are needed.
two specific examples that prove this fact would be coca cola and starbucks.  branding worked for these companies because they incorporated the same logo, design and text into everything they did.  they created their corporate image.  this allowed individuals to recognize their brands immediately when they see their custom signs.  and because the image is familiar it established a certain comfort level in the product and services provided.

"what exactly are custom signs?"
custom signs reference an extremely effective and versatile range of made-to-order promotional and advertising products.  all types of business signs, custom signage, hanging signs, street signs, fence signs, personalized banners, engraved signs are just a few we offer.  all of these custom signs can be crafted to match your exact business or organization specifications, and all of which are cost effective.  we proudly ship custom signs and personalized banners from our facility right here in historic charleston, south carolina.

"can a small business afford custom signage in today's economy?"
cutting corners and saving a few dollars is a common concern in today's economy.  some businesses feel cutting custom signs from their budget is an expense they can afford.  however, did you know that custom signage is the least expensive form of advertising compared to other advertising media?  this wholes true for small business as well as larger ones.
custom signage and personalized banners are your silent salesman, marketing and advertising your message to your target audience.  these silent salesman work for you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  unlike custom signs, with other forms of advertising you acquire month to month financial obligations, all without actually owning anything.  in addition, you have no assurance that your advertising message is reaching your potential consumers.
below are some statistics provided by the small business association.  

on average, one additional on-premise sign resulted in an increase in annual sales revenues of 4.75%. this translates to a $23,750 increase in average sales revenues for a typical store in the study group with annual sales of $500,000.
on average, one additional on-premise sign increased the annual number of transactions by 3.93%. this translates into more than 3,900 additional transactions for a store with an annual average of 100,000 transactions.
on average, one additional 36-square-foot wall sign added $0.06 per transaction, while one additional 144-square-foot pole sign added $0.78 per transaction.    

from a business owner's perspective, a custom business sign is a capital investment. when you factor in your return on investment, custom signs are not expensive at all. in fact, the signs routinely pay for themselves many times over.

"do i have to use a specific type of custom signage to get a corporate look?"
most certainly not! we offer one of the largest varieties of materials to choose from when it comes to custom signs. first decide on the location of your custom signs or personalized banners and how you want to mount them, and then you can accurately choose your custom signage material.  by using the same look on all your advertising campaigns, you can portray the image of a large corporate company.  this will add to your success as a business as well as instilling confidence in your clientele.

"what are the most popular types of custom signage?"
3-d letters
3-d letters or dimensional letters are available in an assortment of shapes, colors, letter styles as well as sizes.  they are suitable for both interior and exterior applications.  most businesses prefer the look of the individually mounted and 3-d molded letters over a flat panel sign.  these "sign letters" are commonly seen in lobby signage, showroom custom signs and other corporate settings.

wooden letters ‚Äî are great for a nostalgic appearance.  but because plastic letters have extended durability and a lower price point, wooden letters aren't as popular as they use to be.
molded plastic letters are extremely versatile and are available up to 2" in thickness.  in addition, we carry flat, solid plastic letters in various fonts, sizes and colors.  these letters are available from 1/8" to 1/2".  
metal logos and custom metal letters are readily available in a variety of finishes.  raised aluminum letters, stainless steel letter and bronze metal letters are just a few of the options we offer.  metal dimensional signage is your best selection when you want the highest quality appearance for you custom signage.
super smooth gator foam letters are your best option for light weight dimensional signage, at an affordable price point.
hybrid letters which includes metal plated foam letters, create rich, sophisticated interior wall signs at a much lower price point than solid metal letters.
lighted channel letters are your best selection when your require visibility 24 hours a day.

installing all your custom dimensional letters and letter signs is quick and easy since we supply all the mounting installation templates and hardware.  simply tape your installation template to your mounting surface, making sure it is level and straight.  with this template, the placement of your dimensional letters is pre laid out making installation something you can do yourself.  this very same installation method is the same procedure professional sign installers use.
real estate signs
regardless if the real estate market is at a high or declining slightly, custom real estate signs will continue to be a pivotal asset in marketing and advertising your realtor properties.  when it comes to real estate signs and even yard signs, the popular choices are still coroplast and aluminum.
these two options are ideal for either end of the market‚Ä¶
for a low cost, less permanent real estate sign choice, many choose coroplast.  for a premium and more professional look, many realtors choose aluminum real estate signs.  regardless of your real estate sign choice, we offer a variety of products and accessories to assist in displaying and mounting your real estate signs.  real estate frames, wire stakes and vinyl hanging post are just a few of the many accessories we have readily available to complement your real estate signs.
when in need of a sturdier, larger and more visible real estate sign, we suggest our more durable sign materials like dura-wood or armour-wood.  these large and bold signs are ideal for commercial property, outdoor site signs or construction signs.  signs crafted from this material are resilient to the elements and will help keep your property looking fresh and new.
personalized banners
personalize banners now have the ability to display and project a professional corporate image, making them extremely popular for all types of businesses or organizations.  personalized banners are available in any size and are an economical method to display your business message effectively.
personalized banners aren't exclusively for business advertising either!  church banners, school banners, changeable banners, hanging banners and personalized banners for non-profit agencies are just a few alternative uses for banners.
your personalized banners are digitally printed from your approved designs.  once you give us the final approval on your design, we begin production of your personalized banner.  when completed, most personalized banners are hemmed with grommets (other options available) and then are securely shipped to you in a crush proof shipping cylinder. 
(we recommend keeping the tube to store your new banner sign, with the image rolled to the outside to prevent the ink from sticking while in storage.)
in case you need a double sided banner, for example like a street banner, fear not we have those available as well.  in addition we have a large selection of banner accessories to successfully install and display your personalized banners.
trade show banners are another one of our specialties.  with the right imagery and effective messaging, personalized banners are a sure way to attract attention at trade shows.  combined with any of our retractable banner stands, personalized banners will make you the hit of the show.
aluminum signs
aluminum continues to be one of the most popular selections when it comes to custom signs.  aluminum signs are professional looking and are available in a wide range of thicknesses, as well as shape, color or size.  if your business requires a large, rigid, seamless sign panel, we even carry aluminum up to 6' tall by 12' wide.
aluminum metal signs are light weight while remaining rigid, making it the perfect sign material for indoor and outdoor applications.  regardless if you are in need of a small aluminum sign for interior use or a larger sized sign for exterior advertising, aluminum signs are a wise business choice.
aluminum signs are manufactured from anodized aluminum making it rust-proof, a characteristic that is often specified by government agencies since aluminum signs weather well in salt-water and marine applications.
if your business or location requires a thicker, stronger sign material, we suggest our outdoor grade dibond, alumalite, armour-wood  or super smooth dura-wood.  all of which are worthy options to consider for both wall mounted building signage and outdoor signage by the road.
acrylic signs
acrylic plastic signs are an elegant, sleek, contemporary sign that has become very popular with our clients.  these custom signs command attention, with their flamed polished edges, high-end appearance and versatility.  acrylic plastic custom signs look almost identical to heavy glass making it another reason they are so popular with large and small businesses.
acrylic signs, unlike glass, can be cut to any shape and size to match or create any look your business or organization requires.  acrylic signs, mostly used inside, are a popular choice for a corporate, successful and professional business image.
working with a custom online sign company had many advantages.  one being we can precision cut acrylic with our laser.  in addition, this laser can etch your message or business logos onto the acrylic, either front or back.
other popular types of plastic signs include pvc signs, coroplast signs, replacement sign faces and many more!

"how do i choose effective custom signs for my company?"
when choosing the most effective custom signs for your business first determine the exact purpose of your custom signs. for example:

will your custom signs be used to direct traffic flow or as an informational sign or more importantly to advertise your business?
will your custom signs be permanent or temporary?
