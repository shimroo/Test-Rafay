alaska fisheries management and marine life protection
learn about noaa fisheries' work in the gulf of alaska, bering sea, aleutian islands, chukchi sea, and beaufort sea.

alaska's dynamic, often ice-covered seas are home to a remarkable diversity of life—crustaceans, fish, seals, sea lions, porpoises, whales, and more. few places in the world offer such beauty and bounty. this region of nearly 1.5 million square miles includes waters in the gulf of alaska, bering sea, aleutian islands, chukchi sea, and beaufort sea.
alaska produces more than half the fish caught in waters off the coast of the united states, with an average wholesale value of nearly $4.5 billion a year. alaska's fisheries are among the best-managed, most sustainable in the world. alaska resources provide jobs and a stable food supply for the nation, while supporting a traditional way of life for alaska native and local fishing communities.
together, noaa fisheries alaska regional office and alaska fisheries science center help ensure the sustainability of these marine resources for generations.

alaska fisheries science center


alaska marine life and ecosystem science
the alaska fisheries science center supports the sustainable management and conservation of marine life. find scientific reports and research program information.

our high quality research supports sustainable management and conservation of alaska marine species with economic and cultural benefits for the nation. alaska waters support some of the most important commercial fisheries in the world. large and diverse populations of whales, seals, sea lions, and porpoises and alaska native hunting and fishing communities also share these waters.we study the health and size of marine animal populations. we also study the key areas where these animals feed, breed, and grow. to study ocean habitats, we monitor environmental conditions important to sustain marine life. for instance, we regularly monitor sea surface temperatures in the bering sea, aleutian islands and gulf of alaska. we analyze biological, oceanographic and ecological data collected during research surveys and by trained fisheries observers in our laboratories. from this, we learn more about marine animal diets, age, growth and reproduction, food web dynamics and the role of humans in marine ecosystems. we use this and other information to monitor changes to marine animal populations and alaska ecosystems over time.

sustainable fisheries


alaska commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing resources
find permits, reporting forms, rules, and regulations for alaska's commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries.

the alaska regional office works with the alaska fisheries science center and the north pacific fishery management council to manage alaska’s sustainable fisheries. using the best available science, we work through the council process authorized under the magnuson-stevens fishery conservation and management act to develop measures for best management of alaska’s fisheries, considering a range of factors such as the health of the fish stocks and economic impact of fishery practices. once fishing levels and regulations are adopted and approved, the alaska regional office works to implement the council decisions. the goal is to allow fishermen to harvest the optimum amount of fish while leaving enough in the ocean to reproduce and provide future fishing opportunities in perpetuity.

protected marine life overview


alaska marine life conservation and recovery resources
we protect, conserve, and manage alaska's protected marine mammals, fish, invertebrates, and sea turtles. find information on our protected species programs.

the protected resources division works to conserve and recover marine mammals in close coordination with the state of alaska and other partners. to manage protected marine species, as required under the marine mammal protection act, endangered species act, and fur seal act, the alaska region advances recovery of threatened and endangered species and the conservation of marine mammals, including whales, seals, and sea lions. we work to minimize interactions between marine mammals and commercial fisheries; promote responsible marine mammal viewing practices; coordinate response to stranded or entangled marine mammals; consult with federal agencies to minimize project effects on threatened and endangered species; and cooperatively manage subsistence use of marine mammals through co-management agreements with alaska native organizations.

alaska habitat conservation and restoration resources
we conserve alaska's habitats to boost fish populations, recover threatened and endangered species, and support communities. find information on our programs.

noaa fisheries conducts and reviews environmental analyses for a large variety of activities ranging from commercial fishing, to coastal development, to large transportation and energy projects. working with industries, stakeholder groups, government agencies, and private citizens, we ensure that these activities have minimal impact on essential fish habitat and marine life in alaska. our habitat conservation activities include protecting essential fish habitat, mitigating damage to and enhancing habitat affected by hydropower project construction and operations, removing invasive species, and restoring habitat that has been affected by development, oil spills, and other human activities. we focus on habitats used by federally-managed fish species located offshore, nearshore, in estuaries, and in freshwater areas important to migratory salmon.
