about atv mn
atv mn is the state association representing 70 atv clubs and atv riding families across minnesota. it promotes safe, responsible atv riding, and provides atv clubs with the “tools” they need to build atv trails for the riding public that are fun and sustainable, while protecting natural resources.

the all-terrain vehicle association of minnesota, inc., first organized in 1983, is a non-profit corporation under minnesota statutes chapter 317a. it is comprised of individual, family and business members. the management of the all-terrain vehicle association of minnesota (atv mn) occurs through the state board of directors. the daily direction of atv mn is conducted by the executive board, as delegated and overseen by the state board of directors.

atv mn was established to serve the interests of all-terrain vehicle (atv) owners by advocating for atv recreation, advancing the safe use of atvs, providing information, and participating in legislative and regulatory activities related to the use of atvs.
