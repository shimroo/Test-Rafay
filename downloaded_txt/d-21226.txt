we love our apartment in shadyside, set in a great location right off of walnut street, and a short walk to multiple bus stops. the apartment itself is in good condition, with regular maintenance done and utility repairs are made in a timely manner. the walnut capital team responds in a timely manner to questions, though be sure to ask clarifying questions about setting up utilities when moving in, as most of them are through a third party. rent can be high depending on the area, just fyi.
