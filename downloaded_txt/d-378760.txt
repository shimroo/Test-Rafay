 whippets


whippets are a sighthound of medium sized that originated in england in the 1800âs, likely descending from greyhounds (with terrier thrown into the mix). later, when hunting laws were repealed, whippets also became popular in the sport of dog racing. whippets were first recognized by the english kennel club in 1891 and the american kennel club followed in 1888. 
whippet racing has been present in many varying forms since the mid-nineteenth century. one of the first forms of the sport was ârag racingâ where the handler would hand slip the dog and the dog would run to a partner waving a white rag. later, like greyhounds, whippets ran a mechanical lure. today, whippets run   straight track (in the us through nawra, wra or cwa), oval (notra) or lure course (akc, asfa).  this site contains information regarding oval racing and the records of race meets and title information for those racers.
