about taylor guitars
taylor guitars was founded in 1974 by bob taylor and kurt listug, and has grown into the leading global builder of premium acoustic guitars. renowned for blending modern, innovative manufacturing techniques with a master craftsman's attention to detail, taylor acoustic guitars are widely considered among the best-sounding and easiest to play in the world. the company is a pioneer in the use of computer mills, lasers and other high-tech tools and proprietary machinery, and today, bob taylor is widely recognized throughout the musical instrument industry as the visionary acoustic guitar manufacturer.

today, taylor employs over 1,200 people and produces hundreds of guitars per day exclusively in two factory complexes in the u.s and mexico: el cajon, california, and in tecate, baja california, mexico. (taylor does not manufacture any guitars in asia.) the company maintains an active dealer network, with taylor guitars sold through hundreds of retail locations in north america and with international distribution to 60 countries, including a distribution warehouse and factory service center in the netherlands.our site has a wealth of information about what goes into making a taylor guitar and how to make this very important decision. we have guides for how to find the right fit for you. learn about the subtle differences in shapes and styles. delve into different types of woods and construction, which are vital to the flavor and tone of an acoustic. explore the taylor line by series to find the look and style you want for your instrument.every guitar player needs a great acoustic guitar – or several – in their collection. finding the right acoustic guitar for you can be a daunting process even for the most seasoned player. if you are new to shopping for guitars, then it is even more critical that you learn all you can before you make your first purchase. if your first acoustic guitar is not the appropriate choice for you, then it can dramatically reduce the enjoyment you will get out of your instrument. if you are a new guitar player, the wrong guitar can be downright discouraging. you want a guitar that fits you, is effortless to play, and has the rich, beautiful tone you love to make it the instrument you dream of playing hour after hour.
