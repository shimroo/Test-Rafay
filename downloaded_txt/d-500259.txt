impact and relevance of transit disturbances on planning in intermodal container networks"in north-west europe, the options for intermodal inland transportation of containers are increasing. inland corridors become increasingly interconnected in hinterland networks. to minimize operating costs, new methods are required that allow integral network operations management. the network operations consist of allocating containers to available inland transportation services, i.e. planning. fo..." [more...]impact and relevance of transit disturbances on planning in intermodal container networks. b. van riessen, r.r. negenborn, g. lodewijks, r. dekker. maritime economics & logistics, vol. 17, pp. 440-463,  december  2015.
