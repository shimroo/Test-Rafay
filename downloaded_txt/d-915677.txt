italian sportcars?





i don't speak or read italian, but i do have fun from time to time looking at websites and reviewing them.  sometimes that can be a challenge, as in this case a website selling auto usate milano is designed to sell used cars in milan.  yes, milan as in europe.  there was a time when you'd have to search for a dictionary to translate, or use one of the web translation tools out there.  which means if you saw vendita auto usate you'd at first wonder, then search it out.  in this case vendita means "sale" so it's easy to guess that means "used car sale."  google makes it fairly easy to translate faster than before giving you the ability to translate websites right from the search engine.  this means in a few seconds i can discover that garage del parko was created back in 1978 by antonino aldo and his son took over the business after spending time since he was very young being around cars.  alexander aldo has not only his father's passion for cars but is moving towards using technology like the internet.  apparently even with computers manuela aldo keeps detailed hand written records.  all of this was originally written in italian that without easy translation, i'd only be able to pick a few words out.why is this important?  let's say you have had a life long desire for a particular italian sportscar, knowing how to translate and how to navigate the internet creates more opportunities for you.  that desire to compro auto usate buy a used car is no longer limited to just what is around your area.  of course there are more complications when it comes to picking up your dream car but?  if it's really your dream car then for you it may be worth it.  if nothing else?  you can visit the websites, look at the prices and compare them to what cars cost here, using of course an online translator for euro into dollars...:-)

delphi oracle lecture at toledo museum of art on april 16





this sounds like one i'd like to attend, in via e-mail:delphi oracle lecture at toledo museum of artfree lecture slated april 16 at toledo museum of artthe delphic oracle: modern science examines an ancient mysteryin ancient times, the sacred oracle of delphi was so influential that famous men from alexander the great and roman emperors consulted the shrine in central greece before making decisions. on april 16, a modern archaeologist will offer new insights into the mystery surrounding the oracle during a presentation at the toledo museum of art.john r. hale, director of liberal studies at the university of louisville, will discuss recent research confirming ancient descriptions of the sacred oracle of delphi. his talk, titled the delphic oracle: modern science examines an ancient mystery, will be at 7:30 p.m. friday, april 16, in the museum’s little theater. the free presentation is co-sponsored by the archaeological institute of america-toledo society and the museum. hale is the 2009-2010 norton lecturer for the national archaeological institute.ancient greek and roman authors describe the sacred site at delphi as containing unusual geological features and phenomena: a fissure in the rock, emission of sweet-smelling vapor and a sacred spring. the pythia—the priestess who pronounced the oracles—sat above the fissure where she could inhale the vapor, thus triggering a trance in which she became the medium for the prophecies of the god apollo.most 20th century scholars were skeptical of the ancient traditions. then, in 1995, an interdisciplinary team began studying not only the archaeology of delphi, but also related evidence from geology, chemistry and toxicology research. hale and others on the team were able to validate the ancient sources. the team has gone on to study greek oracle sites elsewhere in the aegean and asia and has found similar geological features.hale has been involved in archaeological fieldwork for more than three decades. in addition to studies of ancient oracle sites in greece and turkey, he has looked under the sea for lost fleets from the time of the persian wars in greek waters. he has a bachelor’s degree from yale university and a doctorate from the university of cambridge in england. his writings have been published in the journal antiquity, the classical bulletin, the journal of roman archaeology and scientific american.after the lecture, copies of the new trade paperback edition of hale’s book lords of the sea: the epic story of the athenian navy and the birth of democracy will be available for purchase and autograph.

some mobile window shopping...





one thing about the internet, you can see what's available in a variety of places outside of the us which can at times make you look for items you see in the uk, as an example, here in the us.  one good example of this is in looking for a blackberry case. three of my daughters have blackberries.  i had heard about invisible shield for phones, but i didn't know that much about the product until i spent some time surfing the mobile fun website.  it also was helpful in letting me know that it's not offered for my particular phone, but it appears to be made for my daughters phones.  i also don't know that much about the whole bluetooth headset accessory for phones, but they seem to have all of them.    i also found the picture references for each phone in the different manufacturer categories helpful.  on more than one occasion i've had to try to find some type of an accessory for one of the girls and not been able to remember exactly what type of phone it was beyond the manufacturer and how it looked. i also didn't realize things like an iphone dock existed.  this means while i can't shop there?  i've still bookmarked it as a resource.  i also noticed that they accept paypal, which is something i wish more online stores did because it does make it much easier to purchase things online that way.  for those of you who are readers from the uk, you may enjoy shopping for "everything mobile in the uk" there, for those of us here in the us?  window shopping is fun, though you might get a little depressed to discover that in the uk? some of the free gift offers with mobile phones include things like a free nintendo wii and wii fit...

ut physicians cardiology lab receives accreditation





on october 8, 2009 the university of toledo physicians, llc, ut heart and vascular center located in perrysburg was granted accreditation by the intersocietal commission for the accreditation of nuclear medicine laboratories (icanl) for its nuclear stress testing lab. the laboratory is one of a growing number of nuclear cardiology laboratories in the united states, canada and puerto rico to be so recognized for its commitment to high quality patient care and its provision of quality diagnostic testing. during a nuclear stress test, both the pump function and the blood flow of the heart are assessed to detect the presence of cardiovascular disease and may also discover important information regarding the occurrence of future heart attacks. this is a vital diagnostic tool considering that one american dies every 32 seconds of cardiovascular disease, disorders of the heart and blood vessels.additionally, the echocardiography laboratory at the ut heart and vascular center in perrysburg also received accreditation on march 24, 2009, and was one of the first one thousand echocardiography laboratories to be recognized. echocardiography is a complex imaging technique that relies on the experience and training of both the physician and the sonographer. their interpretive and technical abilities determine the diagnostic accuracy of an echocardiographic examination. this noninvasive test has become one of the standard diagnostic tools in cardiology with an estimated 10 million echocardiograms performed annually in the united states.accreditation status signifies that the facility has been reviewed by an independent agency that recognizes the laboratory’s commitment to quality testing for the diagnosis of heart disease. the university of toledo cardiology physicians are committed to detecting, treating and preventing heart disease in the northwest ohio patient population and also serves patients in the bellevue, norwalk and wauseon areas.

art of the graphic novel in litgraphic





a new wave of critically acclaimed long form comic books, called graphic novels (a mostly grown-up version of the comic book), is the subject of a exhibition opening oct. 2 at the toledo museum of art.organized by the norman rockwell museum in stockbridge, mass., litgraphic: the world of the graphic novel examines the history, diversity and tremendous popularity of what is considered by many to be a comics renaissance.the traveling exhibition features more than 146 artworks by 24 contemporary graphic novelists and historic artists in this ever-evolving art form.litgraphic looks at the development of sequential art through its practitioners. their work continues to suggest new ways of seeing: wordless narratives by 1920s woodcut artist lynd ward and modern-day commentator peter kuper; revolutionary underground comix by r. crumb and humorous, personal girl stories’ by lauren weinstein; works by mad magazine co-creator harvey kurtzman and breathtaker co-creator marc hempel, and the pioneering art of will eisner (contract with god), dave sim (cerebus) and terry moore (strangers in paradise).original book pages and studies, sketchbooks and videotaped interviews with graphic novelists are featured.“art and literature have a certain symbiosis that is epitomized in an art form like the graphic novel, which combines a strong narrative with arresting visual images,” said don bacigalupi, director of the toledo museum of art. “this exhibition explores the art and history of the graphic novel through the work of a talented new generation of visual storytellers.”for centuries, sequential imagery has been a direct, efficient means of communicating ideas and information. from the cave paintings of early man to the hieroglyphics of ancient egypt and the ceiling of rome’s sistine chapel, pictures, when linked to convey an overarching narrative, have a unique ability to teach and inspire.during the 19th century, swiss artist rodolphe töpffer theorized about the creation of sequential picture stories and advised artists to “invent some kind of play, where the parts are arranged by plan and form a satisfactory whole.” his experiments with strip-like works employing character action and the passage of time were revolutionary in his day and set the stage for the development of the modern-day comic strips and books.the 20th century saw the rise of comics as a popular art form through the graphic albums of europe, japanese manga and the adventures of cultural icons such as superman and donald duck.although beloved by millions of readers, comics were not without their detractors who regarded the medium as a juvenile form of literature. underground comix, which originated during the counterculture of the 1960s, and the development of independent comic book publishers in the 1970s and 1980s, challenged this notion. these publications gave voice and depth to a full spectrum of characters, emotions and stories, opening up a new world of possibilities for this visual literary art form.some observers believe contemporary graphic novels, with their anti-heroes, visual appeal and edgy story lines are positioned to usurp the role that the novel once played.artists in the litgraphic exhibition include jessica abel, sue coe, r. crumb, howard cruse, steve ditko, will eisner, brian fies, gerhard, milt gross, marc hempel, niko henrichon, mark kalesniko, peter kuper, harvey kurtzman, matt madden, frans masereel, frank miller, terry moore, dave sim, art spiegelman, barron storey, lynd ward, lauren weinstein, and mark wheatley.two related exhibitions, storybook stars: award winning illustrations from the mazza collection and word play, open later in october at the toledo museum of art.storybook stars, oct. 9, 2009 – jan. 31, 2010 in the works on paper galleries, will offer 120 enchanting illustrations from artists who have won major awards for their work in children’s books. word play, oct. 16, 2009 – feb. 7, 2010 in gallery 18, will examine contemporary artists’ use of both text and graphics as a means of artistic expression.

get into jupmode





creator and officially licensed online retailer of unique collegiate products, jupmode.com has launched an epic new line of what we believe to be the sweetest graphic t-shirts for the university of toledo and bowling green state university so that their students, alumni, and faculty can all look a little sharper.unashamed of being a northwest ohio company, jupmode.com first transformed the way osu fans expressed their buckeye pride in 2007, providing them with the t-shirt version of jim tressel’s classy sideline uniform. described by the toledo blade as “one of the hottest items in the lucrative ohio state wardrobe line”, the ohio state university sweater vest t-shirt has allowed jupmode.com to expand its awesome designs and received two additional licenses in 2009 from the collegiate licensing company (clc) for the university of toledo and the licensing resource group (lrg) for bowling green state university.jupmode.com provides american made graphic tees with fresh designs so you’re not wearing standard logo t-shirts from china. these soft cotton tees are so comfortable you’ll never want to take it off. and you shouldn’t. but we do recommend you wash it every 2 - 3 weeks…uh, wears, so people aren’t trying to keep their distance. jupmode.com strives to bring people closer together, one fab t-shirt at a time.you can easily freshen up your collegiate wardrobe and accessories at jupmode.com, but if for some reason your internet is down, or you would like to feel the perfection between your fingertips in person, you’re not out of luck. these social life-altering tees will soon be available in the barnes & noble bookstores on each respective campus. if you’re not allowed on campus anymore – that’s creepy – but, you’re not out of luck either. jupmode.com tees are available in toledo at the newly opened nex clothing co. and will soon be available off-campus in bowling green at the student book exchange.
