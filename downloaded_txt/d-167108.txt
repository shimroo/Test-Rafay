established in 1825, hollister hill farm has four generations actively involved in its operation. spanning over 200 acres, the farm features a functional sugar house and boasts more than 200 tapped maple trees, contributing to our rich maple syrup production. in addition to our maple production, the farm is home to a vibrant wildflower garden and an organic produce garden, where we cultivate a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables. our pasture-raised pigs roam freely, ensuring the highest standards of animal welfare and contributing to our commitment to organic farming practices. at hollister hill farm, we strive to honor the legacy of our predecessors while sustainably managing our resources to provide fresh, high-quality products for our community.
