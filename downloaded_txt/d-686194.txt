noob friendly zone

whether you're new to jeeps or just new to the forum, this sub-forum exists for all the questions you might have but don't want to be flamed for posting something stupid. here, no jeep or forum related question is a dumb question so please post away. of course, if you're a long time member of wayalife, we'd love for you to help out where you can by answering what you can. otherwise, we ask that you please be respectful of the comments made in here or simply refrain from posting in this forum. thank you.

the hangout









give us a wave

as some of you may or may not know, it is customary for jeepers to wave at each other as they pass each other on the road. and, if it's not too much to ask, we'd like you to give us a 'virtual' wave here by saying hello, telling us a little about who you are and of course, all about your jeep!

the 8th slot

this is a virtual saloon, tavern, bar, pub or whatever you like to call your favorite watering hole.  here, members can discuss their favorite libations as well as just about anything else you might talk about with friends, unrelated to jeeps and in an adult establishment.  of course, the key word here is "adult" as in "r-rated" and potentially with foul language or topics that may be offensive to some. that said, if you are someone who is easily offended, i would recommend that you exercise some personal restraint and refrain from visiting this sub-forum.
