    note 1:   

    my vision is getting noticeably worse.  all my modeling 
    life i've been trying to find the holy grail of magnifying glasses  even when my vision was a lot better than it is now.

    so right off the bat i'm going to save you some time, frustration and money.

    you do not need any kind of magnifying, lighted headset-type magnifying 
    glasses to work with tiny modeling pieces.  what you need is a couple 
    sets of reading glasses and good lighting in your work area.  i was 
    snowed for so long by the modeling suppliers who tried to sell me all kind 
    of modeling magnifiers and they all pretty much are expensive, a pain to use 
    and don't work that well.  reading glasses work great - even cheap 
    ones.

    you're welcome.

    second note:

    i'm not a journalist.  i've never been to journalism 
    school.  i know nothing about journalism.  but i think there's a 
    rule that says if you change anything you've already published that you're 
    supposed to clearly note that.  i'm reading through this site for the 
    first time in a long time and finding all kinds of typos and things that are 
    badly or oddly worded and fixing them.  i'm not making any notes about 
    it.  if i change my viewpoint on a thing then i will but i'm not noting 
    small things i'm fixing like changing "it's" to "its", for example.   
    so some page dates will be recent (as of this writing) but that doesn't 
    indicate new or changed information unless noted.  mostly it's just 
    fixing misspellings and weirdly phrased things.

     



     


work is what i do 
	for the love of it.  a job is how i pay for it.
