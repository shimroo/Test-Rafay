more of a business destination than a tourism magnet, houston's booming restaurant scene is driven by big oil expense-account dining and locals who like to eat out -- a lot. kudos-worthy chefs serve up outstanding fare all over the city, from old-fashioned steak and potato favorites to cutting-edge culinary creations in places where décor runs from down home to rain forest. ethnic eateries stretch from brazilian, chinese, greek, german and french to indian, italian, japanese, lebanese, mexican, 
south american, thai, vietnamese and 
beyond. as a houston tradition for celebration and dining since 1936, the fabled brenner's steakhouse got its start as brenner's café after herman brenner (a waiter at the grand dame rice hotel) and wife lorene scraped together $20 ($10 for the land, and $10 for building their restaurant). eventually making way for construction of katy road, the couple relocated to create the present lush garden site that caught on with old-time oil men who could afford to chow down on $3.50 prime beef fillets.  reflective of today's houston menus, brenner's has expanded well beyond beef and potatoes to include artichoke and spinach fondue, australian lobster and shrimp remoulade.
