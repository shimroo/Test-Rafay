highlights from the national research center on poverty and economic mobility

this forum investigated inequitable outcomes by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, and ability and how federal, state, and local human services policies, systems, and providers contribute to it. participants also discussed how policy, practice, data, and research can combat systemic inequities created in and outside of human services. inequities continue to create barriers to success and well-being for many individuals and communities in the united states. the field of human services can play a crucial role in advancing equity for these populations, but to do so must identify the ways in which it creates or perpetuates disparities.
