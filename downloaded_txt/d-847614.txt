random but.....
i've just re-read some of my own fanfics that i wrote, back in the day, when i had more time with my day, or my evening, unencumbered by work. and i forgot i wrote some of that. i loved it. (humble as i am...)  i want to do more of that, and by golly, that's going to be my resolution.  i need to write.  i have some longer term plots that i've started and never posted because i have not gotten far enough, but even if i can't do that... i need to start writing the short fics, or the one shots, or anything really.  i need that creativity to blossom - and screw the work - it will always be there!
