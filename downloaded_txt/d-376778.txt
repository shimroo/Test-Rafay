wings theatre
wings theatre   is a non-profit, off-off broadway 
company founded in 1986.  our mission, since our inception, is the 
development and production of new plays and musicals by american playwrights and 
composers.
 
in april, 2011, wings lost the lease on our 
home of twenty years in the archive building on christopher street.  as a 
result we are on hiatus and not currently producing as we regroup and examine 
our options for the future.
