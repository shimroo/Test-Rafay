			nes osa is now nes optica and has moved



the new england section of the optical society of america has decided to align our branding and messaging with our parent organization, optica. as part of this transition we are proud to announce that we are changing our local section name to be the new england section of optica. along with this change of name, we're using this opportunity to update our logo and launching a new website.
please visit our new homepage at nesoptica.org
we're excited for the features we can implement on this new site, including improved event registrations, auto-renewing membership and dues, an improved membership directory, and an overall more streamlined experience.
this site will continue to stay up for now. eventually we hope to transition the whole talk backlog to the new site.
