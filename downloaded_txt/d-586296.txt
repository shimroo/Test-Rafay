what people are saying... 
"there are a lot of cadd programs out there.  they all tout
        themselves as being the most logical, most powerful, most
        "user friendly" program on the market.  for our money
        cadvance has given us a powerful, intuitive cadd
        program capable of performing dramatically well in our busy
        office.  no other product gives us the ability to have a new user
        up and "flying" in a week, and that means profit." 
         ~ dave tierney, stuck associates,
        jonesboro, arkansas





"...after slogging my way through autocad, (i have) found
        cadvance refreshingly simple...i would like to commend your company in
        having produced a unit of software that does not require several months
        on the learning curve to begin to produce workable drawings.
~ dale schoepflin, mosier farms, ellinwood,
        kansas





"cadvance leaves you free to think about what you're
        doing instead of being distracted trying to control or manipulate
        the software."
  ~ chris mayner, principal of computerized office
        plans and environment (cope) ltd.
   




"compared to autocad, the
        program is cheaper and just as powerful for electrical design...it is
        easier to use and set-up where new users can learn the system quite
        easily.  autocad finally in acad 2000 has a fully functioning
        windows system which cadvance has had since v5.  great
        program!  customer support is excellent!  the only way to get
        help with autocad is through an "act of god"
   ~john lang, p.e. 





"thank you for your continued support of my drafting
        program.  my students really enjoy working with cadvance and it is
        a pleasure to teach with such a powerful program.  we have lots of
        fun learning."
   ~terry brandin, instructor at armuchee high
          school, georgia





"what a great program
        cadvance is!  i have used unigraphics and autocad and prefer
        cadvance.  it gets better to use the more you use it. 
        fantastic."
          ~christopher tchorzynski,
        tool designer and residential designer (25 years), whitmore lake,
        michigan 





"i want to express my gratitude for all of the
        courteous and helpful technical support given to me...  i cannot
        remember ever having such friendly, responsive, and helpful technical
        support anywhere.  thank you very much."
          ~sarah miller, universal event services, inc.
