wintercamp is held each year over the martin luther king, jr. weekend in january.  this session is designed specifically for kids in middle and high school.
summer is the busiest time of year at central florida bible camp.  seven summer sessions are held, generally from the middle of june through the end of july.  campers from kindergarten through high school ages can find one or more sessions designed specifically for them.
all of our camp sessions are coordinated and staffed by volunteers who are all faithful members of churches of christ.  these servants love the lord, love kids and love bible camp. they have a passion for serving and a compassion for kids and are great christian examples. over 1,000 campers and volunteers will participate in our camp sessions each year.
