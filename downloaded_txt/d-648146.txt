for more than forty years control instruments corporation has dedicated their expertise to the industrial community, providing safe and efficient environments for companies worldwide. we engineer and manufacture high quality solutions to both simple and complex gas detection problems, leaving your facility, employees, and environment safe and secure. our highly successful gas detection systems are the industry standard for lower flammable limit (lfl) and total hydrocarbon monitoring, and are installed and used under the most demanding conditions, from printing, coating, and flexible packaging processes to semiconductor, pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers. control instruments corporation’s family of gas detection products includes continuous process analyzers, btu analyzers, flammable gas monitors, oxygen monitors, and remote access and control devices for all of your gas detection and solvent vapor monitoring needs.
process monitoring
lfl sensors for measuring flammable gases, vapors, mixtures of multiple solvents, in low oxygen, elevated temperatures, and inert atmospheres. btu analyzers for direct measurement of calorific value, ranging from 0 to 1300 btu/ft3.
emission monitoring
for monitoring hydrocarbon destructive systems, solvent recovery breakthrough, waste incinerators, and other voc applications.
area monitoring
for measuring flammable gases, oxygen, or toxic gases.
remote access and control
for viewing, accessing, and controlling multiple remote sensors from a convenient central location.

obsolescence





although it is our long-held policy to support legacy products, we need to advise of the obsolescence and lack of availability of some systems. please see this memo for more details.
our team would be happy to assist you navigating this process.
