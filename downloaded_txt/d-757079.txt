cassandra’s tears by patrick jones



descended from a long line of ancient creatures, cassandra grey looks like a regular teenager except she is not human, she is a tear collector. just as vampires need human blood to survive, tear collectors need human tears produced by grief, anger, and other intense emotions. as a high school student, cassandra rarely has problems gathering tears for herself or her family. fresh off murdering two students to protect her secret, cassandra’s life is thrown into turmoil when a new family matriarch emerges, a new potential boy victim appears, and a new source of tears challenges her to resist feeling human emotion as she encounters at her volunteer job the daughter of a dementia patient.
