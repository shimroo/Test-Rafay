amazing option near the port!
stopped here to grab lunch during a cruise stop. was a short 10 minute walk from our boat and i'm so glad we found this place. alicia was our server and she was amazing! the pizza was so good, some of the best we've ever had!! the servings are huge, we ordered a medium pizza for 2 of us and were stuffed by the end of our meal, had quite a few slices left over.
victoriaashleyc must try
wow- this place is a must-try!! we stopped by this weekend for a couple of drinks and pizza and couldnât have enjoyed our experience more. the manager christopher is very kind and generous. we were looking to buy a t-shirt, and while they didnât have any for sale, christopher was courteous enough to give us a staff t-shirt for free. definitely stop by!!
lauren w easy and friendly place!
friendly atmosphere and kind waiters ! variety of food: from pizza (we didnât tried) to local dishes, local drinks (beer and fruit cocktails). and also an unexpected cheesecake! suggested if you are looking for a rest or an easy dinner with something of local (vegetables, potatoes, rice, chicken) with flavors not to much far from ours!
