social security is an important source of retirement income, so its necessary to know how much social security you will receive when you begin taking your benefits. the amount of social security benefits varies depending on the year you were born, your lifetime earnings, and the age at which you begin receiving social security benefits. you can start to receive social security benefits as early as age 62, but waiting to receive benefits might be beneficial. to make the best decision for your individual situation, you’ll need to know your full retirement age (fra), which is the age at which you’ll be eligible to receive your primary insurance amount (pia). special rules apply to current, former, and widowed spouses claiming social security benefits, and strategies offer married couples; divorced, widowed, or surviving spouses; and single workers the opportunity to maximize benefits throughout retirement. we’ll illustrate how those rules work and provide examples of how the claiming strategies can increase the amount of social security benefits for some recipients. estate planning estate planning -
