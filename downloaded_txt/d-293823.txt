most people view bees as nuisances or fear them out of fear of getting stung. contrary to popular belief, bees are actually harmless creatures (unless you aggravate them). they play an integral role in producing our crops, honey, and wax, all of which are essential human amenities. despite their vital role in society and the ecosystem, bees can pose a danger to human safety and health when they set up their base in unwanted locations such as schools, homes, and other public areas. under such circumstances, a miami dade bee removal becomes necessary to ascertain the safety of both bees and humans.
types of bees you may have

-honey bees
-bumble bees
-carpenter bees
how the removal works
expert bee removers are not callous. they do not exterminate the bees but rather remove them humanely. some bee removers use insecticides in small amounts or sprinkle diazinon or carbaryl powder around colonies or colonies to make the place inhabitable.  
bees that establish their nest in walls, like honey bees, are complicated to remove. in order to get to the hive, the wall covering the hive will have to be taken out. trying diy methods to remove the hive will only worsen things, and so will delaying. you should note that honeybees produce and collect honey quickly. over time, a single colony can make more than 100 pounds of honey inside your walls and pounds of beeswax combs. 
a deep-rooted colony is way more difficult to remove than a fresh one. if the honey is left to accumulate, it will ferment and produce gas that destroys the cells supporting the sweet stuff in the honey. when this occurs, that gluey honey can get into your drywall.
skilled and humane bee removal professionals take away bees without killing them. the first step usually entails locating where the colony has established its base. some use a stethoscope to find it, tap the wall with a small hammer, and others may use a wire to poke through the wall to find the colony.

live bee removal vs. extermination
with live bee removal, we remove the bees alive and relocate them to a new location without harming them. the goal is to safely and thoroughly remove the bees, and get rid of any remaining bee wax, honey, hive, and debris to prevent re-infestation. this can be done on trees, structures, pillars, statues, or anywhere else bees can swarm. 
extermination is rarely a good option for getting rid of bees from your property. it kills honey bees unnecessarily, not to mention the contamination it causes. the only exceptions where extermination may be preferred are if the bees are in a highly populated area, especially if they pose a danger to human life. however, extermination is almost always a last resort. 
some people may choose bee extermination just because it’s often cheaper. however, most services will only kill the bees and call it a day. this means the hive and honey are left behind, which will soon attract more bees. the honey left unattended can also fall apart and seep into the area, causing several issues. cheap extermination is not worth the time and money you’ll spend remediating these problems in the future. 
moreover, honeybees are important members of our environment and food ecosystem. their populations are dwindling, and they should be preserved at all costs.

tips to for successful beekeeping for beginners: what first-time bee keepers must know
gathering the right information is the best preparation for anyone planning to try their hands at beekeeping for the first time. one way is to enroll in beekeeping classes with a reputable association or institution while also exploring the internet for learning resources to help you understand what lies ahead.
to begin with, start by identifying the breed type you want, a strategic and stable position or location for the activity, and the suitable type of bee hive to buy. remember that the three factors will impact how you harvest the honey, maintain the hive, and the serenity needed by the bees for a healthy and productive life.
when done right, bee-keeping can be an exciting and hugely rewarding hobby and outdoor activity while guaranteeing a constant supply of honey. and as far as the environment is concerned, you will greatly support pollination – a vital prerequisite for a balanced ecosystem in your local area.
ordering your bees
generally, getting your bees in the winter is not advisable as the cold weather makes it difficult for the bees to forage for food. during the cold season, the bee focuses all its energy on warmth retention.
the best time to set up your hive is during the spring because of the warm weather conditions and the blooming of flowers that enables the bees to gather their food. usually, timing is one of the most important tips for beekeeping for beginners.
type of hive
when looking for the type of bee hive to buy, consider the cost and ease of operability and maintenance. also, the place you intend to keep your bees may influence the bee hive design you buy. in addition, you need a durable product to get value for your money.
the major bee hives are the langstroth hive, the warre hive, and the top bar hive. however, the langstroth hive is more popular among first-time beekeepers.
choosing ideal location
look for a level and steady surface to place the bee hive. in addition, the location must be sheltered from strong winds. ideally, look for a place where the bees can enjoy the morning sunshine and get enough shade in the afternoon.
also, the area must be free from noise, heavy traffic, and similar disturbances to keep the bees healthy and productive.
maintaining the hive
observing the health status of your bees is a critical requirement for successful and rewarding beekeeping. for instance, you should make sure the queen bee is healthy and producing eggs normally.
if you’re collecting honey, save some aside for the bees, especially in the winter when they can’t go out and get food on their own.
you must provide the pollinators with sugar water to ensure their survival and growth.
tools that will be needed
to avoid getting stung when gathering honey or tending to the hive, it’s important to wear protective gear like mittens, a beekeeper’s suit, a cap, and a veil.
while you get back to work, the bees may relax thanks to the smoker.
-a hive tool helps you shift the frames inside the hive.
conclusion
of course, selecting the ideal breed to buy is also an important consideration for beginner beekeepers. some popular breeds are buckfast, which is popular for its honey production. italian breed is also good for honey production, while carniolan is popular for its calm nature. among others, we hope the above tips for beekeeping for beginners can help you kick start your venture from a knowledgeable perspective.

research has shown that just getting outside can have enormous psychological benefits. the feeling of the sun on the skin and the sound of the breeze in the trees, as well as the smell of grass and flowers, can help to reduce stress levels – and who doesn’t need that? with the advent of summer, it’s time to take full advantage of the outdoor opportunities – and this includes the company of friends and family in the yard. but, summer also means bees – and sometimes that can mean trouble.
almost everyone likes bees. even those who are allergic to stings enjoy the gentle buzzing as these wonderful insects go about their daily business – and who doesn’t like some honey on their pancakes? but when bees swarm in search of a new place to locate their hive our yards exert a siren call – and that can spell danger for family, friends (especially the children), and pets.
taking a look at the behavior of bee colonies quickly reveals why professional bee hive removal is so important.
bees may be one of nature’s marvels – but disturbing a hive is a way to flirt with an extended stay in an emergency ward, or worse. in probability the bees that you see will be honeybees. these can be dangerous when disturbed – they will attack anyone in the vicinity of the disturbance in an effort to protect their hive and their queen. the hive becomes even more of a threat if it has been constructed by killer bees. these bees arrived in the u.s. from mexico in 1990. they are hybrids of african bees and european honeybees, bred to increase honey output. the result was a species of bee that is responsible for many deaths. they will chase down anyone who disturbs their nest and attack unceasingly until the threat has been eliminated – and that behavior can lead to death.
however, using a professional bee hive removal company will ensure that you and those nearest and dearest will remain safe. bee hive removal is not a task that falls into the ‘diy’ category – it can simply ‘bee’ too dangerous.
professional bee and pest control companies have the right equipment to ensure that problem bees are removed from your property quickly and efficiently – and at a reasonable cost. skilled removal can mean that honeybees, in particular, can safely and comfortably be relocated to the premises of a concern that raises bees for honey.
by seeking out a professional bee removal company that employs an eco-friendly approach the homeowner not only spares the bees but also ensures that honey supplies remain constant – and even more importantly that bees can go about their essential business of pollination, ensuring that we can continue to enjoy wonderful fields of wildflowers – and that our yards look great – just right for summer.
if you discover an unwanted hive on your premises then give the professionals a call, it’s simply the right thing to do.












pest control for bee removal: why it’s not a diy job!

when it comes to your home as well as the health and safety of your family, you know that certain jobs require professionals— namely, plumbing and electrical work. homeowners are often more than willing to hire contractors for certain types of work, but when it comes to pest control services, they often prefer a diy approach. most homeowners wrongly assume that bee removal is as simple as spraying the hive with insecticide and the problem is solved, right? wrong! removing an entire hive of bees is dangerous work rife with difficulty and the potential to get hurt in the process.
you may still shake your head and think that a diy approach is adequate, but let us convince you otherwise!
*bee removal is hazardous work
there are numerous issues with taking a diy approach to bee removal. firstly, it’s dangerous work that means putting yourself and your family at risk for getting stung when you don’t know what you’re doing. it’s also unlikely that you have the necessary experience or the tools for the job to do it well and humanely. additionally, many hives are located at great heights such as near the roofline or on tree branches, therefore, attempting to climb a ladder makes it even easier to fall and injure yourself in the process.
*everything needs to go!
in order to consider a bee removal complete and secure, everything needs to go— that includes the bees themselves and their honeycomb. leaving even a small trace behind of these unwanted tenants will trigger pheromones that attract even more buzzing pollinators. of course, not to mention, predators and other insect varieties may also get triggered by the pheromones left behind. most novice homeowners aren’t aware of this and also don’t have the skills necessary to perform a thorough removal job.
*not a humane solution
the real problem is that bees are becoming endangered, and as such, it’s important to protect them in any way that we can. most homeowners are unable to remove an entire hive in a humane manner that doesn’t hurt the bees in some way. since bees aren’t nuisance insects and play a crucial role in the pollination of our environment, they should be protected, and actually, there are stringent rules in place for handling them. most aren’t aware that it’s illegal to hurt bees, especially through the use of commonly found insecticides at hardware stores. for this reason among many others, opting for a live removal pest control service is a responsible and humane way to handle your buzzing problem!
get professional assistance today!
hopefully, you’re now well aware of the dangers that lurk with the possibility of taking matters into your own hands. removing bees live in a humane manner and relocating them is crucial to their survival. not only is it woefully dangerous for you and your family to interact with these pollinators, but you may inadvertently end up hurting the entire hive or killing their queen. even if you have the best of intentions, nothing beats the surety and peace of mind offered by professionals!
