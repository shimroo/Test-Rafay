testimonials 










						the first time she said "i love you mom," you know these little things that we take for granted are possible because of kids on the move and the loving people you have there.					


natasha eldredge 






						being able to play with other kids - i thought that was never going to happen because he was just so far behind. now i know his dreams aren't over. my dreams for him aren't over because kids on the move has showed me that.					


alicia lopez 






						parenting a child with mental health challenges is a journey, not a destination. it's okay to seek help and remember, you're not alone.

the future 



shaping the future of care: a bold vision for children and families 



at kids on the move, we believe every child deserves the highest level of care and resources to thrive. unfortunately, the current system often leaves children with disabilities navigating fragmented, inconsistent care that limits their potential. but we’re changing that. 





hope in motion is our vision for a new standard of care—a model that goes beyond the status quo to provide children with a comprehensive, world-class level of support. our goal is to redefine what it means to care for children with disabilities, offering integrated, top-tier services that address their unique needs and help them reach their fullest potential. 



by elevating the level of care and creating an all-encompassing approach, we aim to set a new benchmark for disability care that others can emulate. this is more than just providing services; it’s about building a system that gives children the best chance to thrive and empowering families to focus on what matters most—being parents. 




through hope in motion, we’re leading the way to a future where children with disabilities have access to the care they deserve—care that’s connected, comprehensive, and world-class.
