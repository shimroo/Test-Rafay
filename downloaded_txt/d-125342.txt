my top tier business review: how to make easy money 

my top tier business has been trending in the online market as a potential tool for business growth and to make money online. to make use of this tool to earn money, you first need to know what it is and how it works. rest assured that this my top tier business review will explain how it works and will clear any confusion that you may have about this application. mostly referred to as mttb, this application was created by matt lloyd, one of the most successful internet marketers. the guy has earned over 4 million us dollars using this application and his fortune is increasing as of this moment. to join him in this business venture, you can read the below my top tier business review to get an idea of how this works.
this is an easy to understand process where you can make $1000, $3000 and $5000 worth commissions online without much effort. as explained in the introductory video, this is an easy 21 step process that can help you make at least $1000 in the first three weeks of getting the license. you can sell the owner’s products via this application and make up to 90% commission on every sale you make online. the training assists you through the money making process so that you can effectively use this application.
as the name indicates, this tool makes use of top tier products only. basically, once you sign up for mttb, you get access to top tier or high priced products that belong to the original owner, matt lloyd. you can sell these high valued products online to earn a lot of money. matt allows you access to these products once you have paid for the license. getting the license allows you to work as a potential business partner in making sales and earning money.
with each sale you make, you get a huge commission as a salesman working on lloyd’s behalf. in this manner, you can sell products that don’t even belong to you and make thousands of dollars in a few days. the more effort you put in bringing new buyers, the more money you make. bringing potential buyers for these products is an important task. you can just buy the license and hope to make money just by sitting idle. if that’s what you are planning, then mttb is not for you.
this my top tier business review is going to reveal the best thing about mttb. if you don’t want to work very hard at sales, that is okay. the reason is that the products are high priced, and with a single sale, you can make $500 commission. suppose you sell only three such products online in the first couple of months, even then your total profit will be $1500. so if you are willing to spend a little time on using mttb to sell top tier products, you can easily make a couple of thousand dollars every month. if you are an enthusiast and are willing to invest more time, you’ll reap more money as a result.

network marketing leads 

whether you are new to the home business industry or you are a seasoned network marketing veteran, you would probably agree that leads are the lifeblood of your business. let’s face it, without leads, business dries up really fast. with the amount of turnover in the mlm world, you have to continue to bring new people into your business.
the goal of most network marketers is to build a residual income. the idea of making money while you’re on vacation is what brings many people into this business, but in order to earn that residual income you either have to recruit new people (which usually doesn’t happen while you’re on vacation) or keep people around. when your prospect gets excited, joins your business, and then goes mia within the first 2 weeks (which happens more often than not) it is tough to make that residual income that we all want.
i have one solution that addresses both issues. 
find the easiest way to attract and recruit new business partners. you’re probably saying, “tell me something that i don’t already know.”
here is what happens when you master recruiting. 
1) you recruit a ton of people into your business (well, duh).
2) if you teach your people how to master recruiting, they don’t quit.
so what is the secret to recruiting? 
first of all, don’t listen to anyone who tells you to make a list of friends and family. most of them won’t be interested or qualified. more importantly, even if you happen to be ok with recruiting your warm market, the majority of your prospects won’t be. that is why the majority of people don’t ever get into this industry. they don’t want to bug their friends and family at the risk of being labeled “that guy”, and they don’t know of any other way to recruit.
so what’s the answer?
generate your own mlm leads online. you can take a look at this article to get an a good idea on how to generate your own mlm leads using the internet.
network marketing lead generation doesn’t have to be a struggle anymore. rather than chasing after people who have no interest in hearing about your business, let the internet filter out all of the people who aren’t interested and attract all of the people who are. think about it, if you can get your opportunity in front of people who are actively looking to start their own home based business, don’t you think you have a much better chance of making a connection with them?

it’s time to get with the times, and use technology to your advantage. for more information on how to use the internet to do your recruiting for you, visit lazymlmleads.com.
to your success,
jason mann
