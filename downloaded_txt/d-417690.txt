"a heart felt thank you to everyone at westside montessori school!some 17 years ago, we found ourselves in houston as new first-time parents trying to raise, what we can now admit was, a “difficult” toddler. we were 2,000 miles away from our closest families and had bounced around from day care to day care before we found westside. my wife was convinced that this was the one but i remained skeptical (it is my nature).our older son, did not embark on the montessori journey alone because he dragged us along with him. we are grateful for that experience because we learned more about our son through his struggles and triumphs, and we believe the “hands on” approach prepared us to be better parents – not just for him, but for our other 2 sons, who later attended westside as well.when the time came to move on, none of our sons wanted to leave westside because it was all they had known. it was like leaving home! there was apprehension and nervousness on all sides. fortunately, their westside experience prepared them well for “life on the outside”. in fact, all the former westside students we know at their school have done well – making the honor rolls from time to time and participating in extracurricular activities.as parents, we shepherded our sons through middle school and high school but this time it is different. it is our turn to say goodbye because our younger son, will be leaving westside at the end of this week. we now find ourselves filled with mixed emotions as we thank and bid farewell to the wonderful teachers and staff at westside! we are filled with such fond memories of the good times as well as the struggles that we shared over the years. we are glad we were able to give back to westside and the community and will cherish forever the great friendships we have made over the years.thank you for taking such good care of us over the years! we will always be a westside family. even without a parking spot, we will visit from time to time!"

"amazing teachers, principal, facilities, and classroom materials. the families are wonderful. the school puts on lovely events. i am so happy with the quality of education at westside montessori! i have a masters degree in education, and have lived overseas—my children have always studied at private schools, and i am very impressed with the child centered, modern pedagogy here." 



michelle lwms parent 

"i have two children both in wms since the toddler program, and now they are in the 5th grade and 3rd grade. i can not be happier for my decision to enroll them there. it is true that this hidden gem is missed or hardly mentioned when parents in the area are considering for a private education institute. wms truly carries out the consistent teaching of montessori education in every classroom and every level of programs.my kids are very shy and quiet, yet they feel loved and accepted by everyone and are very comfortable at school. they were never once not wanting to go to school and that means something. daily, they are taught routines, boundaries, and are given guidance; at the same time, freedom to thrive. every teacher they had in the past and have currently, helps build their confidence, motivation to learn, and personal responsibility. all of which contribute to their academic and personal well-being. as for academic, my 5th grader reads and writes well beyond her level. math, science, geography, cultural study, and art are taught. then kids apply what they have learnt in their school projects. when my younger child was going thru a rough phase in primary program, everyone was very willing to work with us.education is a team endeavor, and i'm glad wms plays a big part in my children's development. if you're a parent looking for a school setting for your child, please call the school for a tour and see it for yourself. you won't regret it."

"extremely happy with this school. has had my kids both in lower and upper elementary for several years now. the teachers are caring, patient and engaged (can't say enough good things about mr. gordon of upper elementary!). the activities are designed specifically for the age of the kid. they always come back with exciting stories involving gardening, animals, insects. we used to have them attend a nearby private school before wms, and the rigidness of the "traditional" method is night and day compared to this. the fact that they pool 3 grades per level (lower is 1st, 2nd and 3rd while upper is 4th, 5th and 6th) builds resilience and "people skills" in them. life's about dealing with people who are different from you. my 2 kids have benefited tremendously from the change from "traditional" system to the montessori system at wms. their afternoons are freer, they're more relaxed, and definitely happier compared to when they attended the "traditional system". my view regarding rigorousness of curriculum: they will have plenty of time to pull all-nighters and stress about school later in life, but their elementary years must be as free and happy as they can be. no point in throwing them into the "rat-race" educational culture this early.sure, the small student body makes socially for a reduced circle of friends, but that comes with the territory of small classrooms and more teacher attention. also, the school has no athletic programs, so don't expect many extra curricular activities like soccer practice, football, or cheerleading. however, they have plenty of field trips to compensate for that. the parents are down to earth and laid back. very welcoming culture. finally, wms is as diverse as it gets. my kids have classmates from every corner of the planet. russians, turkish, uzbeks, nigerians, brazilians, pakistanis, indians, venezuelans, and mixed-nationality families are the norm."

"we started at westside in 2019 and couldn't be happier. the school is doing a tremendous job at keeping our children safe, learning, and genuinely happy. the teachers and families work in collaboration to meet each student's needs. the holistic approach is much appreciated!" 



zola swms parent & board member 

"our children have had a fantastic experience at westside montessori. from the moment you walk through the front door and are greeted by the staff you can feel the warmth and sense of community. the teachers are so dedicated and committed to nurturing the children and making sure that each receives a quality education. when our youngest was in primary and was struggling with printing his "b's" and "d's" his teacher immediately recognized his frustration and so as not to discourage him she allowed him to try cursive. he excelled in cursive handwriting and never made those mistakes. she of course continued practicing his printing with him, but gave him another task which he could do that would motivate him. that's just one example of the care and creativity put into teaching that the faculty exhibit at wms. the administration has also been very responsive and supportive of families, especially during the upheaval that covid has caused." 



former middle school student testimonial from niche.com 

we spent over a decade at the school from toddler to middle school. this is review is for the middle school. this is a true montessori school. the teachers and staff were very supportive of each students learning goals and styles. with a small class of around 12 each child was allowed to progress at their own pace with no child being left behind for the sake of the overall class' progress. the every 6 week trip was the highlight of the young adult program with students' attending model un in new york, various camps, and learning trips around town. the school, being a co-op, allowed parents to know each other well and build long lasting bonds. both students and parents were given many opportunities to volunteer during and after school hours. although not officially an international school, i felt like were were in one. many different languages and cultures represented. at our festival of nations there are routinely 60+ countries represented.
