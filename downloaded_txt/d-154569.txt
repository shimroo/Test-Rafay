who can symbols help?
widgit symbols can  help users of all ages, abilities and backgrounds who have difficulties with  text or communication in settings ranging from nursery schools to dementia care  homes.



 symbols in education

                "i can't really quantify the impact of widgit within the school without saying it's just amazing! without having access to the symbols and the programs we would not be able to function as a school.

                these children would not be able to go through the day as they do independently."
a headteacher



 parents, carers & symbol users

                "i would like to thank you and your team from the bottom of my heart.

                your symbols have been life savers for my severely autistic son. the quality of life for our family is so much better."
parent of a child on the autism spectrum



 healthcare & justice 

                "being able to reassure someone in an emergency is key to my role as a first responder. to be able to do this, i need to communicate well.

                widgit medical communication aids, make me more confident that i can bring calm in the widest range of situations"
a community first responder



 social care & charity

                "inprint helps the children to tell us what they cannot communicate to us orally...

                they feel secure, having all these tools at hand, this gives them a sense of safety and confidence that they are not rejected by the people around them."
antonina,
                breadline



 government & local authority

                "by using widgit symbols, people who have speech and language difficulties or are non-verbal were able to access and understand what participation means to them."
sarah-louise davies, 
                children & young people's commissioner, scotland



 tourism, leisure & arts

                "we are delighted with the symbol resources. they are professional, engaging and attractive to our customers. most impressive are the symbols which were created uniquely for our pantomimes, such as the character symbols, which help us to bring the pantomime to life for all our customers."
 zoã« briggs,
                ambassador theatre group 



 signage & designers

                "i think one of the most exciting and innovative parts of this project is the creation of the symbol/tactile signs.

                these symbols are such an asset to the non-verbal children who use the playpark and help them with their communication."
miriam guard,
                the playpark 



 international use of symbols

                "using accessible and illustrative symbols resulted in immediately increasing interest in reading and enrichment of sensory experience activities.

                more accessible information on the timetable with the widgit symbols had a noticeable effect among students."
dorothy fraser
