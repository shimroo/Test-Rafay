bahamas shouldn't be a "sad hunk"





 photo: dave gillespiealfie jurvanen (bahamas) shouldn't be, and he probably isn't, living in beautiful nova scotia and raising a young family. so, perhaps he's a happy hunk? though, i'm not the best at judging my fellow man's sex appeal. but, music on the other hand, i have no problem judging, and i bring my gavel down, hard, on the verdict: guilty. guilty of twisting the tiniest, fattest, slinkiest, most melodic guitar notes into three to four minute gossamer songs. his soft, half-spoken vocals ground the more delicate song fibres, his voice being the heavy bones as his guitar notes sway in the air like a model's hair on a commercial for clairol herbal essence. the fellow artist who comes to mind, easily, as alfie's overlapping guitars take flight, is fleetwood mac alumnus, lindsay buckingham. canadian artist, bahamas, released their latest, sad hunk, on october 9 2020.  stream on spotify. his record label, brushfire.

the notwist -  vertigo days





six years since the notwist have released a new album. six years? it was something like seven years since i had posted about music here on this blog. 
i've loved this band for close to twenty years. not all of their stuff, but bits and pieces have glued themselves to me over the years. take a look at their output here at alien transmission, and pick your way through the label roster for your own sticky bits.

here's a chance to hear a new track from the band's latest, vertigo days, with vocal by juan molina. and below that you can stream an old favourite, 'off the rail', from neon golden 2002

is anyone out there? i'm back. 





so, it's been a while (years). how are you? things have changed, life kicked me
hard. but, still... there's music to listen to (and to fall in love with). in
fact there's years of stuff to discover and to start with i want to point you
toward the melodic pop of
andy shauf. there's beauty
in sadness when it's conjured with minor chords, a lonely voice, and the
masterful arrangements of andy shauf's. andy's
arts & crafts page. his
page at anti records. you'll find all his music on his bandcamp page.

forrest gump given wes anderson treatment?





robert zemeckis's classic starring tom hanks has been, in a tiny way, given a wes anderson style make-over. louis paquet has wondered  what the film's opening credits would look like anderson-ified. here they are and i like.

todd terje 'it's album time'







if any of you have wondered why this blog has slipped away into one of the millions of dusty corners of the internet, today i came upon a prime example of 'what' caused this... pitchfork's current golden boy, todd terje.

 all electronic, all disconnected... his songs off of  it's album time exhibit a lack of nature, a lack of skin and bone, of fingers hitting, plucking, striking an instrument of wood and skin...they are disconnected from nature.

the copper wires, circuits and binary codes only strengthen the wall between natural and unreal. oh, yes, there are rhythms and melodies, but no matter how sharp and clear they still carry a sterility borne of science's clinical heart and the cradle of technology from which they came.

there are more than enough robots and computerized circuits in our lives today, just let music breathe on its own.

will someone just pull the plug on this binary music and see if it can breathe on its own... please?

todd terje's album is the sound of kidnapped acoustic music trapped in an iron lung of motherboards and drivers. sounds to make the robots dance... i'll sit this one out.

alice boman: new song "what" with video








 it's fantastic to hear new alice boman music, fantastic as it hasn't lost it's unique personality while still being a more 'hi-tech record' (she's moved on from intimate home recordings to a cabin in the woods).



 alice came to us as a soft baby bird you gather in your hands, watching it easily settle into it's new nest of fingers, skin and bone. that soft baby bird is still there, you can almost feel the feathers blossoming from her lips with a voice of quiet aching and wanting. buttressed by an everpresent piano, her new song,"what", will give you shivers, blue shivers, up and down your willing spine. and feathers to tickle your blues away, or keep it company until the sun comes up.






 



 alice's new ep, titled simply ep ii, will be available june 3 via the control group in north america, adrian recordings in scandinavia and happy death throughout the rest of europe.
