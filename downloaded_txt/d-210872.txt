                            larry kirwan's defiant and celebratory irish-american tour
                        









rockaway blue





rockaway blue is a novel by larry kirwan. when terrorists attacked on september 11, 2001, lieutenant brian murphy rescued seven people from the world trade center. even as steel girders buckled and groaned, brian rushed back up the stairs of the north tower in search of those in need. he died a hero, one of more than four hundred police officers, firefighters, and other first responders who perished that fateful day.
                                three years later, vietnam veteran and retired nypd detective-sergeant jimmy murphy is on a mission to find the truth behind his son's death. why was brian in the tower that morning? had he anticipated the attack? suspecting a cover-up of a deeper truth, jimmy must confront his family, friends, and old colleagues in the police department to discover what happened to brian and who his eldest son really was.
                                
rockaway blue is now available at amazon, b&n, all digital platforms and, of course, at your favorite book store.
                            



rockaway blue an evening with larry kirwan





                                since there will be no live readings for some time, hereâs a reading/performance from rockaway blue with two new original songs and a black 47 favorite. filmed at the noble maritime collection located at snug harbor, staten island, ny it captures some of the drama, power and poignancy of the book and its characters.
                            



stronger and better





stronger and better is a song for now. itâs a tribute to our heroes, the frontline workers, a lament for those who died needlessly, and a note to those who failed to act. âwe will come through this stronger and better.â

                                liberty hall, dublin, on january 19, 1916.  when he returned four days later his only comment was, âi have been
                                through hell.â  he had been held captive by the clandestine irish republican brotherhood â a group that he had

hard times had already sold out by word of mouth before a glowing new york times review brought waiting-list crowds to the cell last year. this riveting new american musical that touched the hearts of public and critics alike will commemorate the 150th anniversary of stephen fosterâs death on jan. 13th, 2014.
hard times (written by larry kirwan of black 47, directed by kira simring and produced by the cell) takes place six months before fosterâs death on july 13, 1863, days after the battle of gettysburg, when new york city exploded in the civil war draft riots. the teeming immigrant irish population was outraged that enlistment could be avoided by payment of $300. down in the notorious five points neighborhood where up until then irish and african-americans lived in harmony and often âamalgamated,â nelly blythe runs an integrated dancehall/saloon. 
stephen foster, ashamed of his role in the creation of minstrelsy and blackface, and haunted by memories of his wife (for whom he wrote jeanie with the light brown hair), seeks refuge in nellyâs to compose one of his last songs. as violence escalates in the streets, foster becomes entangled in the simmering tensions that arise between owen duignan, a charismatic young irish entertainer, thomas jefferson, nellyâs black handyman, and michael jenkins, a nativist bowery boy with little love for outsiders but an obsession with nelly, a freeborn black woman. 
in this watershed american moment, we witness the forging of tap from the exhilarating interplay of african-american and irish dance, learn why foster chose to end his days in the squalor of the five points, and experience the birth of modern new york city. we also rediscover the genius of stephen foster, as the multi-talented cast ebulliently sweeps the dust off his wonderful songs and in so doing allows us a glimpse of the tumultuous glory of america at a crossroads in her history.


theater review
back to a simple time, when things were about to become difficultâhard times: an american musicalâ at the cell theaterâgangs of new yorkâ may have helped to revive the memory of five points, the notorious 19th-century slum in lower manhattan, but no one probably considered it the stuff of song and dance â until larry kirwan, the novelist, playwright and, not incidentally, leader of the rock band black 47. now at the cell theater as part of the 1st irish theater festival, mr. kirwanâs rousing âhard times: an american musicalâ examines the clashes among nativists, irish immigrants and free blacks, ingeniously using the life and works of stephen foster, americaâs first great songwriter, to tell the tale.
itâs the summer of 1863, and foster (jed peterson) is holed up in his favorite five points saloon, trying to eke out another song as he slides deeper into his cups. just outside, the draft riots are starting, and the very character of the points â a neighborhood where poor whites and blacks live together easily enough â is under siege, with ethnic frictions about to explode, presaging the difficult future that awaits the city after the civil war ends.
the crowd in the bar includes nelly blyth (almeria campbell), the black woman who owns it; owen duignan (john charles mclaughlin), the young irishman who fronts her house band; thomas jefferson (stephane duret), nellyâs black handyman; and michael jenkins (philip callen), a nativist new yorker who hopes to court nelly. in flashback, we also meet fosterâs wife, jane (erin west), for whom he wrote âjeanie with the light brown hair.â tensions are eased by fosterâs songs, though the music is also used to comment on the building drama.
placing fosterâs songs in an ideal setting to understand their impact, mr. kirwan has reinvigorated them, with members of the full-throated cast singing a fiery âcamptown racesâ; a tender âoh, susannaâ; a soulful âold folks at homeâ; a stirring âhard times come again no moreâ. (no slouch with a lyric himself, mr. kirwan has added the tart stanza or two to foster classics and contributed a couple of songs as well.)
while clearly respectful of fosterâs legacy, mr. kirwan does make one leap, intimating that he was gay, a conclusion no biographer has reached. still, for the purposes of this story, the speculation fits, informing fosterâs drinking, his long separation from his wife and child, and the melancholy that laced many of his later songs.
under kira simringâs sure-handed direction, âhard timesâ bursts with vitality: the cell, an intimate space, becomes the saloon, burlap draped along the walls, a tattered flag hanging. the choreography, by joe barros, morphs irish step-dancing into something close to tap. and the showâs band of five men, led by andrew smithson, feel like characters themselves, joining in the revelry when the pace quickens.
by the end of the evening, the audience is up, cheering and stamping. in âhard times,â mr. kirwan has not only delivered a knockout entertainment, heâs done a public service, reacquainting us with the foster songbook and the striving, teeming america for which it was written. — by daniel m. gold
hard times bursts with life, thanks to kira simringâs inventive staging and the superb singing and dancing performed to the accompaniment of a first rate, five-piece band. the tension is immediately established when young irish singer/dancer owen (a terrific john charles mclaughlin) performs a bitterly angry rendition of âcamptown racesâ in blackface. by the near-climactic, rousing rendition of âhard times come again no more,â you may find yourself believing they wonât.  new york post
the small cast infuses their roles with intensity and detail as well as musical muscle. director kira simring makes intriguing use of the small cell theatre space.  choreographer joe barros delivers robust dancing based on irish and african-american traditions, and music director andrew smithson gives vibrancy and power to the score, which combines fosterâs classic americana with kirwanâs modern sensibilities. backstage
hard timeâs musicâoriginal songs by foster updated by black 47 member kirwanâis gorgeous. particularly striking is mclaughlin's somber version of "gentle annie," a genuinely heartfelt song that foster based on a traditional irish melody. also charming is "hard times come again no more," a soaring, at times-a cappella rendition from the entire cast.  village voice
musicals can be irritating, their manufactured emotion unbearably phony. larry kirwanâs âhard times,â however, is not just the best of the genre iâve seen, but truly affecting. the rest of the audience was also demonstrably moved at one of the extra performances laid on during the showâs largely sold-out run as part of the 1st irish theater festival. this is the story of the hard birth of the modern u.s., told mostly through the songs of stephen foster.  irish echo
just as tony kushner was able to bring into focus his understanding of the hard times facing america near the close of the twentieth century with his âangels in americaâ larry kirwan has been able to successfully bring into focus the issues that face twenty-first century america and threaten to damage the very core of its credo. âhard timesâ is a remarkable and memorable moment of brilliant theatre. theatre reviews limited
true to the melting pot that was five points, kirwan takes the colors in fosterâs melodies and paints broad strokes of cajun, gospel, bare knuckled piano boogie woogie, jump blues, and of course, irish jigging and reeling.  irish voice
hard times is an ebullient, stirring and relevant american musical. âold folks at homeâ is a revelation. as the song moves toward its heartfelt conclusion, it becomes downright moving.  ny irish arts

what a long strange trip over the last decade or so. we began 2000 with trouble in the land â pretty prophetic when all is said and done, and a couple of years back we released bankers and gangsters - the title says it all. 2014 will mark our final cd, last call.
for mychal, richie and the other cherished fans who departed back in 2001; for strummer, danno laursen, johnny byrne, big john murphy and all those who worked with the band; for the many who have celebrated new yearâs eve with us over the last 21 years; and, of course, for new friends whoâve come aboard in this decade, thanks to all of you for your support and friendship. 
we only perform this song once a year and on new year's eve itâs just for you, so feel free to come along and video or audio tape it at midnight.

new yearâs eve in olde tymes square

it was always that way at the end of the year
weâd end up down in olde tymes square
holdinâ each other while the pints flowed free
that was the way it always would be
but things fell apart one weird september
before i knew it was the 31st of december
with my arms wrapped around your memory
that old crystal ball came crashinâ down on me

but you will never be forgot
or ever left behind
and so i raise my glass to you
for the sake of auld lang syne

and even though youâre far away
youâre always close to mind
your memory still haunts me, dear
for the sake of auld lang syne

for auld lang syne, my dear
for auld lang syne
weâll drink a cup of kindness yet
for the sake of auld lang syne

remember the night with the frost in your hair
and the sparks in your eyes when you told me you cared
and the cop on the horse laughed when he said
âmotel time, kids, why donât yez save it for bed?â
but time and a river stopped dead in september
and iâm back in connollyâs the 31st of december
dancing with shadows and might have beens
with that old crystal ball crashinâ down on me

but you will never be forgot
or ever left behind
and so i raise my glass to you
for the sake of auld lang syne

and even though youâre far away
youâre always close to mind
your memory still haunts me, dear
for the sake of auld lang syne

for auld lang syne, my dear
for auld lang syne
weâll drink a cup of kindness yet
for the sake of auld lang syne...

                                friends as when we first played together.  we just have a simple wish to finish up at the top our
                                game after 25 years of relentless touring and, as always, on our own terms.  the last gig we played
                                at the south buffalo irish festival was as good as any we've ever performed.  our goal now is to play
                                another full year plus and dedicate all of those gigs to you who've supported us through thick and thin.
                                rather than just running out the clock we will be recording "last call," an album of new songs in november
                                and as usual will be working out the material onstage.  we would like to say goodbye to you all personally
                                and will make every effort to come play in your city, town, college, pub, club, performing arts center and
                                should you wish to alert your local promoter you can download booking particulars

                                black 47 has always been more than a band, we've spoken out for the nationalist population in the north of ireland,
                                against the war but for the troops in iraq, for our gay brothers & sisters, immigrants, legal and undocumented,
                                as well as for the voiceless of 1845-47; but in the end it all comes down to the music, the songs, and the desire
                                to give audiences the time of their lives and send them home smiling and, perhaps, with a question on their lips.
                                we look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming gigs.  thanks for the support and the memories -
                                lets make many more over the next year.

                                1980-82, the bronx is burning, bobby sands is
                                dying, john lennon is being stalked, the reagan
                                revolution has begun and aids is about to be
                                identified. but life goes on in the immigrant
                                bars of bainbridge avenue as sean arrives from
                                ireland looking for his girlfriend, mary, and
                                finds a lot more than he bargained for.
                                

                                "this is a bronx tale full of raucous life and
                                unvarnished reality. it captures a time when the
                                bronx had become a synonym for urban decay and
                                conflict, and a new generation of irish
                                immigrants struggled to get a toehold on
                                america.

                                phony-baloney version of multicultural harmony.
                                this is the urban american of the 80s in all its
                                raw squalor and splendor. every page sparkles
                                with memorable characters and lyrical accuracy."
