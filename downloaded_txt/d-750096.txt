blown away by my two nieces performance at their dance recital. amazing!






i was recently visiting family in livermore and was blown away by my two nieces performance at their dance recital. amazing! but perhaps i shouldn't have been surprised as my nieces are always raving about their dance classes every time we talk or skype. it's all they want to talk about. it was also nice to finally put a face to this tiffany lady that they talk about incessantly. she couldn't have been nicer.alan b.

















i recommend tiffany's to all of my friends!






i signed my daughter up a few years ago and didn't expect her to love it as much as she did.  the teachers have all been amazing-- so patient and kind to the children. its definitely more of a professional school to enroll your child in. there is constant communication of what is going on, so they definitely keep us on track when there's so much else going on in our lives.  i recommend tiffany's to all of my friends!d.j.

















we love tiffany dance academy! we've had our two girls in their studios for over six years and continue to be impressed with them.






we love tiffany dance academy! we've had our two girls in their studios for over six years and continue to be impressed with them. there isn't excessive pressure on the studios that you see at some studios and yet the results i've seen are fantastic. the staff is wonderful as well, from the teachers to administrative team to those running the business. really looking forward to my kids continuing to grow with them over the years.cali b.

at this studio she can dance in a relaxed atmosphere with a couple of recitals a year.






my daughter has a lot of fun here. she dances with ms. stephanie and loves her! we are not in it for my daughter to become a professional ballerina. she just wants to dance with no pressure, and feel like part of a team/family. at this studio she can dance in a relaxed atmosphere with a couple of recitals a year. malika a.

















we loved tda before covid but have even more respect for them as they've figured out how to keep things fun and consistent.






we loved tda before covid but have even more respect for them as they've figured out how to keep things fun and consistent. my daughter has loved every teacher she has had and the staff is wonderful to work with.natalie h.

















we love tiffany's! very professional!






we love tiffany's! very professional! teachers and all staff are very nice. i've attended a few other events from other dance studios in the area and it does not compare! thank you tiffany's for all that you do!leslee m.

















i cannot believe how they have stepped up the plate to make sure the kids still have their dance class.






classes are still on so if you were thinking about joining or coming back i highly recommend. personally i cant wait to see the  virtual recital in august and am blown away the planning that has happened to make that occur. im rambling in my gushing now but it has been such an honor, thank you tiffany's!!!!!gwenn e.

















recital was the best part!






recital was the best part! the dancers always have the most eye catching, super cute costumes (that come with a heartbreakingly hefty price unfortunately). they have the best props for the chosen theme and they don't miss a thing in assuring that everything comes out perfect. the father/daughter dance warms your heart. my husband truly misses those precious moments.candy c.

















miss nicole brought out the best in my daughter.






my daughter was a part of their competition team for three years with miss nicole as her instructor. miss nicole brought out the best in my daughter. she is an outstanding person all around and all the families simply adore her.candy c.

















we love tiffany dance academy!






we love tiffany dance academy! we've had our two girls in their studios for over six years and continue to be impressed with them. we were looking for a studio that had the right balance of nurture and structure, but was also one our kids could grow with through the years and we found it. our older daughter has been doing ballet, tap, jazz, hip hop, and is in the performing company where she is able to attend conventions/competitions and compete. cali b.

















the teachers are great and professional






the teachers are great and professional. my niece has had miss.jessica for a year now and the improvement has been extremely noticeable from her last studio. she is very friendly and dedicated.paul b.

















it fills my heart with joy to see my little one love dance class so much.






my 4 year old is in the twinkle stars and she genuinely loves going to class. it's a great balance of structure and play, the music is awesome and her teacher, miss desiree is great. it fills my heart with joy to see my little one love dance class so much.gaby m.

















my granddaughter has grown so much as a dancer in two years we've been here and i wouldn't dream of going anywhere else.






i love tiffany's. this is my second year and rebecca is the reason i stay!  being a newbie, i have so many questions and she always helps me. always!!! i've seen her go out of her way to everyone who walks in the door. she's extremely knowledgeable and polite. my granddaughter has grown so much as a dancer in two years we've been here and i wouldn't dream of going anywhere else.debi d.

















i watched their nutcracker show last night & it was stunning!! impeccable & beautiful!!






my daughter loves going to her ballet class with miss jessica! we are at the fremont location & the studio director, ms. rebecca has been very helpful & kind to us ... i watched their nutcracker show last night & it was stunning!! impeccable & beautiful!! i would absolutely recommend tda!!!!janet s.

















her teaching style is laid back and fun






omg i'm getting teary eyed right now because ms. jessica is truly wonderful and an amazing person and the owners of this company are so fortunate to have her as one of their own. ms. jessica is the sweetest, kindest person with the children and parents. her love for the kids and what she does shines. she is the reason we love this academy. her teaching style is laid back and fun but i think that's good for the young growing dancer. the kids love her too!jessica c.

















i especially appreciate that tda took covid-19 seriously






my daughter has been with tda for more than 3 years. she took different classes at the fremont studio, e.g., ballet, jazz, hip hop, tap. i especially appreciate that tda took covid-19 seriously and implemented the necessary procedures early in the pandemic, then also created the new dancily online program. it provides me with a very good alternative when i don't feel comfortable yet to send her back for school / extracurricular activities. the new studio manager, miss alida also helped a lot in the last 12 months.king o., tda fremont studio
