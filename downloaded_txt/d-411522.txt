welcome to
west hills tractor




west hills tractor was a ford-only dealership owned by harvey usary of jonesborough, tennessee until 1972. that year, jerry and jimmy foster were driving trucks to deliver gas for their father's business r.y. foster exxon gas service located on 208 crown street in johnson city, tennessee. jerry and jimmy stopped by west hills tractor and convinced harvey to sell them the original all-in-one sales, service, and parts building and 2.5 acres of the property. jerry and jimmy didn't have any funding for this transaction so they inquired the local banks for a loan. r.y. was "in the gas business, not the tractor business" so securing a loan without a signature from r.y. was very difficult. after hours and hours of meetings with different bankers, first people's bank in jonesborough agreed to a loan within 10 minutes of jerry and jimmy walking in the door. the rest is history.
