client reviews















i was awestruck by ann marie's knowledge of skin care for woman over 50. i am particularly impressed with how much she knows about keeping mature skin looking its best with the right products, treatments, and makeup techniques. she has a wealth of knowledge and is current on all the latest trends. i spent a session with her learning more about caring for my skin, along with tips for doing my makeup, and am so glad i did! i will  have ann marie do my makeup for any big events going forward. i can't recommend her highly enough!
– deb w.











i am going to shout about an incredibly talented artist who recently worked her magic on me—and i mean magic! ann marie laurendeau is amazing. she really loves working on older actors, she is knowledgeable about our skin, and she uses such skill and wonderful products. she transformed me, yet the makeup looked natural. the cool thing is ann marie offers personal makeup lessons! i can’t imagine i’ll be able to recreate the look she achieved, but i am definitely going to reach out to improve my makeup skills. i am blown away by this artist!
– mary h. 











ann marie has done my makeup on multiple occasions, most notably my wedding. she was the easiest vendor to decide on. i trust her implicitly, and her communication before the event was fantastic. everyone in my wedding party loved their looks, and we got so many compliments and felt incredibly confident. as a bonus, ann marie is the loveliest person, and i always have the best time working with her and her fantastic team!
– amy n.











i am so glad the classes are small so ann marie could take the time to work with each student individually. her careful instruction allowed me to achieve amazing results on my models. i look forward to participating in other classes and building my portfolio so i can start my freelance business.
