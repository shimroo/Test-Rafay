our approach here at the griffonrawl academy is simple, "if it doesn't work, we don't teach it". all 
of our programs are not only designed to benefit those who intend to compete, but are also
designed to teach self-defense while getting you in shape. mixed martial arts is currently one of the fastest growing sports in the world
today! however, do not be fooled, the styles we teach have proven their effectiveness inside and outside
of the ring time and time again. competing is not a mandatory requirement for attending any of our 
classes. competitions we currently compete in are muay thai, boxing, bjj, & mma. 


here is a little about our academy. we are about 5,000 square foot. we have a 30'x40' section of zebra mats, a 20' boxing ring, 
a 20' competition cage, plenty of heavy bags, and pads. last but not least we have mens and womens shower rooms available.


offering classes in muay thai, mma, judo, boxing, wrestling, & brazilian jiu-jitsu !
