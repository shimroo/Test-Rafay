â  â why americans are so violent



warrior nation
the historical roots of
																																																																																						american violence
by
																																																																																						howard smeadâyou must understand that
																																																																																						americans are a warrior nation.âââ â 
																																																																																						senator daniel patrick moynihanâ a pastoral america of
																																																																																						strong, resolute, and honorable people steeped in christian values and democratic ideals
																																																																																						â¦ centuries of violence in the pursuit of honor, conquest, revenge, glory, and
																																																																																						material gain. mob actions, mass murder, lawlessness, and war.
â  â  â we cherish one america, overlook
																																	the other. then every so often wonder where all the violence is coming from.
â  â  â for all its well-deserved
																																	exceptionalismâand it is well-deservedâamerica is also an exceptionally
																																	violent country with an exceptionallyâ violent history. the americas were
																																	violent before the europeans arrived, and got even more so once they did. the
																																	settlers fought and conquered the native inhabitants, they fought other nationals
																																	for dominance, and they fought among themselves for preeminence. in what became
																																	the united states, murder and mayhem date back to desperate colonists clinging
																																	to life on the edge of a vast and, in their view, untamed wilderness. the struggle
																																	for survival and the competition for empire led to conquest and genocide. ethnic
																																	and religious rivalry created rioting, rebellion, and repression in the form vigilantism
																																	and lynching. the 20th century brought serial killers, mass murder, and
																																	heavily armed hate groups threatening civil war. and all that sits on top of slavery,
																																	segregation, marginalization, and continued repression. all these and more have
																																	made america singular among western nations.[1]â â â â  
â  â  â and
																																	we ask plaintively why such violence?
â  â  â in
																																																																																						his sweeping history of american crime, lawrence friedman puzzled over this
																																																																																						question, âwhy is the united states such a violent country? why is there so
																																																																																						much serious crime? â¦ is american history, tradition and experience to blame?ââ  â  â the
																																																																																						answer to this question lies in a rather remarkable combination of ideas,
																																																																																						events, attitudes, and conditions that make up our history. it lies in the
																																																																																						nature of the countryâin the different creeds and conditions that set america
																																																																																						apart from other countries. it lies in many of the ideas and traditions flowing
																																																																																						from them that constitute the basis of our exceptionalism. the causes are complex and changing. and it is extremely
																																																																																						risky to blame american violence on any one factor. the bottom line is this: america is not now nor has it ever
																																																																																						been an assemblage of âpeaceable kingdoms.â[2]violent
																																																																																						exceptionalismâ... cannons were
																																																																																						brought into play, and a pitched battle developed on orleans street, near the
																																																																																						belair market, between the eighth ward democrats â¦ and the sixth and seventh
																																																																																						ward know-nothings. at first driven back, but not to be outdone, the
																																																																																						know-nothings brought forward and unlimbered a small swivel [gun], and the battle raged â¦it was astonishing
																																																																																						how many boys were engaged in the fighting, and how many of these were shot
																																																																																						while looking on.ââeyewitness
																																																																																						account of 1856 election in baltimore, maryland[3]â writer james
																																																																																						truslow adams, who coined the term the âamerican dream,â considered violence to
																																																																																						be âone of the most distinctive american traits.â[4] and he had a mountain of
																																																																																						facts on his side. ââ¦ american life has always been characterized by violent
																																																																																						conflict,â says sociologist joseph s. himes, âvirtually every sector and group
																																																																																						in the nation has been caught up in violence at some time.â[5] our
																																																																																						greatest president, abraham lincoln, himself the very personification of the
																																																																																						exceptional, remarked as early as 1837 that a profound threat to the âproud
																																																																																						fabric of freedomâ was âthe caprice of the mob â¦ which pervaded the country,
																																																																																						from new england to louisiana.â he predicted dire consequences if americans
																																																																																						didnât stop leaving âdead men â¦ literally dangling from the boughs of trees
																																																																																						upon every road side.â[6]â â â â â â â â â â â  violence
																																																																																						started at plymouth rock and never let up, changing only in target and method.
																																																																																						it was especially nasty during that holiest of holies the american revolution.
																																																																																						conventional wisdom still clings to the myth of the revolution as âa polite
																																																																																						conflict led by gentlemen who could sully neither their reputations nor their
																																																																																						silk clothes with atrocities.â in fact, the revolution was a civil war in many
																																																																																						quarters. neighbors turned on neighbors, families fought families, patriot mobs
																																																																																						seized tory property and executed the owners. âpatriots â¦ did not tolerate
																																																																																						doubters in their midst. either you are for us or against us, they insisted.â
																																																																																						patriot committees forced enlistment, and imprisoned, banished, and tortured
																																																																																						those who refused, or seized or destroyed their property. âoften local
																																																																																						vigilantes preempted the committees by hounding those in their midstâ¦â[7]â  as richard maxwell brown described it, âthe
																																																																																						meanest and most squalid sort of violence was from the very beginning to the
																																																																																						very end put to the service of revolutionary ideals and objectives.â this after
																																																																																						almost 200 years of slaughtering (and being slaughtered by) indians. the
																																																																																						american revolution sanctified violence and its implicit logic that the end
																																																																																						justifies the means, and it has stayed with us ever since.[8]
â â â â â â â â â â â  this remarkable passage from richard maxwell brownâs
																																																																																						seminal work, strain of violence
																																																																																						helps set the stage for what he calls the âviolence of the âcomplex presentâ of
																																																																																						american life today.the era of the american revolution was marked by a series of
																																																																																						outbreaks in town and countryside. urban violence runs from the stamp act riots
																																																																																						in 1765 through the sons of liberty violence, the boston massacre, the burning
																																																																																						of the gaspee, and the boston tea
																																																																																						party to the incident that triggered the revolutionary warâthe fighting at
																																																																																						lexington and concord. concomitant with that the urban violence of the 1760âs
																																																																																						and 1770âs were the outbursts of violence in rural america: the paxton boysâ
																																																																																						uprising in pennsylvania and the regulator movements in north and south
																																																																																						carolina, the emergence of the so-called âcrackerâ as a violent southern
																																																																																						prototype on the colonial frontier, the rise of lynch law in virginia, and the
																																																																																						bloody indian wars. the 1760âs and 1770âsâas well as the 1670âs and 1680âs, the
																																																																																						1830âs through the 1850âs, the 1870âs through the 1890âs, and the 1960âsâhave
																																																																																						been among the peak periods of violence in american history."[9]types of violencetypes of social violencethe deep roots of american violencea guide to mass shootings in americaâ  â  â  fast
																																																																																						forward through the nativist violence of the 19th century, the civil
																																																																																						war, the age of lynching, to âthe 60s:â riots by the dozens; assassinations;
																																																																																						terrorism on the left; terrorism on the right; police riots; mass murder;
																																																																																						serial killings; violent crime; cultural upheaval; a difficult-to-explain
																																																																																						foreign war; a cold war that sanctioned all manner of federal, state, and local
																																																																																						privacy violations in the name of national security; and a defense policy that
																																																																																						seemed to sum it all up: mutual assured destruction (mad)âall while the
																																																																																						children of those defense strategists were being trained to duck and cover in
																																																																																						response to a nuclear attack in hopes of delaying vaporization by a nanosecond
																																																																																						or two.[10]â  the possibility scared the hell out of
																																																																																						everyone, and sparked great cynicism,
																																																																																						though a rosy view of the past persists. â  â  â  the final report of the kerner commission study of
																																																																																						american civil disorders concluded that âacts of collective violence by private
																																																																																						citizens in the united states in the last 20 years have been extraordinarily
																																																																																						numerous â¦ in numbers of political assassinations, riots, politically relevant
																																																																																						armed group attacks, and demonstrations, the united states since 1948 has been
																																																																																						among the half dozen most tumultuous nations in the world.â[11]
																																																																																						the irony of this somewhat breathless report was that america had experienced
																																																																																						much greater civil strife. nearly fifty years after the kerner commission
																																																																																						report, every time a spectacularly heartless mass shooting occurs, americans
																																																																																						are forced to think about themselves in a different light, at least for the
																																																																																						subsequent twenty-four hours. each new outrage seems to arrive via its own
																																																																																						avenue of causation. after the may 2014 murder of seven people in isla vista,
																																																																																						california, by a rejected twenty-two-year-old with a deep grudge against women
																																																																																						and the men they choose, mainstream media raised tough questions about misogynist
																																																																																						white men. [12] the massacre of twenty-six children and adults at sandy
																																																																																						hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut in
																																																																																						december 2013 brought an anguished discussion of mental health issues and marginal
																																																																																						parenting; the july 20, 2012 mass shooting in aurora, colorado,
																																																																																						resulting in twelve
																																																																																						dead movie-goers and seventy wounded implicated
																																																																																						violent films and video games. â an alienated,
																																																																																						nativist white man killed six worshippers and wounded four others at a sikh temple
																																																																																						in oak creek, wisconsin, on august 6, 2012âwithin
																																																																																						a few months of one another. from the first mass slaughter in july 2012 to the
																																																																																						last, may 2014, less than two years passed. not too much before those
																																																																																						incidents, a military psychiatrist with terrorist dreams killed thirteen
																																																																																						military men and women at fort
																																																																																						hood, texas, on november 5, 2009, wounding thirtyâdiscussions of politics,
																																																																																						religion naturally followed. as did the pearl-clutching about race that
																																																																																						occurred after the death of trayvon
																																																																																						martin in 2012. other factors are at play here, factors that when taken in
																																																																																						combination offer the most cogent explanation for this apparent nightmare: our
																																																																																						history.ââ¦the past is never dead. itâs not even pastââwilliam faulknerâ  â  â  faulkner
																																																																																						said this about the south, but i think it holds for the entire country. these days no one makes any
																																																																																						pretense about the american people being genteel folk, even though the rosy
																																																																																						view of the past persists. to an uncomfortable degree, america is a
																																																																																						product of its bloody history. whether it is the slaughter â of fifty-eight
																																																																																						at a country music festival in las vegas or twenty
																																																																																						children and six adults in newtown, massachusetts, on december 14, 2012âboth
																																																																																						for unknown reasonsâ or the radical
																																																																																						islamist inspired slaughter of forty-nine in orlando, fl, the spree-killing
																																																																																						of thirty-two atâ virginia
																																																																																						tech on april 16, 2007, or thirteen at columbine
																																																																																						high school in colorado on april 20, 1999, or twenty-one shot dead at a mcdonaldâs
																																																																																						in san ysidro, california, on july 18, 1984, or a riot in south
																																																																																						central los angles from april 29 to may 4, 1992 leaving 60 dead, or over
																																																																																						200 riots during the âlong hot summersâ of 1964, 1965, 1966, and 1967 and an
																																																																																						additional 243 after the april 4, 1968, murder of martin luther king, jr.,[13] or of the torture, rape
																																																																																						and murder of eight
																																																																																						chicago student nurses on july 14, 1966.â  â  â  these sad cases of mass murder are but the latest aspects of
																																																																																						americaâs violent culture. mass murders have spiked over recent decades, but
																																																																																						they should be seen in context as another phase of violent activity, public violence
																																																																																						enhanced but not necessarily created by the availability of firearms with
																																																																																						greater firepower.[14] take just this one
																																																																																						example from the past. on october 18, 1934, a marianna, florida, mob of several
																																																																																						thousand tortured, mutilatedâby excision of fingers and toes for
																																																																																						souvenirsâcastrated (and forced the victim to eat his severed genitalia), then
																																																																																						dragged the man behind a truck and topped off the murderous spectacle by
																																																																																						hanging the bullet-ridden corpse in the town square. the mob followed this up
																																																																																						by roaming through the streets of the town attacking black people at random.
																																																																																						when it was over, the local newspaper, which had advertised the impending
																																																																																						lynching, complimented the crowd for its good behavior. this for a crime the
																																																																																						victim did not commit.[15]â  â  â  perspective is important here. through the 1960s the
																																																																																						united states ranked about 14th out of eighty-four western nations in incidents
																																																																																						of violence; hardly auspicious, though not bad overall, given our population
																																																																																						size and geographic diversity. another survey put the u.s. first in civil
																																																																																						strife among western democracies but twenty-fourth among all nations.[16] we must always keep this
																																																																																						in mind: the united states is not now and has never been âthe most violent
																																																																																						society that history has ever created,â as former terrorist bernadine dorhn
																																																																																						once claimed. not even close. neither are the american people more depraved or
																																																																																						barbaric than other peoples. they are not. they are neither the best behaved
																																																																																						nor the worst. america is, as richard hofstadter put it, âa full-fledged and
																																																																																						somewhat boisterous member of the fellowship of human frailty.â governments,
																																																																																						warlords, despots, and religious leaders of totalitarian nations of one stripe
																																																																																						or another have rained death on their own people and others beyond their
																																																																																						borders at grotesque proportions that dwarf anything the u.s. could ever be
																																																																																						accused of. as richard slotkin writes, âthere are no equivalents in american
																																																																																						history of the programs of ethnic genocide carried out by the turks against the
																																																																																						armenians or the germans against the jews; nor of the political genocide
																																																																																						practiced by stalin and mao against opposition or dissident movements.â[17] so, my point is not that
																																																																																						america is the most violent nation. my point is simply this: america is a violent nation with a violent history. generations of violence heaped upon
																																																																																						generations of violence have molded us into the nation and people we are today.
																																																																																						the historical record and indeed popular culture do not remotely support any
																																																																																						other assessment.[18]â historical amnesiaâ â  âwe americans are a
																																																																																						peace-loving people. we seek friendship not only with our traditional allies
																																																																																						but with our adversaries, too.â ââ â 
																																																																																						president ronald reaganâamericans
																																																																																						who came of age during and after the 1930s found it easy to forget how violent
																																																																																						a people their forebears had been,â and, as hofstadter reminds us, historians
																																																																																						have done little to remind them. for them, âconflicts between groups of
																																																																																						citizens, no matter how murderous and destructive, have been forgettable.â no
																																																																																						less a figure than henry adams thought americans were âa people whose chief
																																																																																						trait was antipathy to war, and to any system organized with military energy.â[19]
																																																																																						while the history of american violence is well documented, until recent times
																																																																																						it was largely absent from the history books. âwhat is most exceptional about
																																																																																						the americans,â richard hofstadter commented, perhaps with adams in mind, âis
																																																																																						not the voluminous record of their violence, but their extraordinary ability,
																																																																																						in the face of that record, to persuade themselves that they are among the
																																																																																						best-behaved and best-regulated of peoples.â[20] in 1968
																																																																																						the national commission of the causes and prevention of violence, defined this
																																																																																						phenomenon as âhistorical amnesia.â one political scientist defined it as âthe
																																																																																						persistence of belief in the â¦ aberrational quality of political violence.â or,
																																																																																						as hofstadter explains, âa history but not a tradition of domestic violence.â[21]
																																																																																						youâd have to wonder, though, if hofstadter was overlooking such traditional
																																																																																						values as popular sovereignty, the code of the west, rugged individualism, and
																																																																																						manifest destiny, all of which carry a least a subtext of violence.â  â  â  when this amnesia combines with a national attention span
																																																																																						measured in hours if not minutes, it makes for a naive view of the american
																																																																																						past.[22]
																																																																																						to this day an accurate understanding of the past eludes the public and is, in
																																																																																						fact, being actively and often intentionally distorted, especially by
																																																																																						right-wing media and dissident conservative political movements.[23]
																																																																																						hofstadter, who came late to the realization of our violent, conflict-ridden
																																																																																						history, recognized the oddity of our lack of a cultural tradition of violence
																																																																																						despite a history where violence was âfrequent, voluminous, almost
																																																																																						commonplace.â[24]
																																																																																						this ânon-traditionâ was embedded well before the american revolution.
																																																																																						historian gordon wood framed this in an interesting way. âbeginning with the
																																																																																						revolutionary movement (but with deep roots in american history) the people
																																																																																						came to rely more and more on their ability to organize and to act
																																																																																						âout-of-doorsâ whether as âmobs,â as political clubs, or as convention.â he
																																																																																						labeled americaâs long, pre-revolutionary history of mob violence
																																																																																						âextra-legislative action.â[25]
																																																																																						thatâs putting it mildly. it was gruesome violence involving all manner of
																																																																																						torture and humiliation. given the foundersâ well-documented distrust of the
																																																																																						middling sorts and the lower order that was behind someâbut by no means allâof
																																																																																						the bloody activities, they may well have responded to this assessment by
																																																																																						questioning the difference among the three forms of outdoor activity. â  â  â  the violence got worse during the actual revolution, where
																																																																																						barbarism by patriots against loyalists and british and mercenaries was ghastly.
																																																																																						the casualty rate was higher than in all our wars except the civil war;[26]
																																																																																						the death rate among prisoners was the highest in all our wars. the relatively
																																																																																						small numbers look insignificant, but they are a true indication of the level
																																																																																						of this extremely violent and bloody revolution that in most quarters of the
																																																																																						country was more of a civil war with the patriots exacting a high price from
																																																																																						british troops and officials and american loyalists.[27]â  â  â  the
																																																																																						reasons for this collective memory loss may simply reflect a desire to forget
																																																																																						unpleasant and painful events. but i think it underscores an important
																																																																																						characteristic of american violence. namely, that american violence has always
																																																																																						lacked a unifying ideological or political core. mob action and vigilantism did
																																																																																						not share a common philosophical or political thread. they were about local
																																																																																						issues. violent acts werenât communist, fascist, anarchist or monarchist, or
																																																																																						even anti-monarchist, they were local and autonomous. although there are
																																																																																						pronounced racial and ethnic themes, rioters have come from all shades of the
																																																																																						political spectrum. they have been white and latino as well as black. they have
																																																																																						been protestant and roman catholic and secular. similarly, violence has
																																																																																						appeared in all parts of the nation. it lacks a geographical locus. although
																																																																																						the south has been the most violent region, owing to its connection to the
																																																																																						inherently violent institution of slavery, lynchers, anti-labor thugs, and
																																																																																						eye-gougers have cropped up in every quadrant of the map. every time we try to
																																																																																						puzzle out the latest act of wanton violence, a brief exercise this nation of
																																																																																						intellectual lard butts doesnât particularly enjoy, concern exhausts itself in
																																																																																						a flurry of apocalyptic warnings and survivalist fantasies about societal
																																																																																						collapse. rest assured american society is not going to collapse, although too
																																																																																						much mayhem might well stunt its growth. why wonât it collapse? hereâs the
																																																																																						monumental irony of it all: america is too violent to collapse.stability through violenceâwe are â¦ heartily
																																																																																						sick of this atmosphere redolent of insane violence â¦ there is a strong party
																																																																																						adverse to violent men and violent measures, but they are frightened into
																																																																																						submissionâafraid even to exchange opinions with others who think like them,
																																																																																						lest they should be betrayed.ââjoel
																																																																																						poinsett, southern political leader (1850)[28]â âviolence is as american as cherry pie.ââ â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â  âh.
																																																																																						rap brown (1967)to
																																																																																						brownâs famous dictum, we might add, â¦ and institutional stability as american
																																																																																						as apple pie. this is the huge caveat that is crucial to understanding how why
																																																																																						and how we are violent, and one of the enduring paradoxes of american history.
																																																																																						republican society stresses order, place, personal liberty, and equality, in
																																																																																						that order. violence, especially as some form of vigilantism, has often
																																																																																						resulted when liberty and equality conflict. lingering effects of these clashes
																																																																																						surface from time to time in places as disparate as the matthew shepard
																																																																																						lynching in wyoming, or the rodney king riots in south central los
																																																																																						angeles.â  yet, no matter how one manipulates the statistics, whether
																																																																																						ranking america high in domestic or foreign violence or higher than most
																																																																																						nations, america comes out consistently as one of the most stable of all
																																																																																						nations. as british writer g.k. chesterton observed in 1922, âamerica is the
																																																																																						only nation in the world that is founded on creed.â[29]
																																																																																						despite all the mayhem, only the far right disparages that creed. natural
																																																																																						rights and democracy in the context of a republican form of government have
																																																																																						proven vastly preferable to monarchy, theocracy, oligarchy, communism,
																																																																																						socialism, fascism, militarism, plutocracy, anarchy, or any other form of
																																																																																						government that has been dreamt up. no, american violence is not about
																																																																																						overthrowing the state; itâs about maintaining the state, or at least a certain
																																																																																						view of it. the history of american violence is a history of a paradox:
																																																																																						terrible violence and amazing stability. our stability ranks easily with the
																																																																																						most stable western nations such as england and scandinavia, while in terms of
																																																																																						violence the u.s. looks more like a banana republic in the western hemisphere
																																																																																						or an emerging third world nation in the eastern.[30]
â â â â â â â â â â â  the widely shared myth among
																																																																																						americans is that freedom means little or no government involvement in our
																																																																																						lives, that we would still be living in a jeffersonian nation of small towns,
																																																																																						family farms, and sturdy yeomanry if only the government would get off our
																																																																																						backs. and the only recourse we have against government is the nullification of
																																																																																						state authority. we cling to this misconception like we cling to our guns and
																																																																																						religion. in fact, the myth is inseparable from guns and religion as agents of
																																																																																						thatâ nullification.â  but, ââ¦it is the state and the rule of law than make modern
																																																																																						life possible. its absenceânot its presenceâ âcreates conditions for new cycles
																																																																																						of horrific violence.ââ [31] in america violence has been used to protect âthe american, the southern, the
																																																																																						white protestant, or simply the established middle-class way of life and
																																																																																						morals.â [32] in other words, violence, especially collective violenceâlynching, riots,
																																																																																						vigilantism and the like, upholds tradition. itâs
																																																																																						only when such repressive violence becomes untenable does society turn against
																																																																																						it.[33]oddly,
																																																																																						americans overall have not directed their violent ways against their
																																																																																						government. they raise bloody hell, but with the one glaring exception they
																																																																																						don't rebel against their country. political,
																																																																																						economic, and cultural stability have proven enduring. and hereâs the killer:
																																																																																						violence has been the key to this. quite the opposite of what you would
																																																																																						thinkâthat violence of any sort would be destructive and destabilizingâamerican
																																																																																						violence (most of it, at any rate) has served as a stabilizing force and has
																																																																																						girded our political equilibrium. for most of our history, itâs been a happy
																																																																																						marriage, violence and stability, though the civil war was a particularly nasty
																																																																																						trial separation, and even there the parties reconciled, more or less. â â â â â â â â â â â  an additional irony is that little
																																																																																						of the vast smorgasbord of domestic mayhem has been insurrectionary. our
																																																																																						violence has lacked the sort of anti-government cohesion that might have caused
																																																																																						it to become a sustained political phenomenon. rather it has been local and
																																																																																						largely repressive. while most repressive acts of violence have been
																																																																																						perpetrated by whites against blacks, plenty of whites have died defending
																																																																																						blacks. white mobs frequently lynched and white-capped[34]
																																																																																						white abolitionists. the same protestant mobs that rioted against
																																																																																						irish-catholic immigrants later joined forces with the irish against immigrant
																																																																																						mexicans and chinese.â â â â â â â â â â â  social violence has a strong âconservative biasâ aimed at
																																																																																						preserving the status quo against âabolitionists, catholics, radicals, workers
																																																																																						and labor organizers, negroes, orientals (sic). and other ethnic or racial or
																																																																																						ideological minorities, and has been used ostensibly to protect the americans,
																																																																																						the southern, the white protestant, or simply the established middle-class way
																																																																																						of life and morals.â[35]
																																																																																						âin one way or another,â agrees historian richard maxwell brown, âmuch of our
																																																																																						nineteenth and twentieth century violence has represented the attempt of
																																																																																						established americans to preserve their favored position in the social,
																																																																																						economic, and political order.â[36]
																																																																																						heâs not talking about elites alone. brownâs conclusion is about the established
																																																																																						order of things, which includes the vested interests at all levels of society.
																																																																																						the status quo was the goal, not the enemy. civil violence co-existed with
																																																																																						institutional stability because it supports those institutions. historically,
																																																																																						riots suppressed social, cultural, and racial change. from the majorityâs
																																																																																						perspective, mob action smoothed out societyâs rough edges by containing
																																																																																						challenges to the status quo. for example, violence, especially in the form of
																																																																																						lynch mobs, played a central role in maintaining african americans as ignorant,
																																																																																						impoverished laborers, precisely where the white majority wanted them. white
																																																																																						mobs destroyed with absolute impunity prosperous black businesses and
																																																																																						institutions such as churches, fraternal societies, communities, and on more
																																																																																						than one occasion all-black towns. historian leon litwack tells the story of a
																																																																																						prosperous black georgia farmer who upon driving his new car into the nearby
																																																																																						town was forced by whites to watch helplessly as they poured gas over the car
																																																																																						and incinerated it. that act and the mocking warning that accompanied it
																																																																																						reinforced the racial hierarchy: âfrom now on you niggers walk into town or use
																																																																																						that old mule if you want to stay in this city.â[37] the
																																																																																						history of jim crow in the south is loaded with accounts of prosperous blacks
																																																																																						with nice homes or competitive businesses losing one or even both, and often
																																																																																						their lives. the hatred and stupidity of the white world would be pathetic if
																																																																																						its racism wasnât so downright mean.â â â â â â â â â â â  maybe so. but far more often
																																																																																						violence has been employed to maintain the social fabric. one has but to look
																																																																																						back to historyâs violent counterpoint to see the weakness in this
																																																																																						blame-it-on-the-60s meme.â one of the most violent peacetime decades in
																																																																																						american history was the 1890s. actually, the entire âpeacetimeâ period from
																																																																																						1865 qualifies. but the tumultuous decade that was more red than mauve stands
																																																																																						out.[38] it was filled with riots,
																																																																																						lynchings, vigilantism, gang wars, nativist harassment of immigrants of differing
																																																																																						religions and cultures, and of course the final suppression of the plains
																																																																																						indians.â â â â â â â â â â â â  where were the counterculture and
																																																																																						its âdecadentâ values in all of this? the answer of course is that in many ways
																																																																																						the counterculture would develop partially in response to these sorts of things
																																																																																						(plus, excessive materialism and the existential dilemma of being the first
																																																																																						generation faced with the possibility of being the last generation.â but,
																																																																																						never mind.)â in the gilded age, violence was often a vehicle for stability.
																																																																																						and it was pretty damned effective. those riots, lynchings, white-cappings and
																																																																																						the like were utterly successful in preventing the assimilation into society of
																																																																																						substantial portions of the population, both foreign and native-born. this was
																																																																																						the age of jim crow.â these events, and there were hundreds leaking into
																																																																																						the thousands, were treated as local issues and generally ignored. or, when a
																																																																																						blind eye wasnât possibleâthe 1898 wilmington, north carolina, coup dâetat that
																																																																																						overthrew the legitimately elected, biracial regime in favor of a white one,
																																																																																						for example â the events were cursorily investigated and then ignored. social
																																																																																						violence supported traditional values, in this case white supremacy, in the
																																																																																						face of rapid and often incomprehensible change. traditional values, mind you,
																																																																																						are whatever the populace says they are.â the local populace almost always
																																																																																						sanctioned this violence as being crucial to maintaining social stability. the
																																																																																						legality of their actions was of secondary importance. they argued they had no
																																																																																						choice in the matter. their backs were to the wall. sounds odd, doesnât it, lawlessness
																																																																																						as an agent of stability? sounds like moral relativism, perhaps.â nevertheless,
																																																																																						outsiders and undesirables were contained or excluded, and local society
																																																																																						remained politically and culturally stableâand violent.â â â â â â â â â â â  but first
																																																																																						things first. what do we mean byâ âviolenceâ?
