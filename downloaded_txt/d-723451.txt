what our customers say about us










"i have been a wojo’s shopper for about twenty-five years.  as a lifelong gardener,  it’s always been exciting for me every spring to head to wojo's greenhouse and soak up the marvelous colors and smells, take in the wonderfully grown plant product, as well as check out every year’s improvements in and around the greenhouse."
jean coon






"all wojo's plants, shrubbery, trees and garden art have always been a+ quality. customer satisfaction is superb. but it needs to be said that this is not what constitutes a nice place to shop: it’s the wonderful staff, hard workers, and the great owners. there is often a special event, class to take, or tour for children as well as adults. if you want to feel special, enjoy more color than you can imagine, or smell fragrant flowers that awaken all your senses, then wojos is the place to be. you’ll be glad you came!" 
jan rathburg






“beautiful place. i had lots of fun walking through it and enjoyed the amazing colors of flowers and endless varieties of gorgeous plants. prices are good” 
ganon dorf






“if you want to plant, i’d bet money wojo’s has it! it’s well organized, so if you know what you’re looking for, it can be a quick, easy trip. my favorite thing, though, is to browse the entire place for hours and overload my cart with beautiful, healthy plants. the variety is huge!! they have beautiful planters and pots and other garden accessories. my want list is always bigger than my space and my budget, but putting together a glorious array of flowers and vegetables here is my favorite spring event. plus the staff is friendly and super helpful!”
