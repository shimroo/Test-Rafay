andy and colin believe in continual professional development. since extending colin’s degree in 2010 and following up with advanced ear care courses at aston university in 2011, the practice has expanded to remove ear wax, provide tinnitus advice and management and advise on noise protection issues. we have now added another degree qualified audiologist, alana and a degree qualified ear wax removal specialist karen to the team, who always aim to give clients a complete hearing care package at an affordable price.one of the first things established by honiton hearing centre was a transparent pricing policy, which means that from the outset there are no nasty surprises hidden away.
