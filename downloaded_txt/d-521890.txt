no, sorry, it just makes no sense. rotten individuals scam, so now you set up a claims department for it? um - sure, so similarly if medical insurance companies scam users in us (or sign them off when they would need payments for their ailments), would us government make a medical scams department? dream on (and maybe wait for all these scammers to start to think about it). no, just not going to happen.and if there was such department - you would not be asking the undisclosed-recipients about whether they sent something to this particular account.

free advice: set up an online store (so you don't have to offer these cheque casher 'jobs' anymore)





let me give one free piece of information mister mcieen: most americans don't offer these forms of payment for goods. it is only the folks like yourself who even think about such. why don't you just give them your bank details such as iban and swift, or if you are selling via the internet, set up a working online store? and make up your mind how you want to be called, a mcieen or leem...company representatives is needed (job offer )from: "kine@yahoo.com" to: [my email]dear sir/madam. i hope this email meets you in good health. i feel quite safe dealing with you in this mutual beneficial transaction. though, this medium internet has been greatly abused, i choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest way to get in touch with people. i am mr. kine mcleen and am an artist, i am 40 years old and paint for a living, and have been painting for the past 18 years. i am married with a wife and 2 lovely kids. i have a vacancy opening available in my studio. i am just setting up in the usa and will need a representative to work on a part time basis for me. i sell arts all over the world and have sold to both galleries and private collectors. i am always facing serious difficulties selling my art works to my american clients; most times they offer to pay with either money orders or certified checks which are difficult for me to cash here in united kingdom. i need someone in the states to work as my representative and assist me in processing these payments and i will be willing to pay 10% for every transaction made. first step in this job is for you to wait at home for checks sent by my clients via regular mail or fedex to get to you. for this to be possible i need your basic personal info such as: 1. full name, 2. contact address, 3. city, 4. state, 5. zip code, 6. occupation, 7. phone number, if you are interested in working for me, please kindly send the needed information to my email: kine.leem@gmail.com i await your reply regards kine mcleen note: you are not under any obligation to apply for this post. only sincere and straight forward individuals are needed.x-server-name: www.brindematiere.comx-remote-addr: 41.219.235.22x-script-name: /components/com_expose/expose/img/bug.phpx-virus-scanned: clamav using clamsmtp

another not too personalized nigerian scam





isn't it a bit odd that a ms marina with such an odd sounding first name that if i didn't see her use it as her first name, would have guessed that the lvovska part of her email address would only refer to some l vovska but even that way it sounds too polish, russian or east european to be a kosher thing from africa. and why the marshall.edu address? it maybe helps it pass your spamfilters better but why a lovely lady with such a first name as lvovska who is studying at marshall university, huntington, wv would be involved with such amounts of money?isn't it a bit odd that this lvovska is also sending this to undisclosed recipients? that never means only you.isn't it a bit odd that the people you should be contacting in nigeria have a free email service in uk and ... well, at least that phone number is for a nigerian number.anyone up to calling this fedex courier with a free uk email address (but not a fedex one) and give them what this ms maryna asks for?act fedex courier service (nigeria) for deliveryfrom: "lvovska, maryna"  to: undisclosed-recipientsgreetings.i am lvovska maryna. i have been waiting for you since to contact me for yourconfirmable bank draft of $950.000.00 united states dollars, but i did not hear from you since that time.then i went and deposited the draft with fedex courier service, west africa, i traveled out of thecountry for an asignment and i will not come back till end of febuary 2009.what you have to do now is to contact the fedex courier service as soonas possible to know when they will deliver your package to you because of the expiringdate.for your information, i have paid for the delivering charge, insurancepremium and clearance certificate fee of the cheque showing that it isnot a drug money or meant to sponsor terrorist attack in your country.the only money you will send to the fedex courier service to deliveryour draft direct to your postal address in your country is ($390.00 usd) dollars onlybeing security keeping fee of the courier company so far. again, don't bedeceived by anybody to pay any other money except $390.00 us dollars. i would havepaid that but they said no because they don't know when you will contact them andin case of demurrage.you have to contact the fedex courier service now for the delivery ofyour draft with this information below;contact person: mr.gary albertfedex west africa.e-mail:  fedexdelivery1975@live.co.uktelephone: +234-702-518-8585finally, make sure that you reconfirm the following:(1) full names(2) your postal address(3) and direct telephone numberto avoid any mistake on the delivery and ask them to give you the tracking number immediately you make the payment to themto enable you track your package over there and know when it will get to your address.let me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you receive thismail to avoid any further delay and remember to pay them their securitykeeping fee of $390 us dollars for their immediate action.you should not bother to contact me as i will not be around to check my emails since i am on an asignment till theend of febuary 2009.yours faithfully,lvovska maryna.

aids spam





this is a new category of spam to me. from:  ndxk9@hotmail.com subject:  please help ! -[some random letters and numbers here] date:  july 20, 2008 7:55:40 am ist to:  [some email alias of mine] return-path:  3embb@hotmail.comhonoured ladies and gentlemen,it is not to be turned my kind me on this way to you however the circumstances leave me no other possibility.i want to tell no long stories however i search people to me perhaps help and something support.my name is jim knopf are 45 years and are for 23 years of hiv positive (aids)!now my problem!i need approx. 2500.-euros of every month for drugs.i have lost my health insurance and is not to be raised in the position this sum every month.i can allow to prescribe drugs of the doctor however i must pay this itself.at the moment i live on 210.- euros in the month this is only for food and for the everyday need.i do not need ointments -  oil baths with the low amount are payablemy savings are used up i can raise the money no more.this is why i search people to me, perhaps with small sums can support.every amount is a welcome.i would like to thank for her support!here the online payment systems !!paypal : https://www.paypal.comacc : one-euro@safe-mail.netreference : thank you !---------------------------------------------------------------alertpay: https://www.alertpay.comacc : one-euro@safe-mail.netreference: thank you !------------------------------------------------------------paypay: https://www.paypay.comacc : 8100588105reference : thank you !_____________________________________________bank :bankname : raiffeisenkasse guntramsdorfbankaccount : frank laugwitz iban nummer : at163225000005000641bic/swift : rlnwatwwgtdreference : thank you !!_______________________________________________greeting jim knopfwell well. dear jim knopf, why does your bank account say frank laugwitz?since the bank account you are trying to scam money to is in an austrian bank, i guess we can assume that you are trying to tell people that you are based in austria. how about having a look how their healthcare works?"top spot in europe for austria's health care system: nowhere else in europe are patients treated more quickly and their medical needs better attended to. this has been revealed by a current study in the eu.according to this expert study, austria not only has the most consumer-friendly health care system in europe, but also performs better than countries like switzerland or luxembourg which spend considerably more money on medical care. austria spends 2,186 euros per head per year, luxembourg spends 3,526 euros, switzerland and norway roughly 2,820 euros."even if all health care would not be free in austria, spamming unknown people for scamming money out of them is never ok.oh, and if you are austrian as you claim, why doesn't your bank account name match your name?why are you using an israelian email?and why do you spam unknown people with this fake story, frank (which i don't believe is your name either)? shame on you.

spock.com - another creepy social network





from:   donotreply@spock.comsubject: [a friend's name] has requested your trust on spockdate: december 17, 2007 4:18:21 am gmt+00:00to:  [my email]hi future spocker,[a friend's name] has added you as a trusted contact on spock. by accepting trust, you will be able to search each others’ network, share contact information, and get news.click here to get started. [had some url incorporated to that]-unsubscribe: http://www.spock.com/do/public/request_unsubscribeanother of the series of failures of the social networking attempts, just like pulse plaxo. is it so hard, really?1. do not send me spam. one is enough.2. do not spam the internet and digg about how you will become the google of the people searches. know what? i'm happy to be found using google when i want to. i sign up for my profiles. there is a huge difference in spock or any other creepy failure social network creating automatically a profile for you or me, or we creating them ourselves. i have no control over who they claim i am. and i have zero desire to join spock, or any other spooky network. no, seriously, no, no, no. linkedin, and limited facebook, that's it. no spock, pulse plaxo, hi5, tweety, orkut, schoolfriends, or anything else. no.3. what is it with the unsubscribe? anything that i never subscribed to that is offering me the option to unsubscribe is nothing but spam, irregardless of who sends or appears to have sent it. the spock invites are from people i know, but these basic not understanding how the invites or social networking sites work really creep me out. don't create a profile by any spambot for me, thank you very much. and don't send me any unsubscribe option either.surpise, i am not the only one out there annoyed by spock.com invites.people are considering action against spock.com through can-spam act
