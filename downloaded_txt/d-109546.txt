					testimonials		
		
 













						our doors continue to open within the community, helping us to expand our business and network - but what is truly unique is there seems to be no one size fits all policy for members. the chamber has become a partner to quantgene, adding value in ways we hadn't considered and providing meaningful opportunities seemingly tailored only to our needs.					


fred hullsquantgene 






						santa monica chamber has afforded me the networking infrastructure that i just wouldn’t have found anywhere else. i’m grateful for the enormous lift it provided as i launched my new career in santa monica! 					


sydney sigman insperity 






						in addition to keeping me informed with all aspects of the city, the chamber is a great medium for cultivating relationships with local businesses.

jonathan chuthe independence 






						as a business coach teaching selling/networking, i’m asked a lot about the santa monica chamber. i love sharing that my experience has been outstanding…and i’ve only been a member for a few months. in that short time i have gotten 6 fabulous new clients and referred and connected others that i’ve met at the mixers, speed networking and breakfasts. santa monica chamber = great support, fantastic connections, fun new business!					


laurie hackingstep into more coaching 






						membership in the santa monica chamber of commerce has given me a faster conduit to city hall and has facilitated interfacing with the city manager and city attorney with concerns in my industry as for example when the city passed an ordinance proposing to ban "sandwich signs" denoting open houses in santa monica.					


michael gruningpence hathorn silver - partners trust 






						i've been a member of the santa monica chamber of commerce for over 25 years. it's offered me, as a local businessman, so many outlets to improve and grow my commercial real estate business. there are several informative committees to join to keep you updated on the local scene, educational seminars offered to better market my products and fine tune my business skills, and many other fun social events to mix it up and get better acquainted. i owe my success to this chamber. thank you!

linda "tish" tishermanstaff support, inc. 






						i find that the best benefit is the interaction with business leaders and local government officials to improve the economic environment for our community. i consider my company's chamber membership a contribution to the well being of our city.
