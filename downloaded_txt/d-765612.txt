                        we cordially invite you and a guest to enjoy a complimentary meal and a presentation of our pre-planning seminar.

good things come to those who plan:
the benefits of end-of-life pre-planning
benjamin franklin once said, "by failing
to prepare, you are preparing to fail."
while the phrasing is a bit harsh, the
sentiment certainly holds true to this
day — especially for funeral planning.

did you know there are more than 100
decisions and pieces of information
needed at the time of passing? when
we don't plan ahead, we leave those
decisions to our loved ones — who
might be left to emotionally overspend
or bicker over options.

when we do plan ahead, we protect the
ones we love on the day they'll need it
most. pre-planning not only prevents
uncertainty but provides you and those
you love with the peace of mind of
knowing that things are taken care of.

we'll discuss:
preventing financial burden • documenting your wishes • creating contingency plans

seating is limited!
