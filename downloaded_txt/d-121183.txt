the department of plant pathology at theÂ university of wisconsin â€“ madison was founded in 1910 to meet the needs of the growers and help combat crop failures.

this important relationship between faculty and growersâ€™ needs has continued to be a major strength in our department and in the college of agricultural and life sciences.Â 
current members of the department are dedicated to advancing knowledge of plant-microbe interactions while supporting food production and environmental security by addressing plant disease control, grower and consumer needs, and environmental sustainability.Â 
department personnel have long been recognized for their leadership roles in the biological sciences, and plant pathology in particular:Â 



9
faculty members have served as president of the american phytopathological society.


7
faculty members have been elected into the national academy of sciences.


1
faculty member served as president of the international society for plant pathology.


1
faculty member served as president of the american institute of biological sciences.



the department offers undergraduate, ms and ph.d. degrees in plant pathology.Â

land acknowledgement statement
the university of wisconsin-madison occupies ho-chunk land, a place their nation has called teejop (day-jope) since time immemorial. in an 1832 treaty, the ho-chunk were forced to cede this territory. decades of ethnic cleansing followed when both the federal and state government repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, sought to forcibly remove the ho-chunk from wisconsin.
this history of colonization informs our shared future of collaboration and innovation. today, uw-madison respects the inherent sovereignty of the ho-chunk nation, along with the eleven other first nations of wisconsin.
please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration and settlement that bring us together here today. and please join us in uncovering such truths every day.Â learn more about the departmentâ€™s mission and values.






giving back
whether you are an alumni, parent of a student, or believe in our mission, chances are you share our priorities: providing science-based research, instruction, and extension that supports plant pathology across the state of wisconsin and beyond.
to do that, we rely on the support of our alumni and friends. your generous contribution will help maintain and strengthen current programs and can make a significant difference in the educational experience of students.
support the department
