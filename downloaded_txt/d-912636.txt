	      welcome
	    

at the moment we are only allowed to show  paypal. if thatâs not what you want you can at the moment ring me 01634 221710 and i can take details over the phone. sorry about that this. vivienne.
 orders placed abroad will be subject to postage same as british orders. if you place an order i will then, after weighing your order, send an invoice for the postage. when this is paid i will then dispatch the order.  






biggins table cloth pillow blocks only



this table cloth pillow has 1 x 10â x 10â block and 2 x 10â x 5â blocks. 2 side blocks. the side blocks we have not rounded off. that is up to you if you want to or not. made of ehd polystyrene. this is the strongest polystyrene available. the picture is of how  you make it up. 

  


price: â£12.00  
uk only. courier â£8 , they have to be boxed like a pillow does to protect it. 






laminated patterns

do i need to stick my pattern onto card? cover it with matt film then prick it?

no! you can have your pattern as a matt laminate. ready to prick. when you are very experienced, as i am and many of my customer are, you can not bother to prick it. it is up to you. if you have a laminate which has say 3 bookmarks on it you just cut up your laminate. leaving a bit of a border round each as you do with patterns on pricking card. and yes you can use the pricking again.
most laminates are â£5.75.
you of course get the full paper pattern as well.
itâs changed my lace making life! 




 
we now do a starter kit we can send abroad but without a pillow. you save on a huge postage but get the benefits of our kit. most countries you can buy a pillow locally or may be a friend/ family member has a spare pillow. when you order we will send an invoice for your countryâs postage.



tel: 01634 221710  10am to 6pm. if i am here i will be happy to help you. if its an answering machine leave a message and i will get back to you asp . 
we have a minimum  order of â£7.00 and a minimum postage of â£3.85 . our site has secure payments

how difficult is this pattern?
we now have an image that shows the degree of difficulty for each pattern so you can make your pattern choices with confidence.
in the details for each pattern you will see one of these choices.
        
the more bobbins that are ticked, the more complex the pattern.
but remember most of you have more knowledge than you think.



we are excited to share our first videos! 
you can find all our video tutorials
here.
in our first video, vivienne is showing how to add in a coloured thread as she uses in many of her patterns.


there is a new pattern for you to practice this technique!
multi bookmarks with colour

new!
our second video shows how to work a spider.



next up vivienne uses another of her bookmarks patterns show how to make the flower petals. 



another video showing vivienne making more petals.




no more cutting a needle to fit your pricker! 
new style lace pricker doesnât need the needle cutting down to fit.
vivienne shows how easy it is to replace the needle in our new pattern pricking tool.
