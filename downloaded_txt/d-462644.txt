welcome to 
dick kraft real estate and appraisers 

n.y.s licensed certified appraisers 

when you're looking to buy a new home, there are so many things to consider beyond the sales price: the age and condition of the property, the number of bathrooms, the size of the closets, and if your cars, bikes and all those soccer balls will fit in the garage.
and you may find the perfect house for your family, but did you check out the neighborhood?  is it near schools, parks or work? is it in a flood plain? is an airport nearby?  these factors affect property values.
the house-hunting process raises a lot of questions. you need someone with answers. turn to a qualified, experienced real estate agent: me!
i can guide you to the right home in the right neighborhood and then help you through the purchasing process. through the years, i have developed great relationships with reliable loan officers in our area. they will work to find a loan program that makes sense for you. you could get prequalified, and then we'll have an idea on what is affordable for you.
there's a lot to explore.  if you don't have time to search for a home, call or email me what you're looking for and i'll contact you when they become available.  together, we can make your dreams a reality.  let's get started!


enthusiasm working for you
    helping people make one of their most important decisions is a serious responsibility,
    but something that i enjoy doing. this enthusiasm and hard work will benefit you and
    help reduce the stress and anxiety often associated with real estate transactions.
established credibility
    i have many years of experience and knowledge working in this industry. i can say with
    confidence that i'll get the job done right.
