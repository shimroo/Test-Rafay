the frisch’s sun-fish resort


the frisch’s sun-fish resort is located on lake osakis. lake osakis is rated as one of the top 10 fishing lakes in minnesota and is located just north of i-94 less than 120 miles northwest of the twin cities. we have cabins only, no camp sites nor rv sites. if you are looking for a place to get away from the crowds, this would be the place for you and your family. a wide variety of activities are available in the area in addition to swimming, fishing, and boating. if golf is you game, you will enjoy the many area courses. shop until you drop in the area novelty and antique shops. take a trip on the new area biking/hiking trail. visit some of the area museums. don’t feel like cooking? dine at one of the many local restaurants. you can go to car races or even a drive-in theater. or if you prefer, you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy peaceful times with family and friends. the choice is yours.
