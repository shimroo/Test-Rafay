founded in 1939 as a social and garden club, the hollywood knolls community club (hkcc) is the oldest hillside neighborhood association in los angeles.  we have evolved over the years into a robust community organization representing over 750 households.  we advocate for neighborhood security, fire safety, sound land management, mitigation of traffic congestion and tourism, protection of property values, community beautification, and quality of life.  we believe community solidarity is a powerful engine of progress.each year, we hold an annual membership meeting to elect our all-volunteer board of directors, and to apprise everyone on initiatives to improve life in our community.  we host an annual social event, to convene our current and future members over food and drinks, to strengthen our bonds and celebrate life in this fabulous hollywood hills community.please support us!  every resident of the hollywood knolls, hollywood manor, and lakeridge estates, is encouraged to participate.  it’s easy, just click here: hkcc membership dues, or the membership tab above to join.
