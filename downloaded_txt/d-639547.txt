diabetes and well-being


millions of people with diabetes face daily challenges managing their condition at home, work, and school. they must be resilient, organised, and responsible, impacting both their physical and mental well-being. a new global survey conducted by the international diabetes federation (idf) reveals that 77% of people living with diabetes have experienced anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition because of their diabetes. diabetes care often focuses only on blood sugar, leaving many overwhelmed. this world diabetes day, 14 november, let’s put well-being at the heart of diabetes care and start the change for a better #diabeteslife.
