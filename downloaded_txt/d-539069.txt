aaf seattle is the western washington chapter of the american advertising federation, serving our region's advertising, creative, and communications services community since 1909.



































 



established in 1905, the american advertising federation (aaf) is the only organization that includes members across all disciplines and career levels in advertising. whether you're new to the fast-paced world of advertising or a seasoned professional, the aaf is for you. we're here to help you advance your career, build your connections and celebrate this ever-changing, amazing industry we work in.




events

industry folks may be a lot of fun but they're also professional. so are our regular events, ranging from panels of our industry’s best minds discussing hot topics to casual after-hours mixers where we basically goof off while we network.




membership

as a member of the aaf, you become part of a talented community with access to connections, resources and professional development to help you become and stay successful in the advertising industry.  more than just a club, we’re a bona fide professional association. that kind of thing isn’t just resume material; it builds careers.





the american advertising awards

our local competition recognizes the area’s best of the best - and it’s a pretty great party, too. the winners of these prestigious trophies go on to compete regionally, and the best then vie in the national competition. so yeah, winning an addy is kind of a big deal.
