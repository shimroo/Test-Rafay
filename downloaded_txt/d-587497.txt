metal

the staircase leading to an upper floor of a house or office may have a mundane, unremarkable appearance or be a real work of art. and in this case, a huge role is played by the railing. therefore, it is not enough to determine the type and size of the steps, it is also necessary to choose the appropriate design of the railings.
railings are necessary not only for safety; they also allow you to create a harmonious and holistic interior in the house. unlike some other materials, metal has greater strength and durability. in addition, metal is a very malleable material with which you can create a stunning addition for the stairs. these types of railings are also very easy to manage and clean. metal railings combine very well with wood, glass and other materials present in the interior such as marble, for example. such railings are suitable for many interior styles from classic to modern loft and hi-tech.
we are specialized in designing and installing beautiful openwork railings that do not interfere with the passage of light. our team takes real pride in the work that we do and we strive to create the best railing and staircase design for you.

glass

glass railings for staircases are now becoming more popular in residential homes. these simple, light and sophisticated options perfectly fit almost any interior style: from modern to traditional. despite its simplicity, glass structures can have a rather diverse and interesting design.
it may seem that the glass railing is fragile; however, in fact, such designs are by no means less reliable than any other. with our designs you can confidently rely on glass options. they are excellently suited even for families with children or pets.
even though the railing is very durable, visually it creates a feeling of openness. this design looks elegant and stylish. glass railings give the room a sense of space, light and air. the obvious advantage of glass structures is the fact that its transparency does not interfere with the penetration of sunlight and creates the appearance of an open space.
if wooden or metal railings have the potential to make a small room visually cluttered, transparent railings allow you to expand the space. this is important, especially if the house is small in size and with insufficient lighting. however, glass railings can also suit spacious and bright areas. contact us to today for more information.

design is often viewed as a more rigorous form of art, or art with a clearly defined purpose. the distinction is usually made when someone other than the artist is defining the purpose.

circular stairs

circular staircases not only provide a convenient way to move between floors but also add a spectacular visual feature to your space. the area underneath the staircase can also be used for additional storage. circular stairs are both practical and is an excellent decorative element that can emphasize the architectural style of any room. due to its design features, a circular staircase makes a grand statement and vastly increases the look of an area, especially when located at the entrance.
in addition, round staircases are suitable for buildings and premises of any type and purpose, both residential and commercial. at royal oak railing & stair, we custom tailor our designs for every client’s needs and wishes. take a look at our gallery to see some examples of our work and please don’t hesitate to contact us if have any questions or to discuss design options.

open concept stairs

modern architecture has long promoted visual openness, lightness and simplicity in the design of the interior. open concept stairs correspond to these trends, and can be added both to a minimalist, modern or traditional design. these stairs consist only of treads, that is, the horizontal part, and the distance between them remains free. this creates an atmosphere of lightness, as if the staircase is floating in the air. these stairs are just as functional as any other types of stairs and are absolutely safe to use, in addition to being a beautiful decorative element. a big advantage of open concept stairs is that they won’t split the room into separate enclosed spaces, which is ideal for areas that are small or have limited light coming through.

winder box stairs

winder box stairs are appealing with their original form and design, as well as their compact size. in spaces where a circular staircase would not fit, a winder box staircase can be a great solution.  such a staircase is perfect for a small room, for example, a cottage or as an auxiliary structure, which leads to the attic or basement. having a space efficient design, winder stairs have become a popular choice in both compact and sustainable homes. 
at royal oak railing & stair we make sure that everything is made in accordance with the building code so that your comfort and safety is ensured.  to protect against falls and add to the overall visual effect, high quality railings with handrails are installed, which are available in a variety of materials.
