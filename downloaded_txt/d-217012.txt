proud to partner with the “iloveuguys” foundation to keep schools safer.




see how valcom seamlessly connects all your communications, helping to reduce the trauma of school emergencies.
protecting children is our highest priority.
we’ve installed more than 44,000 k-12 communications systems, including for the los angeles unified school district (lausd), the 2nd largest public school district in the united states. we even direct school districts to available grant money for enhanced emergency response systems. 
for us, it’s more than installing solutions. it’s creating safe and nurturing learning environments for students across the country. after all, we’re parents and grandparents too.
