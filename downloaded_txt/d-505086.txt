testimonials














heidi halverson, eit, restoration science & engineering, llc
“the adam program provided an easily accessible database that our clients were able to use for facility wide management of asbestos.  ecologic was available for helpful support and customization features.  this was just the right fit to meet our client’s asbestos management needs for tracking and maintaining records of the presence and abatement for a large number and a wide variety of asbestos containing buildings.”






bonnie walker, environmental specialist, aurora public schools
“aurora public schools has been using adam to track its asbestos at over 70 sites for more than 10 years.  the best part is being able to have all of the information not only for asbestos, but also for lead and indoor air quality investigations, all in one place.  adam is able to track asbestos bulk sampling results and locations, air sampling results, abatement and o&m activities, inspections, photos, and documents. periodic surveillance and re-inspection reports are quick and easy. ecologic tech support has always been very helpful and responsive and have resolved any issues quickly.”
