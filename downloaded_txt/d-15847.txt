board meetings: the next meeting of the board is january 16, 2025 and will be virtual. board meetings for 2025:  january 16, march 19, may 15, july 17, september 18 and november 20, 2025.
renewal forms:  beginning with the october 1 renewals, renewal applications are now emailed 3-4 months in advance.  two emails are sent from socialwork2@wvsocialworkboard.org: the first informing you that you will receive your renewal by mail and the second is with an attachment, which includes your renewal form. please check your email and spam folder if you have not received your renewal. emails that come back as undeliverable are then mailed a copy of the renwal form.  also, please make sure your email address is current and if you received a recent card asking you to update it, please do so immediately.  
applications and renewals are reviewed and processed within 15 business days following receipt.  please do not email or call the board office to request verfication of receipt or a "status update" before that time, as these calls tend to strain staff resources and delay processing times. if you pay by check, your check will be deposited the day of receipt as per the requirements of the wv state treasurer's office,  regular license renewals and new licenses will be verifiable on our web page once completed (go to license verfication and type in your last name or license number)
important information on renewing your license:  individuals paying by debit card and using ce broker must still return the renewal form to the board; otherwise, staff do not know to process your renewal.  
provisional licensing supervisors:  your annual meeting and progress reports are due in january for all licensees that you supervised in calendar year 2022
