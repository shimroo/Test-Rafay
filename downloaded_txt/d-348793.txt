got kids ??  located on the gulf side of 
        florida, the water conditions are favorable for young children.  
        the gulf of mexico provides a warm inviting "swimming pool" experience.   
        teach your children to swim or just let them splash & wade around in 
		the usually placid shoreline.  
         








never lost in a crowd.  
				a small plastic bucket can provide hours of exploring, shell 
				searching & shark tooth hunting.


shark teeth?




miles of un-crowded private beach for that 
				perfect sunrise or sunset walk.


shells in every color cover the beach.  
				every step can yield a treasure.

    the harbor from venice, north jetty park has a lot to offer. the park lays 
    claim to nearly a thousand feet of wide, breezy beach, bay and gulf access, 
    and excellent fishing from the jetty. at certain time of the year the park 
    is one of the best surfing spots on the gulf of mexico. sarasota county's 
    oldest public beach, nokomis beach encompasses 22 acres of recreation area 
    with a gulf beach that runs for one-third mile. popular with families, the 
    beach has ample free parking, picnic pavilions, a snack bar, and lifeguards.

"shark tooth capital of the 
    world" >>>>>
casey key -- 
	is hunted for teeth regularly, and the teeth 
    do just lay there.  that's why everybody walks the beach with there 
    heads down.  a keen eye and some sunscreen on your neck is all you 
    need. any wave could uncover a trophy......you just need to be there first.
	the mighty megalodon, the largest carnivorous shark to 
    ever prowl the seas, was over 60 feet in length. precursor to the modern 
    great white shark lived in the miocene epoch 5 to 24 million years ago. some 
    of the larger teeth fetch prices to $5000 and more!

shark teeth ?!?!?!   click it.
