welcome to my
ahcuah
website.


i'm interested in a bunch of stuff,
so you will find an odd mix of things here.


i do a lot of hiking (always barefoot) in southeastern ohio,
and i've always really enjoyed maps. that has led to my mapping
the trails in the places i hike, using as a base the topological maps from
libremaps.
my hiking maps can be found
here.


i prefer to go barefoot, to the point that i am always willing
to challenge the status quo. i have an eclectic collection
of resources about barefooting here.


going barefoot had led me to learning a lot about the law, and that
led to a few lawsuits that i have filed (and, so far, lost) regarding
a right to go barefoot. it also led to another situation in which i
was able to leverage that legal experience when my son got a ticket
and was punished beyond what the law allowed (i won that one).
the dockets and documents (legal briefs, judgment entries) for those
cases are
here.


finally, i write a blog
on wordpress. many of the
entries are related to barefooting, but i also include information
on hiking (mostly in southeastern ohio) and my observations of nature.
maybe some day i'll expand to politics.
