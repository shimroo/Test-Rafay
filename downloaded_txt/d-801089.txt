nitric oxide.
the “perpetual pump.” cell-signaling vasodilators. you’ve heard about
it, now it’s time to add it to your training program. what is vasodilation? in plain english, it’s when blood vessels dilate or
relax. when blood vessels relax, they widen. nitric oxide (no) is the
key here. no is an important endogenous pulmonary vasodilator. as a
vasodilator, nitric oxide has the ability to increase your body’s
ability to deliver blood to working muscles. more blood means more
oxygen and nutrients that are being pumped into skeletal muscles. all this translates into
bigger, fuller pumps and better overall gains. in fact, with no, you
can expect increased muscle size, strength, endurance, and quicker
recovery times.  





great tasting bar and has no chocolate
      coating, (peanut and coconut only). personally i like the crunchy peanuts in the peanut flavored bar. it has 30 plus grams of protein with a soft chewy nougat and rich creamy
      caramel. this protein bar tastes as good as or better then any candy bar ive ever used plus it can be used as a meal replacement or
      snack. truth bar by

      stomachs. hoodia 1500 ex by scifit nutrition

relieve the harmful effect of stress on your
      body. phosphatidyl serine complex by natures way contains phospholipid nutrients and fatty acids that help to suppress cortisol naturally. phosphatidyl serine is also said to help prevent brain aging and improve cell and nerve functions that declined with aging. excess cortisol (stress hormone) may break down your hard earned muscle and increase fat accumulation, lowers immune response, making it easier to get sick. it also breaks down muscle tissue. when cortisol levels get too high, you get weaker, sick or over-trained.

healthier
      than olive oil. while olive oil is better than most because of
      its 70% monounsaturated fat content, macadamia oil is even richer with
      80%. a problem with olive oil is its instability. it deteriorates at room
      temperature and bums at 350'f (which is lower than temperatures used in
      baking and sauteing). conversely, macadamia oil remains stable at room
      temperature, does not require refrigeration, and won't bum in cooking
      temperatures ranging up to 450'f. 
      ideal
      for low carb diets. endorsed as part of the hamptons diet and by dr.
      fred pescatore, who recommends that his patients take one tablespoon per
      day. 
tastes
      great.
same
      buttery taste as the nuts, which makes it a better choice than olive oil
      for cooking omelets, stir-frying and using in salad dressings. macnut oil from nature's way
