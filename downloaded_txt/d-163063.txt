craig camera: world source for photographic manuals





i want to thank all our loyal customers. but i am sorry the time has come for me to close down craig camera and will do something more fitting to preserve my husbandâs memory in the field of photographic history. instead, i will finally fulfill my commitment to those in the daguerreian society, and those who collect american daguerreotypes and will finish the third edition of craigâs daguerreian registry. 
for your instruction manual needs kindly contact our friends and colleagues at http://www.oldtimercameras.com/craigcamera/
if you are interested in purchasing the entire instruction manual and branded literature i am offering it for $125,000. you can contact me at craigcamera@outlook.com. 
i will be taking down the website by the end of march
