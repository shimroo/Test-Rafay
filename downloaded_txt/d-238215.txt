                        fart name list





the 
                        alarm fart -  this is a good fart for the beginner. 
                        it is easy to identify. it starts with a loud unnaturally 
                        high note, wavers like a siren, and ends with a quick 
                        downward note that stops before you expect it to. it sounds 
                        like something is wrong. if it happens to you, you will 
                        know right off why it is called the alarm fart. you will 
                        be alarmed. the alarm fart however is rare.

                        the amplified fart -  this is any fart that gets its 
                        power more from being amplified than from the fart itself. 
                        a metal porch swing will amplify a fart every time. so 
                        will a plywood table,and empty fifty gallon drum, a tin 
                        roof, or some empty cardboard boxes if they are strong 
                        through being amplified in this way can be called an amplified 
                        fart. these are common farts under the right conditions. for example, if 


 you're sitting on an empty 55-gallon steel drum. 

                        the anticipated fart -  this one warns that it is 
                        back there waiting for some time before it arrives. a 
                        person who is uneasy for a time in a crowd and who later 
                        farts at a time when they think no one will notice has 
                        farted an anticipated fart. 
the 
                        back seat fart -  this is a fart that occurs only 
                        in automobiles. it is identified chiefly by odor. the 
                        back seat fart can usually be concealed by traffic noise 
                        as it is an eased-out fart and not very loud. but its 
                        foul odor will give it away, due to the way air moves 
                        around in a car. it is often followed by someone saying, 
                        "who farted in the back seat?" 
the 
                        barn owl fart -  a familiarity with owl calls is helpful 
                        in identifying this fart. almost any morning if you get 
                        up just before daybreak you can hear one of these birds 
                        talking to himself. it's a sort of a crazy laugh, particularly 
                        the way it ends. if you hear a fart that has about eight 
                        notes in it, ending on a couple of down notes, and it 
                        sounds maniacal, you have heard the rare barn owl fart. 
                        

the bathtub fart -  people who would never in their 
                        life know one fart from another, who would like to act 
                        like fart don't exist, will have to admit that a bathtub 
                        fart is something special. it is the only fart you can 
                        see! what you see is the bubbles. the bathtub fart can 
                        be either single or multiple noted and fair or foul as 
                        to odor. it makes no difference. the farter's location 
                        is what does it. maybe there is a kind of muffled pong 
                        and one big bubble. or there may be a ping ping ping and 
                        a bunch of bubbles. the sound i should point out depends 
                        somewhat on the depth of the water, and even more on the 
                        tub. if it is one of those big old heavy tubs with the 
                        funny legs you can get terrific sound effects. while one 
                        of the new thin ones half buried in the floor can be disappointing.

the biggest fart in the world fart -  like the 
                        great bald eagle, this fart is pretty well described just 
                        by its name. this can either be a group one or a group 
                        two fart and can occur just about anywhere. i heard it 
                        one time, a group two identification, in a crowded high 
                        school auditorium one night, right in that silence that 
                        happens when a room full of people has stopped singing 
                        the star spangled banner and sat down. it came from the 
                        back. there was not a soul in that room that missed it. 
                        a fart like that can be impressive. the most diagnostic 
                        characteristic of the biggest fart in the world is it 
                        size.fart freaks who go around showing off, farting like 
                        popcorn machines, and making faces before they fart or 
                        asking you to pull their finger and then they fart, never 
                        have what it takes for this one, which is rare even among 
                        your most serious farter's.

the bitburr: sounds like just that--you're walking and the initial explosion "bit!--" during one step is followed by a more gentle release of the rest of the volume during the next step: "brrrrrr..." 
the 
                        bullet fart -  its single and most pronounced diagnostic 
                        characteristic is its sound. it sounds like a rifle shot. 
                        the farter can be said to have snapped it off. it can 
                        startle spectators and farter alike. fairly common following 
                        the eating of the more common fart foods, such as beans. 
                        

the burning brakes fart -  a silent fart identified 
                        by odor alone. usually and adult fart, occurring while 
                        the adult is driving a car or has a front seat passenger 
                        who farts. the burning brakes fart actually does smell 
                        a little like burning brakes, and seems to hang around 
                        longer than most farts which gives whoever farted a chance 
                        to make a big show of checking to see if the emergency 
                        brake has been left on. when he finds it hasn't you know 
                        who farted. a common automobile fart.

the car door fart -  either a group one or a group 
                        two fart. very tricky. it is meant to be a concealed fart. 
                        a matter of close timing is involved, the farter trying 
                        to fart at the exact moment he slams the car door shut. 
                        it is usually a good loud fart. it is one of the funnier 
                        farts when it doesn't work, which is almost every time. 
                        it is a desperation fart and not too common.

the celestial fart -  not to be confused with the 
                        did an angel speak fart, which is simply any loud fart 
                        in church. the celestial fart is soft and delicate, surprising 
                        in a boy or an adult. it is probably the most shy of all 
                        farts and might be compared with the wood thrush, a very 
                        shy bird. it does not have the sly or cunning sound of 
                        the whisper fart. it is just a very small clear fart with 
                        no odor at all. very rare.

the chicken soup fart: one day i had chicken soup for lunch at work and then stopped off at the gym after work. when it came on, i eased it out, covered by the gym's muzak. it smelled exactly like chicken soup. a few feet away some woman sniffed and said; "is somebody cooking?" i had to turn to the wall to hide my laughter. 

the chinese firecracker fart -  this is an exceptional 
                        multiple noted fart identified by the number, and variety 
                        of its noises, mostly pops and bangs. often when you think 
                        it is all over, it still has a few pops and bangs to go. 
                        in friendly company this one can get applause. uncommon. 
                        
the 
                        command fart -  this fart differs from the anticipated 
                        fart in that it can be held for long periods of time waiting 
                        for the right moment. unlike the anticipated fart, it 
                        is intended to be noticed. harold tabor recently held 
                        a command fart for the whole period in history class and 
                        let it go right at the end when the teacher asked if there 
                        were any questions. 
the 
                        common fart -  this fart needs little description. 
                        it is to the world of farts what the house sparrow is 
                        to the world of birds. i can see no point in describing 
                        this far any further. 

the crowd fart -  the crowd fart is distinguished 
                        by its very potent odor, strong enough to make quite a 
                        few people look around. the trick here is not to identify 
                        the fart but the farter. this is almost impossible unless 
                        the farter panics, and starts a fit of coughing or starts 
                        staring at the ceiling or the sky as though something 
                        up there fascinates him. in which case he is the one. 
                        very common. 
the 
                        cushioned fart -  a concealed fart, sometimes successful. 
                        the farter is usually on the fat side, sometimes a girl. 
                        they will squirm and push their butt way down into the 
                        cushions of a sofa or over-stuffed chair and ease-out 
                        a fart very carefully without moving then or for some 
                        time after. some odor may escape, but usually not much. 
                        common with some people. 

the did an angel speak fart -  this is any loud 
                        fart in church. this fart was first called to my attention 
                        by my father. he probably read about it somewhere. for 
                        fart watchers who go to church, this is a good one to 
                        watch for as this is the only place it can be found.
the 
                        dud fart -  the dud fart is not really a fart at all. 
                        it's a fart that fails. for this reason it is strictly 
                        a group one identification fart, because there is no real 
                        way you can identify a fart that somebody else expected 
                        to fart but didn't. it is the most private of all farts. 
                        in most cases the farter usually feels a little disappointed. 
                        
the 
                        echo fart -  this is a fart that can be wrongly identified. 
                        it is not some great loud fart in an empty gym or on the 
                        rim of the grand canyon. the true echo fart is a fart 
                        that makes its own echo. it is a two-toned fart, the first 
                        tone loud, then a pause, and then the second tone. like 
                        an echo. 
the 
                        g and l fart -  this is one of the most ordinary and 
                        pedestrian of farts, known to everyone. certainly it is 
                        the least gross. if you have not already guessed, g and 
                        l stands for gambled and lost. one of the most embarrassing 
                        of all farts, even when you are alone. 
the 
                        ghost fart -  a doubtful fart in most cases, as it 
                        is supposed to be identified by odor alone and to occur, 
                        for instance, in an empty house. you enter and smell a 
                        fart, yet no one is there. people will insist that only 
                        a fart could have that odor, but some believe it is just 
                        something that happens to smell like a fart. 
the 
                        hic-hachoo-fart fart -  this is strictly an old lady's 
                        fart. what happens is that the person manages to hiccough, 
                        sneeze, and fart all at the same time. after an old lady 
                        farts a hic-hachoo-fart fart she will usually pat her 
                        chest and say, "my, oh my," or "well, well." 
                        there is no reason she should not be proud, as this is 
                        probably as neat an old person's fart as there is. 
the 
                        jerk fart -  the jerk fart is a fart by a jerk who 
                        smirks, smiles, grins, and points to himself in case you 
                        missed it. it is usually a single-noted, off-key, fading 
                        away, sort of whistle fart, altogether pitiful, but the 
                        jerk will act as if he has just farted the biggest fart 
                        in the world fart. 
the 
                        john fart -  the john fart is simply any ordinary 
                        fart farted on the john. it is naturally a group one identification, 
                        with the sound, whatever it was, somewhat muffled. if 
                        it is all the person's trip to the john amounted to he 
                        will be disappointed for sure. common as pigeons. 
the 
                        lead fart -  the heaviest of all farts. it sounds 
                        like a dropped ripe watermelon. or a falling body in some 
                        cases. it is the only fart that goes thud. except for 
                        the odor, which is also very heavy, it could be missed 
                        altogether as a fart. what was that, you might think? 
                        and never guess. 
the 
                        malted milk ball fart -  odor alone is diagnostic 
                        and positively identifies this fart. it smells exactly 
                        like malted milk balls. no other food works this way. 
                        it is rare. 
the 
                        oh my god fart -  this is the most awful and 
                        dreadful stinking of all farts - a fart that smells like 
                        a month-old rotten egg - as the oh my god fart. if you 
                        should ever encounter it, however, you may first want 
                        to say, oh sh*t, which would be understandable. 
the 
                        omen fart -  this is the adult version of the poo-poo 
                        fart. about the only difference is that the farter will 
                        not say anything. he will just look kind of funny and 
                        head for the john. this one is easy to spot if you pay 
                        attention. 
the 
                        organic fart -  sometimes called the health food nut 
                        fart. the person who farts an organic fart may be talking 
                        about the healthy food he eats even when he farts. if 
                        he is heavily into health foods he may even ask if you 
                        noticed how good and pure and healthy his fart smells. 
                        it may smell to you like any other fart, but there is 
                        no harm in agreeing with him. he is doing what he thinks 
                        is best. 
the 
                        quiver fart -  a group one identification fart only. 
                        when you fart, it quivers. if it tickles, then it is the 
                        tickle fart. if you have to scratch it, then it is the 
                        scratchass fart. 
the 
                        rambling phaduka fart -  you must not be fooled by 
                        its pretty-sounding name, as this is one of the most frightening 
                        of all farts. it is frightening to farter and spectator 
                        alike. it has a sound of pain to it. what is most diagnostic 
                        about it, however, is its length. it is the longest-lasting 
                        fart there is. it will sometimes leave the farter unable 
                        to speak. as though he has had the wind knocked out of 
                        him. a strong, loud, wavering fart, it goes on for at 
                        least fifteen seconds. 
the 
                        relief fart -  sound or odor don't matter on this 
                        one. what matters is the tremendous sense of relief that 
                        you have finally farted. some people will even say, "wow, 
                        what a relief." very common. 
the 
                        reluctant fart -  this is probably one of the oldest 
                        farts known to man. the reluctant fart is a fart that 
                        seems to have a mind of its own. it gives the impression 
                        that it likes staying where it is. it will come when it 
                        is ready, not before. this can take half-a-day in some 
                        instances. 
the 
                        rusty gate fart -  the sound of this fart seems almost 
                        impossible for a fart. is is the most dry and squeaky 
                        sound a fart can make. the rusty gate fart sounds as if 
                        it would have worked a lot easier if it had been oiled. 
                        it sounds like a fart that hurts. 
the 
                        s.b.d. fart -  s.b.d. stands for silent but deadly. 
                        this is no doubt one of the most common farts that exists. 
                        no problem of identification with this one. 
the 
                        sandpaper fart -  this one scratches. otherwise it 
                        may not amount to much. you should remember that if you 
                        reach back and scratch, it automatically becomes a scratchass 
                        fart. common.

the shower fart: these are a lot worse than bathtub farts, due to conditions of humidity and heat. george carlin once said that you can tolerate the smell of your own farts, but shower farts are the exception to that rule.                        
the 
                        skillsaw fart -  a truly awesome fart. it vibrates 
                        the farter. really shakes him up. people back away. it 
                        sounds like an electric skillsaw ripping through a piece 
                        of half-inch plywood. very impressive. not too common. 

the snart: this is a fart that you succeed in suppressing so as not to not to offend, but then a sneeze jars it loose.                        
the 
                        sonic boom fart -  the people who believe in this 
                        fart claim it is even bigger than the biggest fart in 
                        the world fart. the sonic boom fart is supposed to shake 
                        the house and rattle the windows. this is ridiculous. 
                        no fart in the world shakes houses and rattles windows. 
                        a fart that could do that would put the farter into orbit 
                        or blow his crazy head off. 
the 
                        splatter fart -  unfortunately the splatter fart exists. 
                        it is the wettest of all farts. it probably should not 
                        be called a fart at all. 
the 
                        stutter fart -  if you think stuttering is funny, 
                        this is a very funny fart. it is a fart that can't seem 
                        to get going. the sound is best described as pt,pt,pt-pt,pt-pt-pt,pop,pop-pop-pop-pow! 
                        it is usually a forced-out fart that gets caught crossways, 
                        as they say, and only gets farted after considerable effort. 
                        
the 
                        taco bell fart -  the taco bell fart is far richer 
                        and full-bodied than your ordinary junk fart and takes 
                        longer to build up. sometimes hours or even a day. but 
                        it will get there. and it will hang around after, too. 
                        even on a windy day. 
the 
                        teflon fart -  slips out without a sound and no strain 
                        at all. a very good fart in situations where you would 
                        rather not fart at all. you can be talking to someone 
                        and not miss saying a word. if the wind is right he will 
                        never know. 
the 
                        thank god i'm alone fart -  everyone knows this rotten 
                        fart. you look around after you have farted and say, "thank 
                        god i'm alone." then you get out of there fast! 
the 
                        tickle fart -  a group one only and one of the easiest 
                        to identify. usually a slow soft sort of fart. if you 
                        like being tickled this is the fart for you!
the 
                        unconscious fart -  my friend is asleep and snoring and they let out a couple of farts without know it.
