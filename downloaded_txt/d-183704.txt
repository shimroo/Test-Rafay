guinea pig tv: special photography episode
april 8th, 2008 · 2 comments

it’s been busy here – and even the pets have been busy, creating a new episode of guinea pig tv, this one inspired by ted’s passion for photography. chatterboy is nearing retirement, so truffles came to live with us soon after her birth on christmas eve. this new video includes three cavies: chatterboy, truffles and truffles mother, pearl, in a guest-star cameo role. abigail did the writing and camera work for this episode.
   
thanks to ted leung, chase jarvis and strobist.com for inspiration…
oh  yeah, and the strobist commercial 2.0 too…
