tisch online high school filmmakers workshop












"many things felt remarkable about the workshop to me but the one that meant the most was the ability to receive feedback from professors. i have taken a media arts class every year in high school and have never been able to develop the way i did well at nyu ever before. working with well-versed professors felt invaluable to me."
