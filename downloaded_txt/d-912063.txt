is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and
hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help
others to recover from alcoholism. the only requirement for membership
is a desire to stop drinking. there are no dues or fees for a.a. membership;
we are self-supporting through our own contributions.  a.a. is not allied
with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does
not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any
causes.  our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics
to achieve sobriety."
