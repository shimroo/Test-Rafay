	 pantone unveils the top 10 colors for spring 2007
	 
    


the spring 2007 runways will radiate with surprising neutrals and innovative splashes of corals, yellows and purples, reports pantone,inc., the global authority on color and provider of professional color standards for the design industries.  each season, pantone surveys the designers showing at new york fashion week to collect feedback on prominent collection colors, color inspiration, color philosophy and each designer's signature shade. this information is used to create the pantone fashion color report and serves as a reference tool throughout the year for fashion enthusiasts, reporters and retailers.  the top 10 most directional women's ready-to-wear colors for spring 2007 (along with printing values) are:  pantone 12-1206 silver peony c=3 m=13 y=15 k=0 pantone 15-0326 tarragon c=37 m=7 y=60 k=0 pantone 16-3801 opal gray c=34 m=21 y=28 k=0 pantone 14-1041 golden apricot c=8 m=26 y=70 k=0 pantone 19-2924 hollyhock c=55 m=97 y=14 k=3 pantone 13-0648 green sheen c=13 m=5 y=72 k=0 pantone 16-3929 grapemist c=57 m=28 y=1 k=0 pantone 16-1220 café crème c=19 m=38 y=45 k=5 pantone 16-1720 strawberry ice c=1 m=56 y=29 k=0 pantone 14-4318 sky blue c=45 m=9 y=8 k=0  "most often, colors are not completely reinvented each season," observes leatrice eiseman, executive director of the pantone color institute. "instead, they evolve from one season to the next. the apple cinnamon of fall, for example, becomes the café crème of spring. what does change each season is the variation of the colors, and/or thecombinations of colors. while navy, black and white are still a presence for spring 2007, designers are choosing a greater variety of neutrals as the canvas for this season's captivating new hues."  the colors featured in the pantone fashion color report are based on the pantone for fashion and home color system, the most widely used and recognized color standard in the world. the pantone fashion color report spring 2007 is available online at http://www.pantone.com/spring2007.
