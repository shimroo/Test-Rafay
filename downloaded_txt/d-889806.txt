Â Â they know what they are doing, and repair cost was reasonable.

Â Â the man who helped me went above and beyond contiining to take his time explaining things to me and being very helpful.

other computer repair shops wonâ€™t even take the time to simply talk about whats going on with your computer until they can start charging you! while these guys looked at it for a few minutes, discussed things with me and showed they cared and truly wanted to help me with my issue. then when they started working they went straight into it as to not just dilly dally around to charge me for more time.

thanks again pro computer inc! definitely the best computer repair shop in the northern area around roy, ogden, layton etc!
