who we are:

                dynea is an independent company, owned in full by private
                norwegian investors & management. total turnover was approx. 1,7
                mrd. nok (150 mill. ) in 2023, and we sold approximately 142
                000 mt of products.
              

                dynea employs around 220 dedicated adhesive professionals. we
                can look back on a long history, dating back to 1947. until
                2000, the company was part of the listed industrial group dyno,
                where it constituted the group's chemical business area. in
                2000, the company became part of the newly formed dynea group
                where the resins and adhesives activities of dyno, neste
                chemicals and perstorp were merged. the dynea group was
                dismantled and divested in parts from 2007 to 2013, when the
                current dynea was created and sold to eltek holding in norway.
              
where we are going:

                our ambition is to build on our existing strong platform growing
                and further strengthening our position as a market leader and
                winning company, preferred for our innovative solutions. we aim
                to lead the way in our field and help our customers grow their
                businesses in a sustainable way. through continuous innovation
                and improvement, we hope our activity will stimulate more use of
                wood in construction, and thus enhance the world's capacity to
                safely store co2.
