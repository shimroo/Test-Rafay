who we arewe are a group of jewish people and gentiles who have come to believe that jesus of nazareth is the messiah of israel and saviour of the world. through jesus (yeshua), we enjoy the blessings of the new covenant that god promised to the house of israel and the house of judah (jeremiah 31:31-34). through him, god's torah has been written on our hearts, our sins have been forgiven and we know the god of avraham, yitzak and ya'acov as our god and father.
