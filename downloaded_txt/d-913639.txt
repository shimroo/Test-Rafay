health care that is ignored

               my husband pays top dollar for our health coverage. but, my son who is 14 , recently needed a couple of cavaties addressed and filled. the co-pay, was over 500$ for 3 small fillings. i know for us that was a shock considerning our insurance is suposed to cover 2 fillings per year. and we had definatly been mis quoted by the dentists office, being told that our percentage of payment would be 160$,  how can anyone afford dental care with these outrageous co-pays for dental? most medical dental ...

how prepared for the future are you ?

               any way you slice it, poo is being slung into the proverbial fan. terrorists are going to strike, after the next natural disaster but before the flu pandemic, and not before oil prices ratchet up another notch. yet it seems most of the latchkey generation of entitlement, is living off both their credit cards and the belief that someone else will plan ahead.. for whatever.       seriously, how many people do you actually know who have more in their "pandemic kit" than fresh ipod batteries? ho...

              your home is being compiled onto a government tracking database.!   it is if you own any livestock .  do you have one horse? one chicken?   the nais is a national id center that will affect you.   even if you do not have any livestock animals it will affect your  choices. do you like organic foods? how much ?  do you like lower food prices? how much ??? do you like being put onto a database without your permission?  you may already have been !  the nais is a program the usda doe...

the us surveilence points to the small farm

            melissa176


               the usda and "powers that be",  including the following companies , (its long so i will attach it to the bottom of this message )  all stand to gain in one way or another  by the new rules the usda has decided to enact upon the us. rules and regulations that are in violation of civil liberties.  (but not to worry the usda has seen the error of its own wording and is changing the format , but not the content) and is in the processes of enacting surveillance of all of the nations livestock. al...

               not a good idea, to mandate gps tracking on all livestock , and the usda wants also to open end the ideas of retinal scanning or dna typing . for big beef industry and specific electronics divisions. both will get a hefty boost without small farms to  keep them working a little bit harder. they claim the national tracking is to prevent disease outbreaks but the us has ok'ed the import of chickens from china.. where the bird flu currently actually is. government wants small farmers, and yes th...

more government involvement

            january 16, 2006 by
            melissa176


               soon government wants to  put tracking chips in my livestock . they want to track every move my horses and lambs make. they want me to pay for them to spy on me. they want to make my animals un-kosher thereby unavailable to some of my buyers. they want my kids to pay to show lambs at the state fair. nc is not on the ball at all about nais a soon to be mandatory program for all livestock owners. including poultry and hogs, sheep, goats, alpacas,llamas,horses, .. all of them .. why ? so they ca...

               first , so you know where i get my information and credibility from, i am a handspinner, and raise sheep,.i specificly raise sheep for high quality wool. most people who believe they are allergic to wool really are not. they are in fact allergic to weither the processing, the dye, the cleansing agents, or some other process that happens in large scale manufacturing. the chemical make up of real wool, is so similar to human hair, if your allergic to wool, you are likely also allergic to your o...

a new life coming for all?

            melissa176


               imho, more than most people are ready to make. the way the world, and in particular, how this country works, we are in for some seriously hard times. the gas prices affect everything and while in comparison to bottled water gas is cheap, it affects more things than bottled water does. soon we will see grocery prices edging upward, because they cost more to get to the store, or electricity costs in the factrory or the paint on the label is petroleum based.. or all of the above , and the prices...

               3 kids, one actually old enough to need to write an essay about "liberty" and freedom... and another, who wont remember what those words really meant... kindof like when my daughter had no idea of who john wayne was, and asked me if i was alive when the titanic sank.. my toddler instead of asking about records... will ask about freedom of speech... before the draft, the right to bear arms and many other civil liberties noone seems to remember anymore. now with 2 impending supreme seats openin...

what if

            melissa176


               what if ???  (and i am being non specific on party affiliation on purpose, )  lets say a politician were to stand up and say, " regardless of religion, race belief , my job is to defend your right to believe what you wish, support the god of your choice, pray how you want, sing the songs you want, watch the television you want, vote how you want and , if you have the votes to change the law, marry who you want. it is not my job to tell you how to believe or who to believe in, it is my job to ...

               ok, married mom not heavily religious, thinks religion and politics need to be kept seperate, also think noone should be able to tell me when or how religious i need to be, i do believe in teaching my kids to have good morals and be totally responsible for thier actions, as well as thier work load. i dont believe in laziness, and lies... i have friends of several different religious beliefs, and none is superior to another, i think my ex husband is a deadbeat, and can afford a laywer to try t...

a day on the farm

            melissa176


               lots to learn, farming on small scale, hard to save money this way too, but it is the main plan. it is like a contest for myself, with the electric bill as the final test. as i get better at cutting corners, i can see it there. and heck with gas prices going up the way they are, it cant hurt for me to engage in that kind of self contest. garden is in, veggies are planted,sheep are all shorn , and now we are hearing about the scares with livestock and children.. break out the bleach for horse ...

               american wool needs you. acrylic yarns for all you crafters, are made from petroleum products. wools are not and there are some super soft fibers out there, and an underground movement of artists, creating unique works of art with all natural fibers . there are new fibers too , all natural newbies to add shine a silkieness, a softness, etc. and the standbys are easier for you to get from hand spinners too , cashmere? mohair? angora? and then you have some very eclectic naturally colored wools...

               everyone villifies and condemns michael schiavo , i applaud him !!! what does he really have to gain by standing up to the militant right to life movement? he has moved on, he has a new family yet he did all in his power to keep his word...  how come noone can see maybe, he did deeply love his wife, mounned the loss of her a few years ago, but noone publicly was around then... he might have come to terms, bt set his mind to keeping his promise to his wife that he had loved probably deeply!.....
