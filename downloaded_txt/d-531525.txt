“never forgotten”the families of homicide victims and missing persons uses public and private cooperation to seek justice for their loved ones, taken too soon, with no conviction or resolution for their loss. our motto is “never forgotten” and our m.o. is “resolution through communication”. our national unresolved homicides database is used by family and law enforcement to gain new insights and information into unsolved murders and abductions. we are proud of the work we do.
