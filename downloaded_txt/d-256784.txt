    “blessed are they who mourn” … “blessed are they who are persecuted” … “blessed are they who are hated, who are persecuted, hungry or weeping.”     wait! the beatitudes don’t make sense! i don’t want to be persecuted or hungry or poor; no one looks forward to such desperate times in our lives.     unless we realize that we are using the wrong yardstick for measuring success. what we are actually receiving in jesus’ teaching today gives us a new measurement of success, simply contained in the word hope. the responsorial psalm is perhaps a key to unlocking the depth of jesus’ preaching, when is exclaims with joy, “blessed are they who hope in the lord!”     the jerusalem bible, another authentic catholic translation of the scriptures presents this psalm in very clear but challenging terms: “blessed the one who has places all trust in the lord, and has not gone over to the proud who follow false gods.”     so now the real challenge we must consider this week is this: am i the one – or one of the many – who places all trust in the lord?  i hope so, i like to think that describes me, but i also know that sometimes that is not true.  we all have moments of human despair; we all have times when we feel the glory of success and think – even briefly – that it was i who accomplished that goal, that milestone, that special project.     but what if we intentionally chose a different, path, one where we take joy in being dependent upon god’s goodness. when pope francis declared 2025 as a jubilee year, he dedicated the year to the theme that we are all “pilgrims of hope,” and asked in his prayer that god “… reawaken in us the blessed hope for the coming of your kingdom.”    beginning this weekend, and continuing throughout the jubilee year, we will recite the jubilee prayer composed by pope francis each weekend at our masses.  may that prayer serve as a constant reminder that we call upon god most high to fill us with the grace to become, every day and at every moment, true pilgrims of hope.  as we pray each week for ourselves and those around us, may god’s “… grace transform us into tireless cultivators of the seeds of the gospel.”    may we truly, each day, be the blessed who hope and trust in the lord!     - father jim
