helen’s hope chestin 2009, arizona foster families experienced a 50% reduction in basic needs financial assistance as well as an influx of children in need of their care. difficult financial conditions on a national scale and the high cost of caring for children forced many families to foster fewer children or to close their doors to new placements entirely. helen’s hope chest was created to reduce the financial burden on foster and kinship families while creating a safe, welcoming, and dignified space for the children in their care. for more information, click here.
















azura literacy(formerly “12 books”)azura literacy was started in 2014 as an initiative to improve literacy among elementary students in mesa by distributing free books for summer reading. since its inception, the program has expanded the free distributions in title i schools and has started a free reading mentor program for students struggling with literacy. azura literacy strives to give disadvantaged children a greater chance to succeed. for more information, click here.
