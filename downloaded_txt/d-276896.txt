welcome toballet californiaballet california's mission is to be the nation's leading pre-professional ballet company, already a leader on the west coast, providing unparalleled training to our youth as well as performances that inspire and enrich the community. continuing in the rich tradition of south bay ballet and lauridsen ballet centre, founded in 1978, our dancers experience a real company atmosphere along with performance opportunities that mirror the professional world. our proven success in consistently placing dancers in professional contracts has earned us the respect of the international ballet community and a legacy of creating future leaders in the arts. our training instills self-discipline, teamwork, perseverance, respect, self-confidence and dedication to excellence.ballet california performances encourage a life-long love of the arts. each year we offer a diverse range of ballets, from classical to contemporary. in addition to "the nutcracker", our annual season includes both the eclectic "bravo!" concert and our storybook ballet, as well as our benefactors' concert hosted at our landmark studio. each performance also offers the community an opportunity to engage in the arts and demonstrate the value of dance, where artistry, athleticism, and transformation reside.

“my training with diane lauridsen has been invaluable. i have been blessed enough to be gifted with her vast knowledge and experience in the field of dance. she has guided my training and ultimately my career with skill, but also compassionate love. i truly believe, if not for lauridsen ballet centre, i might not be living my dream as a dancer with american ballet theatre today.”
