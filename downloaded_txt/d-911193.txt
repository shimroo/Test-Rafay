 5/5 




i have been following frank’s photography for several years, and have seen his work grow and become more spectacular with each of his photography outings.  whether he’s capturing his iconic birds, zeroing in on insects, or snapping the elusive action shot of wildlife, every photo is drenched in perfect color, clarity and framing, making you feel like you were viewing the scene first hand.  his descriptive backstories on facebook of how the photos came to be only further enhances your appreciation of his breathtaking artwork.  thank you mr. bartlett for sharing the fruits of your extraordinary talent with us.  debbie d.
