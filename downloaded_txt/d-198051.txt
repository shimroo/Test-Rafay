jean scott is best known for encouraging 
    smarter casino gambling. you may have already seen her, as she has often 
    appeared on tv in prime time and cable tv specials, especially on the travel 
    channel. dan rather dubbed her "the queen of comps" on 48 hours. dateline 
    nbc followed jean through the casinos, filming her strategies for playing 
    the right games and maximizing comps (short for complimentaries, those 
    freebies handed out by casinos).
jean does not offer any "magic bullets 
    for successful gambling. she does not offer some easy-sounding system or any 
    concepts that go against proven mathematical facts. what she does offer is 
    sound gambling advice based on her 20 years of experience in casinos. her 
    down-to-earth practical suggestions will save you both time and money in 
    your quest to make your time in the casino more fun and more profitable.
but it is best for jean to speak for herself

    other smaller country.
