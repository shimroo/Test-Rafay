unboxing experiance... all wrapped up!
every pet portrait we create is thoughtfully packaged to make the unboxing experience just as memorable as the artwork itself. each portrait is carefully wrapped in delicate tissue paper, placed in a custom gift box, and finished with a beautiful ribbon.




"going into this process felt a bit overwhelming. starting from scratch and trying to find someone who could give us what we wanted seemed like an impossible task at first.
 
          i saw so many dog portraits online that were a little too impressionistic, or seemed to not accurately represent the animal they portrayed. i dreaded sending off pictures to an artist and getting back an expensive painting that looked nothing like my dogsters.
the reality of the process with melanie and nicholas was a dream. they were so careful, thoughtful, and responsive along the way. they worked hard to make sure that we knew what we were getting and were going to be happy with it. they collaborated with us on the source material and allowed us to track each step of the creation once it began. there was no opportunity for unwelcome surprises given the diligence of their process.

we are so happy with our choice. we wanted the best and thatâs what we got....."

â nicole poteat





"pure genius, talent such as that possessed by nicholas and yourself should be treasured. chester and minnie have been captured in a way that we could only have hoped for but perhaps never really expected. 

        i wish that you both knew our dogs because only then could you really appreciate how accurately they have been portrayed. i could go on and on but it's easier to simply say 'we're delighted'. 

        i shall be recommending you both to just about everyone with an animal. perhaps somewhat oddly, i will continue to read your blog even though the pictures are finished. i'd really miss it if i didn't."

â carl cooper
