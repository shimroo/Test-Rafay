          üßë‚Äçüíº¬†trend #3 of 5: labor shortages & retention ‚Äì the ongoing challenge

the hospitality industry continues to face significant labor shortages. 52% of hotel operators report difficulty hiring and retaining housekeeping staff. in response, resorts are offering higher wages, flexible schedules, and other incentives to keep employees motivated and engaged.

üí°¬†key takeaway: focusing on employee well-being and offering career development opportunities are key strategies in combating labor shortages and reducing turnover in housekeeping teams.

üìä¬†this is the third post in a series of 5 key trends observed by sun hospitality in 2024.

          proper insurance¬Æ
        






 

              
          darren: "hands down, the best coverage? *no limit on guest damage!*" üéâ but let‚Äôs set the record straight: vandalism coverage ‚â† guest damage coverage.

if your guest throws a rager and leaves your place in shambles, that‚Äôs not vandalism‚Äîit‚Äôs just some good ol‚Äô guest mayhem üò¨ and guess what? that‚Äôs usually not covered under a standard landlord or homeowners policy.

but proper insurance isn't your standard policy. we know the risks you face as a short-term rental owner and designed a policy that actually provides coverage you need, like guest-caused damage with no limit. üõ°Ô∏è‚ú®

          the tech move
        






 

              
          the hospitality industry has faced its share of challenges in recent years, but for many, issues around staffing continue to pose a problem. a lot of hotels around the world are struggling to attract and retain employees, which in turn is impacting their operational efficiency, service, and ultimately, the guest experience.

so what‚Äôs the answer? there are many factors at play, but creating a positive, communication-friendly work environment is an essential ingredient, especially one that‚Äôs free from language barriers‚Ä¶ and this is where #artificialintelligence can play a crucial role.

combining hardware, cloud software, and mobile connectivity, relay is seeking to eliminate language-related barriers with its breakthrough ai functionality, allowing for real-time face-to-face language translation via talk or text. their "teamtranslate" enables teams to select their preferred language so all messages they send or receive are automatically translated accordingly ‚Äì a potential game-changer for #hospitality.
