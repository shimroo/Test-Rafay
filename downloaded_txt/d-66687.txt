hello

i am fine and dandy, i just haven't posted much at all lately. i can blame it on buddy ;)  every time i sit down at my computer which is upstairs buddy appears and barks for me to come back downstairs and join him there.

i try to get him to rest by my side but no !! he wants me downstairs in the den.

spoiled rotten.  just like a three year old toddler.

but he is sooo cute and so much company now that our grandchildren have gotten so busy and grown up. :(

the atlanta ones are now 12, 14, 13 and 16. doesn't seem possible but they do  grow up so fast...

cheers

male sensitivity





touching male sensitivity

 

the room was full of pregnant women with their husbands.

the instructor said: "ladies, remember that exercise is good for you. walking is especially beneficial. it strengthens the pelvic muscles and will make delivery that much easier. just pace yourself, make plenty of stops and try to stay on a soft surface like grass or a path."

"gentlemen, remember -- you're in this together, it wouldn't hurt you to go walking with her. in fact, that shared experience will be good for you both."

the room became very quiet as the men absorbed this information.

 

after a few moments a man, name unknown, at the back of the room, slowly raised his hand........”yes?" said the instructor.

"i was just wondering if it would be all right if she carries a golf bag while we walk?"

 brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?

this kind of sensitivity just can't be taught.

bad week at black rock




last week my husband came down with a bad case of bronchitis. he finally let me take him to the doctor this past tuesday.  he got an antibiotic and pill for the cough. i sat in with him as he saw the doctor. i was fine then, maybe just a tingle in my nose.

then  tuesday night i woke up with a full fledge case of what he has plus an awful case of acute cystitis.  i had never had this before. real bad pain. went back to doctor and got two antibiotics for myself plus cough pills.  they did a urine culture and i did have bacterial infection. 

yikes !!!!!

better now i am happy to say :)  
 
what did we ever do without antibiotics?

been in all week

even buddy is getting cabin fever.

my dog buddy is doing just fine. he will be three years old on july 9th. he is a sweetie pie,at least most of the time. i guess when he gets out on our deck and barks at the passing parade of other dogs walking by our townhouse he is exercising his god given right to vocalize. he thinks he is protecting us.  and besides:
 "fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly"

 and dogs gotta bark :)

i am going to physical therapy every wednesday for my balance problem and tendency to fall. 

i think i am making good progress.

the most difficult exercise for me is the one where i have to step over small cones that are lined up. i must step over these cones sideways. not easy.

i would never pass a field dui test. :)

lady's yearly exam
i went to the doctor for my yearly physical. the nurse started with certain basics.

"how much do you weigh?" she asked.

"135," i said.

the nurse put me on the scale.

it turns out my weight is 180.

the nurse asked, "your height?"

"5 foot 4," i said.

the nurse checked and saw that i only measure 5' 2"

she then took my blood pressure and told me that it is very high.

"of course it's high!" i screamed, 'when i came in here i was tall and slender! now i'm short and fat!"

she put me on prozac.

what a bitch
