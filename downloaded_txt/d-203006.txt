exploring scotlandmonday,march 10, 2025 7:30pm



this webinar is part of the fred & edie greene speaker series

exploring scotland – from land, sea, and skye
david clow
david travelled to scotland for more than a month in september 2023. his main photo interests were the wildlife and rugged landscapes close to the sea, given his background as a marine biologist, and a love of ocean kayaking.
covering more than 3000km across the country, including the shetland islands, david was drawn most strongly to the isle of skye.  while on this largest island in the inner hebrides, he spent eight (8) days of nonstop photography and hiking.
this rural island landscape, gave him many opportunities to fly his microdrones and capture both still and video imagery that he could never hope to get on foot with his nikon z9 & d850 cameras. the drones opened up a whole new perspective on many types of photography; rugged seascapes, waterfalls, rivers & lakes, landscapes, viaducts, railways, boat traffic, and endless historic, iconic castles.
david was also drawn to scotland to explore his paternal ancestry, after two brothers emigrated from the highlands in 1785. that research led to some great architectural photography in urban areas, culminating with the university of glasgow cloisters, and doune castle. both sites were featured prominently in the recent popular tv series ‘outlander’. 
bio:
an avid photographer for more than 50 years, david enjoys most genre of photography – nature & architecture to portrait/studio photography. av show production has also provided personal satisfaction, as well as public fundraising opportunities.
since 2022, he has added drone imagery to his list of interests, producing both professional quality videos as well as still photography.
awards: canadian geographic photo contest, and capa av show competitions – (bronze medals in 2007 and 2024)
publications: remax realtor, canadian camera (capa), and canadian geographic.
solo exhibits: 1) ‘the people of havana’ at the national press club (ottawa), and 2) ‘journey to antarctica’, at the ra centre (ottawa). joint exhibits; 1) ‘prince edward island’ at nepean city hall; 2) ‘birds’, and 3) ‘bergs & birds’ – both at the new photographers’ gallery (sidney bc, 2021).
david is a certified judge for photography competitions – both the ontario council of camera clubs (o3c) and the canadian association for photographic arts (capa).
camera club memberships: ra photo club (ottawa), mississauga camera club, and the victoria camera club. he has provided camera club leadership in the image critique special interest group (sig) – for all clubs listed.
guest speaker credentials: ottawa, orleans, renfrew, algonquin park, oshawa, toronto, mississauga, vancouver, kelowna, and victoria. he recently lectured on ‘antarctica’, during cpc 2024 – capa’s biannual national photography convention.
