compare documents easily with compare suite

the compare suite project was started back in 2003. from the very beginning it was not designed as another tool for software engineers. instead compare suite was developed for office professionals. these are the professionals who don’t know much about using command line, running linux or writing console applications.
did we achieve our goal? yes! more over, even the above mentioned software engineers sometimes forgot about their unix toys and invested in compare suite pro. it is hard to say now who is the user of compare suite.
according to our case studies people use this tool for different tasks: regular analysis of reports, comparison of contract drafts, finding the difference between two spreadsheets, comparing pdfs and much more. some like compare suite for the reporting while others find its interface plain and easy to understand.
comparison of excel spreadsheets
for sure, there are some functions that make the difference. for example, as mentioned comparison of excel spreadsheets is not just text comparison. compare suite works smarter, it will tell users what the difference is between two numbers and will calculate this difference in percentages.
if the program finds different dates, it won’t just report the difference, but it will calculate what the difference is in days or months. in a number of forums compare suite is mentioned as a best choice for comparison of excel files.

3rd party compare tool for dms system
what we had to have in mind when developing compare suite is that the document doesn’t end its life on a user’s desktop. normally, there is a long story behind any document. in some cases it was extracted from a company’s document management system, and the name was pasted as a parameter to compare suite (we call it integration with dms). in other cases a user simply dragged and dropped the file on compare suite’s form.

compare files from archives
the program has to fulfill all of the needs that a professional might have. for example, compare suite can extract files that you need from zip or a rar archive or download data for comparison from your ftp server.

comment on changes and report
what happens with two documents after they were compared? users might simply review differences visually and close the program, or he or she might generate a html report with all the details about differences found and send it to their colleague.
there is a place for critique. once two documents are compared, it is possible to write comments on certain differences found. your boss might ask you why you have changed this in the draft of the document or you might ask your boss why these changes in requirements were introduced.

ignore text that is not relevant
integration with the document management systems that we mentioned above is just a part of integration in work cycle that compare suite provides. for example, when comparing documents regularly you might face the problem that time stamp in the footer of the document always distracts you from changes that matter. in this case you can adjust compare suite’s ignore functions. these functions gives a flexibility to ignore certain lines or lines with specific marks.

compare by words and by keywords
we know that during the work day professionals might face impossible tasks. we have to be prepared for this as well. what about comparison of two documents that have nothing in common? no common ancestor? no lines to compare? for this very case the “by keywords” function was introduced. try it to compare the text of two articles about the same topic copied from different websites. doing this simple keyword analysis you’ll learn a lot about language that different journalists use. and off course, this is the fastest way to compare two documents and to get an idea about the difference between them.

merge two documents into one
this is great tool for creative people. do you want to get two versions of the document and compile a new one that will incorporate all the best from both documents? sounds like a tough task and it is. technology can help you. in compare suite you will find a merge function that will help you with combining two documents.

compare ms office documents
what is the file format of the documents that you normally deal with in your office? is it pdf, ms word or excel workbook? do you use files created by free open office? do you have a presentation designed in powerpoint? compare suite supports various file formats so you don’t need to worry about compatibility. the program will process the most popular file formats and show you the difference.
when we start talking about processing of files users always ask how the files are processed and if it is secure. we do understand this concern. today when everything is in the cloud it is important to keep business critical information in your company not on the cloud server. compare suite processes all data locally without using any web services. what you open in compare suite stays on your pc only.

but also web pages as it looks in web browser.

we were talking about files only, but compare suite is as good with folders as it is with files. the program allows you to compare and synchronize two folders so that if you have to work on two different pcs you can always have a fresh copy with you.
