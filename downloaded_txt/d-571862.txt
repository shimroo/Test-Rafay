 christian renaissance media promoting the renaissance of christian culture  





“no single piece of our mental world is to be hermetically sealed off from the rest, and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which christ, who is sovereign of all, does not cry: ‘mine!’ ”— abraham kuyper
