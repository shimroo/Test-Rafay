about us:

our story began in 1945, when friends and business partners nate rimer and al mendelson first opened the doors of their original delicatessen on north beverly drive. now under the ownership of longtime customers shelli and irving azoff, we are proud to continue to build and grow nate and al’s dream; bringing classic deli favorites and more to new generations of customers. we honor the proud traditions of our past while working to create new traditions and favorites. we stand behind the humble ideals that have guided nate’n al’s for over 70 years: quality ingredients, service with heart, and food we’re proud to share with our friends.
