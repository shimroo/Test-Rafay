hi, i’m hugh.
for years i made films like no-one else.
now i make reality. virtually.


i’ve made an animated fantasy feature film the scale of the first lord of the rings movie on the budget of the blair witch project. i’ve made a career from telling stories in computer games, and i founded the site machinima.com, which appears to have rather taken over the world as the #1 youtube gaming channel.
hugh hancock must have been created by putting joss whedon and peter jackson in a blender.massively.com
in april 2016, i had an encounter that changed my life. an encounter with an vive room-scale virtual reality headset. now, i’m bringing two decades of storytelling and pen-and-paper games design experience to room-scale vr.
want to join me on this journey?
i’m constantly producing new experiments - from experiments pushing the limits of virtual reality to new stories of weird creatures, magic, and damaged heroes.
