 "fate-sgt. death", a re-issue cd !!
in 1968 i recorded an album in nyc with a band called fate, that got some attention at the time, but was never released. 2 small companies released copies of the demo acetate (it never got "pressed" at the time) as "fate- sgt. death", marketed as vietnam protest/60's psychedelic/re-issue music. the cd version, on shadoks music of germany (shadoks music 017) sold about 800 copies of 1000 printed. the music got rave reviews from promoters/fans of the genre!
