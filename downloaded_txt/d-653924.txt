free marketing tip
marketing used to have definite rules. and the rules applied until the world went crazy.
the modern marketing landscape is a chaotic symphony of noise. billions of sellers bombard us with millions of products and services every second of the day. competition is fierce, with countless individuals offering the same solutions as you.
the average consumer is overwhelmed. they’re constantly bombarded with marketing messages across every channel: websites, social media, radio, billboards, even roadside signs.
your message has a fleeting window of attention – roughly two seconds. to cut through the clutter, you must captivate your target audience immediately.
but don’t forget about your competition. your audience is actively comparing your offerings to those of your rivals. click for free condenced marketing book.
