anyone interested in moving to brooklyn? i was planning on living with 4 people (getting the place for september) but 1 is transferring to a school uptown in manhattan sooo if anyone is interested in living with 2 very lovely, nice, down to earth people (male and female) from arizona as well as myself we are looking for a new roommate. our max is $600 per person a month (hopefully will be finding something less) so if this sounds interesting to you....haha let me know. (gender, sexuality, smoking or non make no dif too) i'm serious though.

i had an extremely crappy freshman year. i'm completely unsure about whether i will stay at pratt or if i will continue to pursue my major. i'm not really sure what i want out of college anymore. after the next semester at pratt i hope to come to a conclusion about where to go or stay for college. lately i've been looking the cuny colleges and nyu. we shall see, we shall see.

this year has left me exhausted. i am le tired. almost everything didn't turn out the way i had hoped. which usually doesn't bother me, but it does this time. i don't know what to do. i am stuck and very stressed. i have not been more stressed.. ever.thoughts about transferring flit through my head.  i never have any idea what i'm doing. i just throw myself into it. head first i plunge into the next step and the next. sometimes good, sometimes bad but it does take you places.  all i know is i don't know i don't know i dont know i dont know idontknwo idontknowi dont know crrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrapppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp i was sick today. couldn't get out of bed. the return of caroline is scheduled for this weekend. i will purge. carocarocaro i am slightly homesick. (but i don't miss living in ohio.?) i miss the smell, the trees, the trees, the trees, the trees, and all of my goood goooood friends. i want to go back and cherish everyone. i want to make amends. i want to invest in everyone who i loved but was too timid to love more outwardly or too busy being self absorbed to spend more time with. i want to go back and get muddy. i want to go back to the john's house and drink tea and have funfunfunfunfun. and i want to go back to tab's house and talk all night at erin's kitchen table. and i want to go back to mel's and lie all night on the trampoline. i want to knock over gravestones at magree's. i want to go back. at least for a little bit. i miss the people so much. i miss sincere people.

my mind wanders away. sometimes i feel like i'm only half here. this leads me into trouble being only half conscious of my actions and words. i don't want to be here. and i certainly don't want to be there. being in this place makes me feel a mess. it's exhausting and monotonous. i feel stale.  i'm just killing time 'til the next big thing.

every now and then i am completely astounded by how inconsiderate and irresponsible people can be.  and then what just adds to my disappointment is how defensive and nonchalant they are about all of it when you approach them later. awesome. i fuckin love people. /rant
