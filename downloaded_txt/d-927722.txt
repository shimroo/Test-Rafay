this blog has moved





9:18 am

gil student




after a great get-together last night, we are ready to move the blog to a new format that has more functionality and is more esthetically pleasing. please change your browser bookmarks to this website: www.torahmusings.com. all new posts will be there only. all old posts will remain here and there.

note that, in the past, there have been complaints about changes. that is why i gathered a focus group to test out the new blog. i received a lot of good feedback and made changes to the format based on it. however, the response was overwhelmingly favorable. if you have suggestions, please leave them in the comments to the welcome post on the new blog.

comments

comments on old posts will stay here. the disqus comments will slowly be copied to the new blog while the haloscan/js-kit comments will remain here. that way everyone will be able to access all old comments. just please give me some time to migrate all the comments. i will begin with the most recent posts so the conversation can continue on the new blog.

is creativity possible in the information age?





9:25 pm

gil student




we live in an age where more information is available with greater ease than ever before. this applies to torah just as much as any other subject, perhaps even more. the ingathering of exiles that broke down (to some degree) communal barriers, the relatively low cost of publication thanks to printing technology, the electronic revolution that opens entire libraries through your computer, and the widespread wealth that allows people to take advantage of these technologies offer unprecedented amounts. but is all this information stifling?

shabbat mevarchim





2:24 am

rabbi ari enkin




by: rabbi ari enkin

there is an ancient custom to bless the upcoming jewish month on the shabbat which precedes rosh chodesh. these shabbatot when the new month is blessed are referred to as “shabbat mevarchim”.  a central feature of this prayer is the public announcement of the exact time the new moon, known as the “molad”, is set to appear.[1]  the molad is the exact moment of the moon’s renewal. recall that at the concluding moments of every lunar cycle the moon is positioned directly between the earth and the sun and is completely invisible.

drinking wine during the nine days and the authority of the shulchan aruch





9:33 pm

gil student




guest post by rabbi aryeh leibowitz

the shulchan aruch records a tradition to refrain from drinking wine during the period of the nine days leading up to tishah be-av. in a recent lecture delivered in teaneck, prof. daniel sperber argued that the entire passage in the shulchan aruch is based on a faulty interpretation of a passage in the talmud yerushalmi (sperber’s full analysis of this issue appears in his monumental work, minhagei yisrael).

quick takes

does the internet make you dumber?
a few weeks ago, much was made of a new book which claims that technology makes people less able to think critically and concentrate. the hype did not impress me. what we're dealing with is an onslaught of information and people have to develop internal filters. you have to know when to turn everything off and, when it's on, how to find the good information while avoiding the bad. even before the internet, many people procrastinated, had trouble focusing, and ignored their spouses and children. it's hard to blame that on the internet.
