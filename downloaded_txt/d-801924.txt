from robin lovelock:
i officially retired in 2012, but my wife june says that i retired 10 years before ! gpss.co.uk began in 1995
for my gps software business - now a hobby. 
millions of copies of gpss had already been distributed on pc magazine cd.

over 10,600 people in 153 countries contacted me then used gpss.

satnav was very new then, and gpss did much more. e.g. 

radio direction finding

and 

avl / chase
. 

gpss spoke your language. e.g. russian or japanese.
some pages are still updated.


e.g. snoopy's attempts to cross the atlantic from uk to usa, almost every year since 2012.
see

snoopy's robot sailing boat
or click on the changing picture to the right.


since 2002, i maintain the

nhscare.info coughlan campaign charity
 site,
 helping people in the uk to use the law to get
free long term care from the nhs, and not have to pay for the care home.
i also have inside knowledge
into uk nhs mental health treatment.
see my
grumpy
page, with my personal views on world events.


much of gpss.co.uk has changed little over more than 25 years.
since i retired, i'm too busy for paid work.

visit my
bigger picture
page, to see how we spend time.

e.g. 
hobbies
 and
holidays
or
walks

:-)




















i entered defence industry as an apprentice in the mid 1960s. 

ferranti

 sent me to 

city university

for a b.sc in electrical & electronic engineering.
that's where i saw 

dr strangelove
 .



i became a systems engineer, and work included royal navy ship software.
i worked for shape as a nato scientist through the 1970s, when gps and the internet were secret.
see
robin's memories of shape technical centre and john manniello
.
our young family returned to the uk in late 1980 and
i worked for 
easams

 until starting our small
gps software business in 1994 - now a hobby.
in publicity about snoopy's robot boat, the press called me a "retired nato scientist".
perhaps that should be "mad retired nato scientist" :-)






















see
asontv 
and my youtube channels

for me.




the 
bigger list of my pages are here

this gps software pioneered navigation and remote tracking for military, police, business, and the public. 






see
how to navigate
 with this gps software (gpss).

then
download
and run it on your pc to see a demonstration. 


run gpss on a laptop or pocket pc with a gps, and this same 
gps software will work for real.


need a gps ? click on
gps for advice.

see
robin's new toy: the linx 8
and
gpss with speech input.













see
amateur radio
and
radio direction finding
pages.
e.g. tracking a radio transmitter. see picture on the right.


techys can
add mapping to gpss.
e.g. from bing and google maps; sounds for spoken guidance.



"it's like having a little friend in the car with you" :-)



make
gpss speak other languages.



















tried
geocaching 
? "gps teasure hunting" started in 2000. great fun ! :-)












"speed trap ! watch your speed !"

 - see the 
speed warning page.



















see avl/chase
page for remote tracking, including fleet management and security applications.



the last software update was
gpss baseline v6.97 november 2011
with gpssppc v14 for pocket pc based smartphones.




"where is the book ?"

see
user guide to gpssppc for pocket pc and
gpss guide for windows.













gpss can track and control multiple vehicles from a fixed
or mobile pc, by use of mobile 'phone, radio or satellite communications.


the objects tracked may be vehicles, people, boats, or even
bottles.

they may be many miles away, but seen on mapping
for 164 countries - right down to "house level" maps.


gpss can be used in "chase" mode, guiding the driver to a mobile target. see
asontv for uk police doing this in 1996.

play this video to see what else this free gps software can do.







you will see that i am extremely "up front"
about who we are, and our gps software business since 1995 - now a hobby :-)







see my
business page.

big resources are not needed
to give people permission to use gpss,
or make the occasional software change. i've worked
in larger companies and on larger projects than most people, and have no need to pretend
what i am not. 
i greatly respect others who are able to be equally "up front" about
themselves and their own business - however small it is - so don't be shy :-)





i would like to thank the many thousands of "enthusiasts" around the world who
helped us test and improve gpss. this was a family business,
but it is still a great network of friends. 






thankyou.
