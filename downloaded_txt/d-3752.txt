toptracer range technology



upbeat, cool, focus on fun



escape the day, it’s time to play
















does the whole golf scene seem like a huge buzz-kill sometimes?



you show up at the course, excited to tee it up, only to get hit with a long list of can’t-do’s from the pro shop dude.  thanks a lot, mr. buzzkillington.oryou bust your butt at work all day, pumped to play. you show up on time, hit the first tee with your buds and mrs. funsucker tells you you’re late and demands that you tuck in your shirt.not cool! not fun! definitely not the place to be.



























at the nash, the party doesn’t begin until you walk in!






















music everywhere, and turn it up - even in your cartgolf is supposed to be fun. we create an upbeat, fun, and friendly atmosphere with music everywhere! pump in your own tunes with bluetooth speakers on your cart!























your four hours of fameyou are not a customer. you are a welcomed celebrity in the hearts and minds of every staff member here. pbn only hires friendly people who are excited to share in your great day.























toptracer range technologycompete with your buddies or dial in your yardages with toptracer range technology just like you see on tv. even enjoy a cold drink & cool tunes right on the range!















































palm beach county’s best value - by far!we get it, you’re always looking to get more for your money.  you deserve great value. we make golf affordable because we want you to love it so much that you’ll come back again and again.  























tasty food at the pbn tiki truckquick and tasty food for delivery, grab and go, or casual, outdoor dining. of course, there’s great music, an upbeat vibe, and flowing cocktails and beer.























legendary joe lee masterpiece with vintage south florida charmwith brand new bunkers and all-new tiff eagle greens, the course has never been better. year-round excellent conditions - just another reason the nash is the place to be!





    make a tee time
  


























we totally understand. the list of “don’t-do’s” is so long at old-school courses, there’s no room for fun! 

we get it! we know what it’s like to shell out hard-earned cash and invest six hours of our day at a golf course, only to be treated more like an unwanted nuisance than a valued and welcome guest. 

what’s that all about anyway? no other entertainment venue would treat you that way! you deserve an upbeat, fun, and friendly experience every time you step on the golf course. that’s why we make it our mission to make you smile. 

and that’s why over 90% of players would recommend palm beach national to their friends. and that’s probably why the people’s poll on golfadvisor rated pbn the 4th favorite place to play in america - in america!!!
 















when we say “play the nash,” we mean “play!” 







          “this is what golf is all about. the staff makes you feel welcome and the atmosphere is laid back and festive. i really liked the layout of the course. there are some absolutely beautiful holes. my two favorite are the island green par 3 on the front nine and #18. the rum shots are delicious and appreciated. this course is just what the doctor ordered for people who want to play a beautiful course with a friendly staff and festive atmosphere.”“this is going to be fun.from the moment you pull into the parking lot you can tell this will be different and in a good way. the most fun playing golf in a long time. it’s party zone golf. serious about golf but way more fun. service is great, people are super friendly and the music is awesome. free shots from the ranger didn’t hurt either. a must play when i am back in west palm.”

 the reviews are in! hear from some of our recent guests




“that was fun. from the moment we drove up and were greeted with a sign that said “here for a good time!” to sinking the putt on the last hole for par, it was a beautiful afternoon at palm beach national. the driving range is awesome. barrels and targets to hit into. it’s a total blast. there’s a tiki hut and music playing all the time. the food truck had everything we wanted. plenty of booze, a corona and an italian sausage hero. it was delicious. the course is one tough track. be patient and don’t be too aggressive. play smart golf and you can score well. first time there today and shot 91 from the whites. had a 9 on 15. the staff couldn’t be nicer. this is one cool place. worth many rounds of golf, don’t miss it. we’ll be back!”

— john edmond becker google local guide

look - we get it. we know how uncool and uptight most golf course experiences are. tradition is important, but let’s lighten up. we’re not saving lives! most golf courses insist on enforcing outdated, uncool and, when you think about it, pretty crotchety rules that really take the fun out of golf. they create an atmosphere that is intimidating, cold and unfriendly.
that’s why everything we do at pbn is intentionally designed around making golf fun and making you feel like the most important person in the world. you’re spending your hard-earned money and investing your time to escape the bs we all face every day. that’s why we strive to make palm beach national south florida’s most fun and friendly golf experience, from the toptracer range, to the 18th green, to the clubhouse. it’s the place to be!
