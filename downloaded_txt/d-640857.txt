ontario north - look no
further for your outdoors vacation
ontario fishing lodges and hunting camps! they are the
greatest vacations in canada! whether you want to casually fish or try some more serious
angling, our province is a anglers fishing paradise. nowhere else can boast such a
catch. think of it: the largest fresh water lakes in the world, a huge diversity of
angling and walleye in abundance. what's more, there's an entire range of experiences that
allow you to "go remote" at fly-in camps in the northwest and northeast, or cast
a line on day-trips in our playground. whether you spinfish, fly fish, are a dedicated
bass angler, or just like to race minnows, we are the place to drop your
line. wherever you choose to go, remember, you'll need an outdoor card and a licence
before you bait up. licences and copies of regulations are available at most tackle and
bait stores and ministry of natural resources offices. come on in and have a look around!
