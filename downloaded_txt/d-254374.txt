get ready to learn! 
understanding magic mushrooms 
magic mushrooms contain a natural compound called psilocybin. this compound interacts with the brain and can produce unique psychedelic experiences. 
what are magic mushrooms? 
magic mushrooms contain a natural compound called psilocybin. this substance affects the brain and alters perception, mood, and cognition. people often refer to these fungi as psychedelic or hallucinogenic mushrooms due to their mind-altering effects. 
various types exist, including psilocybe cubensis and psilocybe semilanceata. 
in recent years, many states have embraced psilocybin services for therapeutic purposes. users report profound experiences that can lead to personal insights and spiritual journeys. 
as interest in psychedelic therapy grows, consumers seek out reliable magic mushroom dispensaries for safe access to these products. 
how do they work? 
psilocybe mushrooms contain a compound called psilocybin. once consumed, the body converts psilocybin into psilocyn, which directly affects the brain. this interaction alters serotonin levels and changes how people perceive reality. 
many users report feelings of euphoria, enhanced creativity, and altered sensory perceptions. 
psychedelic effects can last from four to six hours during a mushroom trip. users may experience vivid visual hallucinations or deep introspective insights. different types of magic mushrooms produce varying strengths and effects as well. 
understanding these experiences helps consumers prepare for their journey into this unique world of natural medicine and alternative therapy. 
types of magic mushrooms 
magic mushrooms come in various types, each with unique effects and characteristics. understanding these varieties will help you make an informed choice when visiting a magic mushroom dispensary. 

psilocybe cubensis: this is the most common type of magic mushroom. it offers strong psilocybin effects and is popular among users for its accessibility and reliability. 


psilocybe semilanceata: known as the liberty cap, this species grows in grassy areas. it produces a potent experience and contains high levels of psilocybin. 


psilocybe cyanescens: often called wavy caps, these mushrooms have a distinctive wavy cap shape. they tend to be more potent than psilocybe cubensis, providing intense mental effects.

each type has its distinct qualities that influence your mushroom trip experiences, so choose wisely based on your preferences and goals during your visit to psilocybin dispensaries. 
what to know before trying magic mushrooms 
before you try magic mushrooms, consider your preparation and environment. choose a safe space and decide on your dosage carefully for the best experience.

choose your setting  a quiet, familiar place works best for a magic mushroom trip. whether you prefer indoors or nature, pick somewhere that feels safe. avoid crowded or chaotic environments. 


alter lighting  soft, ambient lighting creates a relaxing atmosphere. bright lights can be harsh and uncomfortable during your trip. consider using candles, fairy lights, or dim lamps to set the mood. 


gather comfortable seating  soft furniture invites relaxation during your experience. cushions, blankets, or bean bags can provide comfort while consuming psychedelic mushrooms. make sure you have enough space to stretch out if needed. 


limit distractions  silence your phone and turn off screens to minimize interruptions. background noise can disturb your focus during psilocybin consumption methods. create a playlist of calming music or nature sounds if desired. 


prepare others around you  inform friends or family about your plans if they are nearby. having a trusted person with you can provide reassurance during the trip. they can also guide you back if feelings become overwhelming.

set intentions  think about what you want from the mushroom trip beforehand. setting clear intentions helps guide the experience positively and helps with self-discovery amidst the shamanic influences of psychedelics. 


consider dosage carefully  research psilocybin dosage guidelines before trying magic mushrooms for the first time. start low and gradually find what suits you best for both therapeutic uses and personal exploration. 


have hydration on hand  keep water nearby throughout your session to stay hydrated after consuming psychedelic gummies or chocolate products like magical edibles available at dispensaries. 


be mindful of timing  plan your day around the anticipated mushroom trip duration, typically lasting 4-6 hours but varies by dosage and individual body chemistry.\ 

creating an optimal environment improves your overall experience when visiting a magic mushroom dispensary for psilocybin exploration. 
dosage 
dosage plays a crucial role in your experience with magic mushrooms. beginners should start with a lower dose to gauge their reactions. for dried psilocybin mushrooms, 1 to 2.5 grams is common for first-time users. 
this amount can provide mild effects without overwhelming sensations. 
mushroom consumption methods vary greatly and can impact the overall experience. psychedelic chocolate or capsules may offer precise dosing options for new consumers. as you become more familiar with magic mushrooms, you may choose to increase the dosage gradually based on your comfort level and desired effects.

the impact of cannabis on dream recall 
cannabis use has been found to reduce dream recall, particularly among heavy users of the plant. 
reduced dream recall in heavy cannabis users 
people who use a lot of cannabis often have fewer dreams. they may not remember their dreams well. this is due to the effect of thc, a key part in cannabis. thc can make you sleep deep but it cuts down the time we dream called rem sleep. 
when there’s less rem sleep, there are also fewer chances for dreaming to happen. so, heavy pot users might find they don’t recall their dreams as much as before they started using cannabis. 
potential role of thc in suppressing rem sleep and dream recall 
thc, which is a compound found in cannabis, may play a role in reducing rem sleep and dream recall. rem sleep is an important stage of the sleep cycle where we experience vivid dreams. 
research suggests that thc can interfere with this stage of sleep, leading to decreased dream recall. this could be why some heavy cannabis users report having fewer dreams or difficulty remembering their dreams. 
while more studies are needed to fully understand the effects of thc on sleep and dream activity, it’s interesting to explore how cannabis may affect our dreaming experiences. 
the intriguing study on cannabis and dream recall 
this section provides an overview of the study design and methodology, highlights the findings and implications of the study, and discusses the need for further research and considerations in this area. 
overview of the study design and methodology

they also measured participants’ thc levels using a urine test. the study design involved comparing dream recall in heavy cannabis users versus those who didn’t use cannabis or used it infrequently. 
the researchers analyzed the data to understand the impact of cannabis on dream recall and the potential role of thc in suppressing rem sleep and dream activity. this intriguing study provides valuable insights into how cannabis may affect our ability to remember dreams. 
findings and implications of the study 
the study found that heavy cannabis users have reduced dream recall. this could be because thc, a compound in cannabis, suppresses rem sleep and affects dream activity. it also affects memory function. 
these findings suggest that marijuana use can interfere with the brain’s ability to remember dreams. the implications of this study are important for individuals who rely on their dream recall for therapeutic or creative purposes. 
it also highlights the need for further research to understand how different strains of cannabis and methods of consumption may impact dream experiences and overall sleep quality. 
further research and considerations 
further research is needed to fully understand the connection between cannabis use and dream recall. while some studies suggest that heavy cannabis use can reduce dream recall, more research is necessary to determine if this effect is consistent across different strains of cannabis or methods of consumption. 
additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the potential role of cbd in modulating dream activity and whether certain terpenes found in cannabis may have an impact on dreaming as well. 
understanding these factors could provide a better understanding of how marijuana affects sleep patterns and memory function overall. 
conclusion 
in conclusion, the study exploring the connection between cannabis and dream recall has revealed some intriguing findings. heavy cannabis users may experience reduced dream recall due to the potential effects of thc on suppressing rem sleep. 
furthermore, further research is needed to fully understand the implications and considerations surrounding cannabis use and its impact on dream memory.

factors to consider when choosing any kind of strain


introduction 
cannabis commonly known as marijuana can be broken down into three subspecies namely; cannabis indica, cannabis sativa and cannabis ruderalis. ruderalis has low levels of psychoactive cannabiod. it is also hardly cultivated for use as a drug. let take a look on the main factors to consider when choosing between cannabis sativa vs cannabis indica strains.
a stable approach
a lot of people prefer to take a more balanced thc-cbd strain. this is because a stable strain is still able to produce the psychoactive experience though they are not as intense as thc- prevailing strains. cbd is the strain that induces or reduces thc’s ability to produce nervousness. this is one of the main elements to consider when choosing between indica vs. sativa strains. when the thc and cbd are balanced, the person taking the drug is not in a higher risk to experience negative side effects.
how dominant is cbd?
when choosing any kind of strain, one may prefer not to have the thc strains added. people who want to stay cool mainly prefer to have this type of strain. when cbd is in a higher percentage, the user is not subjected to the anxiety feeling.
thc dominancy
other that choosing a cool effect of cbd, other people may prefer to choose a weedsmart which is dominated with thc. thc causes a person to have a ‘high’ effect. this effect varies from one person to another. in case a person is new to cannabis consumption, thc can cause adverse effects to you so it is advisable to start with a moderate or lower amount of thc in order to learn your preferences and tolerance towards the drug.
amount of cannabinoids and terpenes
the amount of cannabinoid and terpenes are also some of the factors to use when choosing between indica vs sativa strains. the more weed you consume, the more effect it is going to have on you keeping in mind that there are other cannabinoids and terpenes found in a given terpene besides thc and cbd.
in summary, it is wise to consider the above factors when choosing any kind of strain depending on the effect you want.

what to know about cbd uses for dogs and cats


cannabidiol (cbd) is a phytocannabinoid that was discovered in the year 1940. it is an oil that is derived from the cannabis plant. cannabis has a wide range of compounds with different effects. some are very useful in the treatment and are always prescribed by medics. health-wise, cbd oil has been proved to be so important. however it is not legal in most countries. in this article, i will talk about the cbd uses for dogs and cats.
how it works.
cbd oil is equally important for cats and dogs as in humans. they both have a messenger system known as the endocannabinoid system, which regulates the immune system, appetite, pain, sleep, inflammation, and many more. cbd affects the activity of the messengers in this system and stimulates the nervous, digestive, immune system, and brain. the endocannabinoids in cbd are similar to the ones in cats and dogs hence the effect on them. below are the cbd uses for dogs and cats. 
benefits to dogs.
as painkillers- both dogs and cats are very active animals and depending on the breeds; others can be hyperactive. it is because of this nature that they sustain injuries, both mild and serious ones. these animals are no exception when it comes to pain, and this can be detrimental to their health. cbd oil can reduce pain when used consistently and appropriately. this is just one of the cbd uses for dogs and cats.
an anti-inflammatory – this is the property of a drug or a substance that enables it to reduce swelling. when an object like a stone hits a dog, their bodies swell like humans, and those areas can be so painful. cbd oils reduce inflammation in dogs and reduce pain by blocking pain signals to the brain. 
for skin health- our pets’ skin needs continuous care since it is their largest organ. different breeds need different care when it comes to their skin. for instance, a long coat german- shepherd requires more maintenance than a rottweiler. a study has shown that topical application of cbd oil on cats or dogs’ skins improve fur texture significantly.
bones and joints- ageing is inevitable, and when it happens to these animals, they face a condition known as arthritic pain. scientists discovered that when mature cats and dogs are given an endless supply of cbd oil as per prescription and massaging, it will help avoid arthritic pain. this is the most important of all the cbd uses for dogs and cats as they have a lifespan of 6-12 years.
possible side-effects.
the frequent use of cbd oil decreases the production of saliva, and this increases thirst in cats and dogs.when these drugs are given in high doses, they cause a temporary drop in blood pressure, which can cause light-headedness.most people use these drugs to treat anxiety, but when given in high doses, it can cause drowsiness. 
as discussed above, these cbd drugs are essential to the good health of both cats and dogs, though these drugs should only be given with prescription from a vet as wrong uses can be counter productive.

cannabis sativa has been shrugged by so many people for no arguable facts whatsoever. mostly, people look at the negative side effects rather than the positive impacts. negative side effects always occur due to the high dosage of the drug. as much as someone understands that too much of something is poisonous, then they will also understand that a high dosage of this herb may affect one to an unimaginable degree. the key objective of the usage of this drug is usually for stress relief, in other words, cannabis sativa is a relaxant. 
cannabis benefits 
there are some chemical components are associated with cannabis sativa. these chemicals which enumerate to a hundred (100) are beneficial in health-related conditions that affect most individuals. although two of them; tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) and cannabidiol (cbd) are more effective than the rest. these cannabinoids bring effect to the mind in various ways. these two are effective in the essence of relaxation and stress relief.

how cannabis works in inducing sleep


sleep is critical for maintaining our physical, mental, and emotional health. there are lots of people experiencing sleeping disorders, hence the rise of interest in one debated treatment: cannabis sativa/marijuana ganja online.  
cannabis induces a state of relaxation that may encourage sleep. some medical practitioners prescribe medical marijuana as a treatment for various sleeping disorders. 
cannabis sativa contains different cannabinoids, two of which are dominant: 
cannabidiol (cbd) – this is the non-psychoactive element; it does not cause the euphoric feeling 
tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) – this is the psychoactive component responsible for that euphoric feeling. 
a study was conducted where participants having sleeping difficulties and those without used cannabis before bedtime. both groups established that using cannabis reduced the time taken to get to sleep. 
cannabis has a therapeutic effect on people whose sleep is disrupted by anxiety, such as in the case of ptsd (post-traumatic stress disorder). although it helps them sleep, the long-term result of using the herb is unclear thus the need for more research in using cannabis to aid sleep. 
consider these before you try using cannabis to aid sleep: 
use marijuana responsibly. smoking is branded a health risk. smoking marijuana is hazardous especially for those that have respiratory illnesses.  
consuming cannabis during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not commended. medicinal use of marijuana is not legal in many states.  do not use any sleep aid for a long time. visit a doctor who will advise you accordingly.  
page break 
after your doctor approves the use of marijuana to aid with sleep you can visit a dispensary where you can choose a strain cannabis. these are common varieties one will come across: 
indica strain that causes a soothing and relaxing effect. often recommended for inducing sleep. sativa strain makes people feel eager, cheerful and energized. hybrid. an mixture of both sativa and indica.   
most people consume marijuana by smoking, vaping, or tinctures that are put under the tongue. for one to be sure how much marijuana to use, it might take several takes to get the dosage that is right for you. disclaimer: a little bit goes a long way and overdoing it can result in dizziness in the morning.  
conclusion 
lack of sleep can have a significant effect on a person’s mental and physical health. using cannabis requires restraint because it is unclear whether the drug can aid with getting sleep since studies produce mixed results on the case. 
over time cannabis use can be addictive and to have an undesirable effect on mental health, particularly in people who may be susceptible to mental health conditions. taking cannabis to induce sleep is an unnatural method that can lead to a dependency on the herb. 
we should try some of the following methods to combat sleeping problems: 
eating healthy foods; a balanced diet going to bed early 
ensure the room is dark and quiet when going to sleep exercise regularly  avoid caffeine close to time for bed avoid consuming large meals within an hour before bed

consume cbd outcomes and benefits

topical application 
if you’re mainly interested in trying cbd for muscle pains and aches, a topical application where you apply it to your skin rather than swallowing might be the right choice. the benefit of topical applications is that it is easy to implement and focuses on a specific area. athletes prefer it because it helps with injuries and pain. several cbd products are made for topical use. in most cases, such products are combined with other natural and herbal products to provide relief from various joint and muscle pains. if you experience joint pains and other related issues, this option can be beneficial to you. 
oral ingestion 
ingesting cbd is an excellent place to begin if you’ve never tried it before. you are probably already used to taking capsules and tablets, so taking cbd through these forms won’t be any strange. and, since pills come in pre-measured sizes, it’s simple to keep track of your dose. 
it’s crucial to get the right dosage, and getting a consistent concentration makes it simple to discover what works best for you. capsules may take up to 45 minutes to make their way into your bloodstream, and then they can stay for several hours. this method works efficiently and faster, and it is useful if you can consider it. 
tinctures 
tinctures are among the most common cbd consumption options. it requires the use of an eyedropper to absorb cbd sublingually and orally or under the tongue. when cbd is sublingually taken, it functions better, and more of it reaches your bloodstream. 
tinctures are mostly made up of three essential ingredients: alcohol, cbd, and some spice to make them more pleasing. the main reason why tinctures are so common is that it’s easy to get the right amount of cbd. you accurately take the exact measurements of what you require. 
edibles 
taking cbd with edibles is very much possible. cbd is now used in a variety of foods, gummies, beverages, and snacks. taking cbd in edibles makes it ideal for users on the go who want just a small dose rather than a continuous dosage.  
when it comes to edibles, one factor to bear in mind is the calorie content. it’s effortless to consume snacks excessively, whether they contain cbd or not. so it is vital to be more careful as you don’t want to consume excess calories and overdose on cbd. 
before you settle on the best way to consume cbd, you need to consider why you are using it and how it seamlessly fits into your life. it’s fair to try one method and then turn it up if necessary!

how to cook with cannabis


the simplest and precise means to perform it is by using a cast, but it is not pleasure. it may be costly if you cook so many times. below are seven steps explaining how to cook with cannabis.  
selecting a strain 
each burden is distinct. perhaps you need an increased burden. all functions are extraordinary. simply make certain to manipulate a strain that retains a prosperous countenance to obtain the maximum fitness advantages from the oil.  
determine the type of oil, you will expend 
if you obtained a tincture and attempted to combine it in a beverage, you possibly have known it does not incorporate nicely. this is because pot is not liquid dissolved, it stands as oil dissolved. unfortunately, promising expending a massive oil,  coconut oil, or canola. you may reasonably wield olive oil. canola retains a greater boiling point than coconut and olive oils. 
granulate your cannabis 
you may try the sprout, or you may need to expend other elements of the spice. before you simmer with your cannabis cuisine oil, you require to refine it primarily. to grind the weed, you require an integrity cannabis torpedo. you can also utilize a food processor grinder, but you would perhaps need to use prescribed processor mainly for that use. by using a eats processor, be confident you doesn’t granulate it so outstanding that it won’t stretch appropriately. 
now the oil and weed should be mixed in a cuisine appliance 
many prefer sluggish cook stove which incline to function nicely. nonetheless, you might expend anything you love. a saucepan also function wonderfully. secondly, blend the oil and sprout concurrently in your saucepan or hamper cook stove until the sprout has completely inundated in the oil. the rate of oil to weed you seek to manipulate rely on the prescription you observe. planning to simmer for visitor you have to expend the oil in numerous plates, you need to get on a broader percentage to avoid knocking out your visitors. 
granulate the weed in the oil 
toast up the combination in your unhurried cook stove or simmering pan for the cannabis to liquefy. using ample heat scorches your cannabis. you require to heat it to the maximum to crumble effortlessly. you can put in some water occasionally to retain your sprout from burning. 
distress your mixture 
stand cautious you are straining the oil mix. the mix should be strained when it is quite heated. remove the big chunks using a hook strainer. to make sure no flowers are left, run them via a tea filter or a piece of clothing. a piece of cloth functions nicer than tea filters because an enormous quantity is strained at one moment. moreover, when using the piece of cloth, operate with numerous coatings. sight the piece of the cloth on a salad stirring pot conserved with rubber. after straining the oil, spill it into an airtight goblet jug. heating the glass under hot water is a safety precaution that should be observed to avoid easy breakage of the glass and losing the oil you worked hard to make. 
directly stock or expend your weed oil 
you can now stock the oil in an airtight container or use it directly. using an airtight jar helps protect the potency and freshness of the weed oil. you can also frost it to formulate it to last lengthy shop cannabis with wtb.

 cannabis
how cannabis affect the brain


what is cannabis? 
cannabis is a herbal drug harvested from the cannabis plant. it is called a hard drug because of the chemical, cannabinoids, that are found in the plant’s leaves and flowers. the chemical is notorious for attacking the nervous system including the brain and nervous network. 
how is cannabis taken? 
cannabis is taken into the body through different modes. it can either be smoked or taken orally through the mouth. when smoked it may take an average of three hours to reach the peak level of intoxication. it is said smoking cannabis may be more harmful when compared to being taken as spray or orally. when taken orally it may take a longer time to manifest and reach peak level. mostly six to eight hours. oral ingestion eliminates ingestion of toxic substances that eliminates the risk of respiratory diseases. 
effects of cannabis on the brain. 
cannabinoids, the toxic chemical in cannabis attack mostly the brain. we are going to look at some of the conditions and effects impacted on the brain by cannabis. first, it has been proven that prolonged use of cannabis reduces iq capacity. this was proved after a series of research on patients suspected to be cannabis addicts. after the research it turned out that the iq of those who smoked cannabis at least twice a day dropped by 8 points after some time. apart from the iq, the brain capacity is affected when one becomes a chronic cannabis smoker. the brain size is said to reduce after a long time taking of cannabis, teens who start taking cannabis at an early age are the ones most affected. when they reach the age of 40 and above they start having problems with memory, they forget things easily. another condition caused by cannabis is psychosis, a condition that one gets into his own world, a spiritual world maybe. the addict hallucinates even in broad light. the brain of cannabis addicts responds differently to stimulus and rewards. in one condition,12 addicts suspected to have smoked cannabis for a long time were given a photo to interpret. they all had different opinions on what was on the photo, a thing that normal people had nearly the same opinions. 
europe’s approach to cannabis 
under international law, europe allows growth and possession of cannabis only for medical and scientific purposes. it is illegal to be in possession of the drug, a crime that can lead one to be sentenced to a jail term of 10 years or more. it should be clear to all that no national government especially in europe that has legalised sell of cannabis for recreational purposes. there have been proposals to the parliament to legalise its use in the past but the motions were rejected. there have been interviews conducted on young people regarding the banning of cannabis in european countries, about 60% supported the ban. 
conclusion 
we have seen how dangerous taking cannabis is to the health of persons taking it, especially the brain. more so, the government has laid down tough laws regarding the drug. there is nothing important than loving ourselves, let us care for our health, and avoid getting in bad terms with the law by avoiding to take the drug vancouver weed delivery.
