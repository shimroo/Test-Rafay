an original: modeling & role-modeling theory (mrm)






listening to and understanding the client’s view (i.e., model) of the world is the primary intent of establishing a trusting relationship between the nurse and client. then the nurse can plan strategies to promote holistic health that are meaningful to the client (i.e., role-modeling). the theory applies to persons of all ages and in any setting where a nurse-client relationship is established.


















“modeling is the process by which the nurse seeking to understand her client’s unique model of the world. role-modeling is the process by which the nurse understands that unique model within the context of scientific theories and, using that same perspective of [the] client’s unique model, plans interventions that promote health.”t-1

- t-1 erickson, h.c. et al., (1983). modeling and role-modeling: a theory and paradigm for nursing (p. 97). englewood cliffs, nj: prentice hall.

















creator of mrm theory:
helen l. erickson, phd, rn, ahn-bc, faan






dr. erickson originated mrm theory in 1957 as a nursing practice model. erickson and university of michigan colleagues, evelyn tomlin and mary ann swain, published the original mrm theory book in 1983. since then, erickson edited/wrote two additional books (2006 & 2010) that expanded upon the initial mrm premises. she is currently updating the basic mrm theory book for publication.
