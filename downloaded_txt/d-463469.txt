dog of the month

welcome to the bone adventure, “a best friend’s place to play”! established in 2003, the bone adventure has become the dog daycare, boarding, and grooming choice for thousands of orange county families. we strive to make our environment safe, secure, and fun so that your dog can enjoy his time away from you, and you can ease your mind and make the most of your travel, career, hobbies, and friends.
 
we have two costa mesa locations, bone home and bone backyard. both locations offer indoor and outdoor grounds, complete with k9 grass (custom grass for a dog environment), water features, customized sleeping arrangements, and enough dogs to keep your dog engaged, whether he is here just for the day, or boarding for a month! our staff members are well trained and their love of dogs show in everything they do. we rotate our employees to both locations, so wherever you decide to bring your dog on a particular day, there will be someone familiar to greet you both. please enjoy our new site, and contact us via phone or email to schedule an appointment for your dog’s first visit to the bone!
