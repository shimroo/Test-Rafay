★  ★  ★  ★  ★“the cottages were utterly timeless. it was as if you had walked back in time to a quieter and friendlier time and place. all the amenities you could want, but all the sweetness of staying at a five-star cottage. we felt secluded away at a private beach, but close enough to different restaurants and things to do if we chose. […] truly can't think of a place i have ever wanted to go back to a second time. this is the first time, and this is the one.”
