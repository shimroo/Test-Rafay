what our dental patients are saying




i have always had severe anxiety about going to the dentist. today i called with an emergency, the staff
                was friendly, understanding, and got me in just a couple hours. i genuinely appreciate blanco dental,
                they make going to the dentist office, even during an urgent situation, a "stress free" visit. i'm proud
                to refer others to them.

they were able to schedule more than one procedure per visit so that the bulk of my needs were met in
                three
                visits. i chose conscious sedation for these first three visits. after the third visit, dr. partridge
                talked to
                me about saving my money; i really did not need sedation. he told me that he was known as dr. "painless"
                partridge. i took his challenge. i must commend him for keeping his word. i wish to thank antonio for
                his
                pleasant demeanor in assisting. thank you vanessa for keeping the most painful part (payment)
                professional and
                congenial. thank you to all the staff for an overall doable experience. a+ grade to you, dr. partridge.

comforting sedation dentist in salinas
if you are nervous visiting the dentist, or if mobility issues prevent you from sitting in the dental chair for a long period of time, we can help with sedation. our dental office near monterey offers oral conscious sedation and nitrous oxide (laughing gas). the one that is right for you depends on your needs and the procedure being performed, but whichever you choose, you’ll finally be able to relax, completely removed from what’s going on around you. sometimes, patients only require one visit with sedation dentistry. afterwards, they realize there’s nothing to fear, and they are able to resume the regular appointments that keep smiles healthy and strong for a lifetime to come.

dependable family dentistry in salinas
most of the time, our patients just need the basics in dentistry -- general or preventive dental care. that includes two checkups and cleanings, fluoride treatments, digital x-rays, and maybe a small filling from time to time. when you visit us regularly, our dental team near king city can keep an eye out for the warning signs of larger problems. early detection of cavities, gum disease, faulty dental work, and other issues ensures we can provide the most conservative restorative treatment – such as fillings, crowns, or root canal therapy – at every turn.
it’s not just your smile that benefits from general dental care. people who have healthy teeth and gums are also more likely to enjoy better overall health. gum disease contributes to a number of health conditions, including heart trouble and respiratory issues, and may eventually cause total tooth loss. preventing periodontal infections is crucial for general wellbeing, and it’s easy with regular general dentistry.
patients of all ages should visit the dentist at least every six months. your salinas dentist welcomes the whole family, including your youngest smiles! around age three, your child should start coming in for a routine checkup and cleaning. kids love our friendly, welcoming approach – and affordable preventive care is crucial for proper dental development.
