"with the image of a hated job
                      that you want to escape by signing on to a riverboat, we
                      are following in the tradition of another great riverboat
                      song: 'proud mary' by the us rock band creedence
                      clearwater revival," the
                      self-proclaimed "collectors of pop" silvana and marc tell
                      us. but
why
                      riverboats? woog riots wrote the song while
                  silvana herself was working on a riverboat. the experiment
                  ended after a year. what remains is the song "riverboat to
                  amsterdam", which was of course performed and tested live for
                  the first time in the board bar on a trip from cologne to
                  amsterdam.
