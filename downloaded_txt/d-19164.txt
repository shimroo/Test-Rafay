here’s what some of our readers have to say about my management articles:
“i really like the way you present the issues. they are so informative and funny at the same time. this is my kinda humour. i’m sure you have as much fun writing it as much as i have reading it. all the best to you and keep up the good work!!”
– wali kashvi, australia
“i am vijaya and i work as a delivery manager in an it company. just wanted to drop by and tell you how amazing your site is. i stumbled onto your site today(so glad i did) and i am so impressed with the content. i am exactly the kind of a person you offer your advise to- the “rest-of-us” clan. i have stepped into a manager role few months back and your site is now on going to be my home page :). your articles are rich in content and very informative. i am planning to buy your ice-breakers e-book. keep the flow. i love your site.”
– vijaya arucapalli, india.
“many of the articles on the ‘management for the rest of us’ site are wonderfully useful and applicable even for those of us who are not employed as managers. i very much enjoyed looking at the site!”
