neon graveyard
the neon graveyard, located near downtown las vegas is located on mcwilliams and encanto, and it's where old, discarded neon signs go to die. you may have seen it in several movies filmed in las vegas, including "mars attacks," "vegas vacation," and many more. often called "the boneyard," the area is now managed by the neon museum, and they'll give tours by appointment only. regular appointment hours are tuesday-friday between 11:00 am-5:00 pm. other days and times subject to staff and volunteer availability. tours cost $5, and you can arrange to photograph or video the signs if you contact the museum ahead of time for their permission. these signs are some of the fascinating history of an entertainment town, and if you have time to visit the neon graveyard, don't miss it!

											where is the marshmallow factory in vegas, and do they offer tours?
									 	

favorite brands international marshmallow factory
in 1988, this marshmallow factory was destroyed when a factory next door blew up. they were cleaning up marshmallow in henderson for weeks afterward. what a mess. happily, the marshmallow factory is open for business again, including self-guided tours of the plant and production line. it's a good idea to check with the plant ahead of time so you know when the machinery will actually be running. when it is, you can see how they cook the marshmallow mixture and then blow air into it to create the fluffy treats we know and love. the best thing about this tour? it's free, and they even offer a discount bag of mini-marshmallows at the end of the tour! the favorite brands marshmallow factory is located at 1180 marshmallow lane in henderson. call 702-393-7308 for more information.

											is the ethel m chocolate factory open for tours?
									 	

ethel m chocolate factory
if you've ever wanted to see how they make your favorite chocolate candies, then this is the tour for you! ethel m's is another sweet factory located in henderson, on the corner of sunset and mountain vista, to be exact. you can combine this tour with the marshmallow tour and have quite the sugar overload by the end of the day! this factory tour is also self-guided so you can take it at your own pace, and it's free, too. this is a really interesting tour that shows how the chocolates are created, filled, coated, and packaged ready for sale. after you finish the factory tour, make sure to leave some time for the beautiful botanical cactus gardens out back. they show desert landscaping at its best. the factory and gardens are open daily for tours from 8:30am to 7:00pm. you can find out more by calling 702-435-2641. you can arrange special group tours by calling that number, too.
