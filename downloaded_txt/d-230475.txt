welcome. thank you for visiting this site.friesensolo is the culmination of my nearly 40 years of working closely with clients, artists, curators, interior designers, and architects.  friesen gallery sun valley and friesen gallery seattle has produced over 550 exhibitions. to my own amazement, this tally is astounding. i am deeply appreciative of the dedicated staff members and talented artists i have worked with over the years and my intention with friesensolo is to honor these relationships.now with no brick and mortar, solo allows me to be ever-evolving in the art world as a consultant, artist representative, gallery advisor, and more.i invite you to peruse these pages, reach out to me as desired, and share this site as you choose.with gratitude -
