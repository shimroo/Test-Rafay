        ...from tim & monique's collection




in our 
    search to obtain a collection of traditional native american pottery from 
    every one of the 
    21 
    southwest pueblos, we discovered beautiful examples of indian pottery from all over north 
    america.  the above represents our findings.  most of the sites are 
    active, while others are only occasionally active.  these sites can be 
    located on the associated pottery maps page.  
while gathering 
    the fabulous pueblo pottery and other pottery of the southwest desert,
    eastern 
    pottery -  with its wonderful forms - was a 
    surprise to us.  except in a few cases, these 
    pieces are 
    harder to find.  but most of our eastern pottery was 
    located by searching the 
    internet for contacts, as well 
    as from the ebay auction site.  we would like to encourage other 
    collectors of traditional pottery to pursue more representatives from the historical 
    woodland areas - you will discover some magnificently talented potters.  
and
    while you're at it, pick up some reference material 
    regarding the early 
mississippian and other eastern 
    pottery.  the forms and 
    effigies  will astonish those who first see them; and the artistic 
    skill will give the reader a new respect for the skills of the early pre-columbian people who 
    settled throughout the continent.  you'll also discover that much of 
    what you might think as "contemporary" native american pottery is not so 
    contemporary after all.  ancient styles and forms continue to influence 
    today's designs.
those of us 
    who have been attracted to the native art of traditional pottery in north 
    america understand each other.  we are surrounded by "non-collectors" 
    who rarely comprehend our appreciation - among whom, we carry our hobby like 
    a hidden addiction.  when we attempt to share the excitement of a new 
    acquisition with our non-collecting friends, we mostly receive blank stares or 
    polite responses.  some are genuinely struck by the skill and beauty of 
    a piece, but still can't  join our deeper passion.  so we remain 
    self-contented in our joy.
but we are proud 
    of the beauty (and moved by the historical aspects) of our collections and 
    wish to share them as best we can.  so to you, we present our modest 
    collection.
by doing so, 
    we hope to encourage others to become spectrum collectors by expanding their interest 
    into all places of north american traditional pottery  - so that none of it dies out due to 
    lack of interest.  there are far too many locations where the tradition is 
    fading or almost gone. we have to remember that we aren't just collecting, we're also helping to 
    preserve the historic talents of traditional potters.
if you are aware of 
    other active sites, please
    let us know.  
    we found out about several places this way.  and let's see your collections! we know that there are some huge ones
    out there, 
    or even small ones that you're proud of.  i don't know about you, but 
    we never get tired of admiring different pieces of traditional pottery.  
we hope that you 
    enjoy the fruits of our quest.  and remember, 
    it only takes three pieces to make a collection...
