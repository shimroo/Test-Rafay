welcome
what started as a passion for lotus in 1972 when my brother bought his first elan+2, soon developed into a business, when i acquired one of my own a couple of years later. the passion has not diminished nearly 40 years later and our thriving business in the county of kent in the garden of england is as enthusiastic as the day it started.
the heart of our business is the sourcing of interesting and rare lotus classics and all lotus derivatives, including caterhams, lotus cortinas and lotus carltons. we are keen to source new stock and will be delighted to discuss the potential purchase or commission sale of your classic or modern day lotus.
we are a family run business employing specialists in various fields of preparation and restoration of the many different lotus and caterham models.
we do take a multitude of other fine sports cars in part-exchange, mainly of british origin, so by all means try us if you have something interesting to sell.   please ask for paul or sam clugston who handle all classic and sports cars as well as lotus and caterhams.
feel free to pick up the phone for an informal discussion on 01227 728190 or drop us an email on: sales@uksportscars.com
we live, breathe and love the lotus marque
