department of mathematics and systems analysis
the seven main research areas of the department are: algebra and discrete mathematics, analysis, math&arts, mathematical physics, mathematical statistics and data science, numerical analysis, and systems and operations research. we offer major and minor studies at the bachelor's and master's level and provide doctoral research training. our graduates have been recruited by universities, research institutes, governmental agencies as well as companies in the financial, energy and transportation sectors, for instance.calendar19.2. 10:15  lin wu (xiamen university/aalto university): uniform weighted bounds for fractional marcinkiewicz integrals – m3 (m234)19.2. 10:15  victor mishnyakov (nordita): algebras and exact solutions of matrix models at finite n – m2 (m233)19.2. 14:00  vili kohonen: hybrid nitsche method for distributed computing – m2 (m233)20.2. 14:15  aki mori (setsunan university): simplex faces of order and chain polytopes – m2 (m233)25.2. 13:00  david adame-carrillo (opponent prof. alessandro giuliani): phd thesis defense: "lattice models and conformal ﬁeld theory" – r002/160a r126.2. 10:15  luis angel castillo lópez (universidad nacional autónoma de méxico): tba – m3 (m234)27.2. 14:15  kostiantyn tolmachov (universität hamburg): tba – m2 (m233)5.3. 10:15  aleksis koski: tba – m3 (m234)6.3. 14:15  thomas karam (university of oxford): tba – zoom6.3. 16:15  håkan hedenmalm (kth stockholm): conformally invariant gaussian analytic functions, holomorphic correlations, and operator symbols of contractions (fms colloquium) – 12.3. 10:15  aapo pulkkinen: tba – m3 (m234)12.3. 16:15  prof. marcus greferath (university college dublin/aalto): some old and new ideas on noiseless and noisy group testing – m3 (m234)visitorsanestis tzogias (université de neuchâtel) 1.9.2024–31.5.2025lin wu (xiamen university) 15.10.2024–14.11.2025berenike masing (freie universität berlin / zib) 14.1.–14.3.gerardo barrera vargas (instituto superior tecnico (ist lisbon)) 2.2.–15.2.nageswari shanmugalingam (university of cincinnati) 3.2.–31.5.michal borowski (university of warsaw) 3.2.–20.2.ioana ciotir (insa rouen, normandie université) 10.2.–14.2.aki mori (setsunan university) 15.2.–25.2.marcelo dias (the university of edinburgh) 18.2.–15.3.researchpublic defence in the field of mathematics and statistics, m.sc. david adame carrillo 25.2.202531. january 2025title of the thesis: lattice models and conformal ﬁeld theory
