good evening,
 
this is dr. serbrenia sims, superintendent of surry county public schools. in late october, we sent out a survey to parents, students, and staff members requesting feedback on the five focus areas as identified in our strategic plan. the feedback that we received provided needed information on areas that we are doing well in, as well as areas where we need to improve as a school division. the results of the survey are included in our comprehensive plan update to the community that can be found on our website. hard copies of the plan will be made available at each school, the school board office, and the county libraries. 
 
finally, we have one more day of school before our winter break, and i wish each of you a joyous and safe break. we look forward to seeing you in the new year!
comprehensive plan update for the community
