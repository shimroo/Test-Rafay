cuts to medical research: the chickenshit enablers in tn’s congressional delegation





investigative reporter, phil williams, reported yesterday on his question about nih cuts that he put to each member of tennessee’s congressional delegation: williams’ question to 11 federal legislators was this: do you support announced cuts in tennessee for life-saving medical research?of the two u.s. senators and nine u. s. representatives, all are republican except for rep. steve cohen. some dodged the question entirely, some provided non-answers to the question, and only one offered a straight answer to the question.  spoiler alert: it was not a republican.

new feature: tesla reviews 1





from china to norway to germany to the u.s., tesla sales have cratered since elon musk became the front man for president felon’s ongoing attempted coup.  thinking tesla dealerships would make good places to stage protests against the current government dismantling, i started looking around in nashville for tesla dealers.  i found the first dealer in near nashville in franklin at 122 market exchange ct franklin, tn 37067.aside from elon musk’s commitment to steal valuable data from american taxpayers that will benefit his businesses, it seems there are other reasons to not buy a tesla. some reviewers are clearly unhappy with the product and the service.  here are just 3 yelp reviews left for the franklin tesla dealership:oh, i almost forgot to mention that elmo’s new cybertruck is as unsafe as the old ford pinto.

resistance: use it or lose it, pt. 2





 now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.  in fact, it’s now or never!!!
americans are scared about what’s happening right now—because this. is. not. normal. 

but where are my republican colleagues? in closed-door meetings dismantling vital programs?

we are fighting back! we are taking it to the courts, taking it to congress, and taking it to the streets![image or embed]— rep. melanie stansbury (nm-01) (@repstansbury.bsky.social) february 11, 2025 at 2:50 pm
