dulcesky - i dreamt of you (lyrics)





dulcesky - i dreamt of you (lyrics)

shining bride
of angelic smile
you seem to float
as you come down the stairs
i lost you in the crowd
in the maze of this place

i ran through rooms
looking for you
i thought i saw your face
in a sea of smiles
you make my dream so real
i still awoke without you

bruno mars grenade lyrics





bruno mars grenade song lirics

easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
had your eyes wide open, why were they open?

gave you all i had and you tossed it in the trash
you tossed it in the trash, you did
to give me all your love is all i ever asked
'cause what you don't understand is


grenade! by acca11
browse more grenade t-shirts
i'd catch a grenade for ya
throw my hand on a blade for ya

bruno mars - circles lyrics





bruno mars - circles song lirics

got me going in circles c-circles
my heart is dizzy from you
got me going in circles c-circles
tell me what i’m supposed to do
you got me up at night
feeling like
you won’t come thru
got me going in circles c-circles
my heart is dizzy from you
round and r-r-r-round we go
round and r-r-r-round
i’m goin’ in circles c-circles
please girl!

i give you everything, but, it’s not enough
you started being easy but lately 
you’ve made it rough (for us)
you say you need me but then turn me away

bruno mars - california girls lyrics





bruno mars - california girls (gurls) song lirics


i know a place
where the grass is really greener
warm, wet and wild
there must be somethin' in the water
sippin' gin and juice
layin' underneath the palm trees 
undone
the boys
break their necks
try'na creep a little sneak peek 
at us

bruno mars bulletproof song lirics

ooh ooh oh oh ooh
oh oh

you've been hurt before
girl i know you
your heart's been through the storm 
and more
i can tell you barely survived

but girl my love won't be the same
i'm not trying to run no game
just want your tears to dry

bruno mars all about you lirics





bruno mars all about you song lirics

i know girl , when you look at me
you don't know how i feel
cause i'm usually so nonchalant
my feelings i conceal
but i want you to know
oh, i want you to know

i must admit i've felt this way 
for more than quite a while
but i can't hold it no longer 
when i see that pretty smile

fammi volare - drupi lyrics





fammi volare - drupi lyrics

la notte vola, la notte va
e tra silenzi e suoni vive la città
ci sono luci per chi vive insieme a lei
ci sono voci per chi parlerà con lei
e mi fa bene fermarmi un po'
pensare al tempo che ho perduto e che non ho
che non ho più per inventare poesie
dimenticando le promesse e le bugie.

18 carat man of means 10cc lyrics

i need some money to open doors
i won't bend over or lick your paws
you got me red, i'll get me black
my tar town checks come bouncin' back 

he wears my suit to make a good impression

don't rip me off
'cause i'm a

superbus - mes défauts lyrics





superbus - mes défauts song lyrics


penser à me lever plus tôt 
ca je n'ai pas le temps
penser à te dire que t'es beau
ca je n'ai pas le temps
aimer, donner trop
désolé j'ai pas le temps
faire tout comme il faut
euh, c'est pas dans mes plans

penser à tout plier plus vite
ca je n'ai pas le temps
penser à te dire je te quitte
un peu moins souvent
draguer être séduite 
désolé, j'ai pas le temps 
jouer de la musique
ah si ça j'ai le temps

ahahahohohoh
c'est mes défauts 
ahahahohohoh
j'suis pas dispo
un peu mito, un peu mégalo
ohohohohoho


ahahahohohoh
tous mes défauts
ahahahohohoh
je suis perso 
j'ai de l'égo, ça rends marteau
ohohohohohoh

superbus radio song lyrics





superbus radio song lyrics

j'en ai jamais assez, je suis vite lassée,
je voudrais combler ce manque
mon obsession me hante,
j'en ai jamais assez, je voudrais bien trouver
que j'ai beaucoup de chance,
me rendre à l'évidence,

we are we are on the radio now, 
the radio now!
we are we are on the radio now, 
the radio now!


j'en ai jamais assez, je vois toujours après,
des fois je me demande

no crime
what about sweet feelings, 
happiness and smile
no crime
do you best believe and 
don't deny

try to understand and open up your mind
no regrets, no lie
no betrayal , no crime 



no crime, no lie
no crime

no crime
what about sweet feelings, happiness and smile
