a large-scale binding and functional map of human rna-binding proteins figure 3. sequence-specific binding in vivo is determined predominantly by intrinsic rna affinity of rbps (van nostrand et al 2020)






concentration-dependent splicing is enabled by rbfox motifs of intermediate affinity figure 2: rbfox proteins reproducibly bind a class of secondary motifs with moderate affinity. (begg et al 2020)






exon-mediated activation of transcription starts. graphical abstract (fiszbein et al 2019)






cotargeting among micrornas in the brain figure 1. (cherone et al., 2019)






numerous recursive sites contribute to accuracy of splicing in long introns in flies. figure 4. recursive sites aid in efficient splicing of long drosophila introns. (pai et al., 2018)
