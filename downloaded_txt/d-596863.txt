steelpan education at 
							panontheweb.com






dr. patricia bishop has praised the
							pan in 
							education project for the important 
							features placed in a single, convenient and 
							attractive package. 
it records visually both on paper 
							and by means of the computer . it also records the 
							music aurally so that players can hear the music 
							even before they learn to play it. 
the project showcases a number of 
							bands and their arrangers so that a variety of 
							arranging and playing styles can be studied and 
							appreciated.
