(see diagram). this âpleatâ allows for more fullness to accommodate the bulk of the dowel and the quilt will hang flat on the front side. _____________________________arrow rightarrow rightwe had an amazing quilt show this year, and we couldn't have done it without your support! thank you so much for being a part of it!for more information and to see pictures, please click this link.heart 2 heart quilt show 2024things our guild members have made.arrow rightarrow rightinstagraminstagramfacebookfacebookemailemail
