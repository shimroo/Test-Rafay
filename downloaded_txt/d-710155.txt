research highlights by dst media cell









amalgamated hybrid materials enable brain-mimicking artificial synapses for computing breakthroughs
taking inspiration from nature, a group of scientists have amalgamated hybrid materials to form a robust biomimetic system that closely mimics the behavior of biological synapses. this can pave the path towards a new wave of innovation in computing with breakthroughs in robotics, machine learning, and real-time data processing.







quantum advantage unveiled: from theory to real-world demonstration
a new study on how a quantum system can outperform its classical counterpart reshapes our understanding of what is possible with quantum systems and hints at a future where quantum technologies might solve problems classical computers cannot, even when resources are scarce.
recently, researchers from the s. n. bose national center for basic sciences, an autonomous institute of the department of science and technology, working alongside the teams from the henan key laboratory of quantum information and cryptography, laboratoire dâ€™information quantique, university libre de bruxelles, and icfo-the barcelona institute of science and technology, have made a breakthrough.







mechanism identified behind exotic disordered state of matter could be used for optical data transmission & communications
researchers have explored the mechanism behind the emerging property of recently discovered exotic disordered state of matter, known as â€œhyperuniformityâ€�.

hyperuniformity is a property of certain heterogeneous media in which density fluctuations in the long-wavelength range decay to zero. hyperuniform disordered materials have been observed in a variety of settings, such as in quasicrystals, large-scale structures of universe, soft and biological emulsions and colloids, etc.







a new sustainable, efficient amide synthesis process can streamline drug production & reduce costs
researchers from s. n. bose national centre for basic sciences, an autonomous institute of the department of science and technology (dst), have introduced a novel method for synthesizing amides from alcohols using a covalent organic framework (cof) as a photocatalyst under red light irradiation. this catalytic method can be helpful in chemical processes across various industries, including pharmaceutical manufacturing, materials science, and green chemistry - offering a more sustainable, efficient, and recyclable approach to creating vital chemical structures.
