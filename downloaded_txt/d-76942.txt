why spend hours filling out award cards by hand when troopmaster can do it for you?
in a matter of minutes, troopmaster can produce hundreds of award cards with all of your scouts ranks and the merit badges they have earned on the court of honor report. each pack includes 800 award cards.
our award cards are produced using a standard 80 lb card stock which should print properly with almost all printers currently on the market. please check your printer specifications for more information.
note: since the actual badges your scouts may earn will vary, our perforated cards are not pre-printed. this allows the program to produce cards for any combination of awards earned by your scouts.
cards can also be used with the photo id cards report in our new troopmaster web 2.0.

this add-on product allows you to maintain a centralized database on a private ftp site assigned to your district. this provides all of the advantages of a "web enabled" system with no monthly fees. plus, you're in control! your database will be on an ftp site on our dedicated server, not on an insecure web site, so no one can access the site without having the proper passwords. also, the data on the site can be encrypted with a password that you define so that your data is fully protected, even if someone intercepts the file upload or hacks into your site.
to further enhance security, we now provide a free ftp site on our server. having your ftp site on our server also facilitates user support in the event that you are having difficulty accessing your site.
