welcome to broadcaster.org.uk
there are a variety of things on this website, from articles on self-help for people with emotional or relationship problems, to interviews with people about how they cope with problems that you can actually hear, to links to information about scam artists and the like, warning people of what to beware of and how to avoid being conned, to bible topics, to humour.

read most of the bible in four months on this website!
would you like to read the bible easily because it's laid out according to topic? if you read just one of our web pages of bible quotes a day, you can read nearly the whole bible in four months!
having said that, unless you've got a specific reason to want to know what it all says, a better thing to do is to read the most important bits of the bible regularly, mainly the bits on the way christians ought to live, since it's common to need reminders of what the highest ideals are, and actually, most of the old testament is almost utterly irrelevant for christians, and contains a lot of nasty gruesome bits it can be best to avoid. anyone who really wants to know more about them can visit articles such as these:
an attempt to explain gruesome bible passages.
the severity of some of the old testament laws and their relevance for christians.
this site includes information that explains some things in the bible that some people find problematic and links to answers to critics of the bible and christianity. 
if you're feeling a bit depressed, you may find some of the content on some of the pages in section 2 like those quite upsetting or too complex to concentrate on. it's normal to find it difficult to concentrate when depressed and it should pass; but if you're feeling like that, it might be best to visit the self-help articles in section 1 first.
the bible passages here have been put together in such a way as to make it easy to find out more-or-less everything the bible says about important topics and others, so people can quickly inform themselves more about it. where teaching on particular subjects is in several different parts of the bible so you might never find some of it, i've put it all together in one place. i've used modern translations, so the quotations will not be full of words that will be out-dated or hard to understand. i have not added anybody's personal theological opinion to most of the pages made up of bible quotes. i put the bible passages together so people can easily find out what the bible says, - people who might otherwise be misled by inaccurate teaching or who don't realise how much the new testament says about everyday situations, or who've never been motivated to read it much in the past and so don't know how interesting it is. this section is also aimed at people who may not have the chance to read a bible themselves, as they live where christianity is illegal and thus bibles are not freely available. --- diana holbourn, site owner
