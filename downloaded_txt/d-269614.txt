the nance family has been in the restaurant 
business since 1988. the texas roadhouse grill was 
opened in 1993 by john nance, sr., john jr., and david 
nance, whose vision was to provide fresh hand-cut 
steaks and seafood, at an affordable price. the nance 
family is one of the original families of myrtle beach and 
john and davidâs grandfather, mr. daniel wayne nance 
served on the committee that successfully incorporated 
the city of myrtle beach. a park, located in central myrtle 
beach, has been dedicated to the nance family for their 
contributions to the cityâs early civic, business and 
religious growth.
john jr. passed away in 2004. in 2008 his brother david 
relocated the texas roadhouse grill to its current 
location in the log cabin at the coastal grand mall. 
david continued his brotherâs vision of providing quality 
hand-cut steaks and the best seafood available at highly 
competitive prices even as the large chains have 
engulfed the grand strand area.
