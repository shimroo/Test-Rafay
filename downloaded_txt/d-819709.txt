siberian chaga mushroom (inonotus obliquus)

he could think of no greater pleasure than to go off into the woods for months on end, to break off this chaga, crumble it, boil it over a campfire, drink it and feel as good as an animal. walking through the forest for months, knowing no other care than to get better! like a dog in search of a mysterious grass that will save him.

chaga - russia's priceless natural treasure
imagine endless birch forests stretching across the landscape, with delicate white trunks and vibrant green leaves lining the banks of rivers and streams. nowhere else in the world can you find such an abundance of birch trees as in russia. among these trees grows one of nature's most mysterious and health-promoting wonders: the chaga mushroom. this unique fungus, with its distinctive black, fissured appearance, has captivated the interest of people worldwide, particularly in china, japan, korea, and the united states, due to its remarkable health benefits.
the enigmatic chaga mushroom
chaga, often referred to in russia as "black birch mushroom," "birch lip," or "shulta," derives its name from the old slavic word "gaga," meaning "a lip." unlike any other mushroom, chaga develops from the inside of a birch tree trunk, emerging outward rather than growing on the bark. this intriguing growth pattern makes it easily distinguishable from other tree fungi.
birch trees: a symbol of russian nature
in russian culture, the birch tree is a symbol of the nation and is revered for its healing properties. every part of the birch tree—sap, leaves, buds, wood, bark, and chaga mushroom—is utilized in traditional folk medicine for its health benefits. the symbiotic relationship between chaga and birch trees enhances the mushroom's potent properties, making it a valuable natural remedy.
health benefits of chaga
the age of the birch tree plays a crucial role in the potency of the chaga mushroom. as chaga extracts nutrients from the tree over many years, older trees yield mushrooms with higher concentrations of biologically active substances. the best chaga hosts are betula pendula and betula pubescens, although chaga can eventually exhaust and kill very old birch trees, especially when multiple mushrooms grow on a single trunk.
for optimal health benefits, it is essential to use wild-grown chaga. cultivated chaga lacks the chromogenic complex and other bioactive compounds found in wild chaga. 
understanding the chromogenic complex
one of the key components that sets wild chaga apart is its chromogenic complex, a group of humic-like acids that contribute to its potent health benefits. the chromogenic complex includes a variety of naturally occurring organic substances that are essential for the mushroom's health-promoting properties. these humic-like acids have powerful antioxidant properties, helping to neutralize free radicals and support overall health. this complex is unique to wild chaga and cannot be replicated in cultivated versions of the mushroom.
wild chaga vs. cultivated chaga
the pictures below may help you distinguish between wild and cultivated chaga mushrooms. the wild chaga mushroom consists of three parts: the outer black layer called the sclerotium, the second part known as the fruiting body, and the third part, which is porous and soft. the conk of the chaga mushroom mainly consists of this yellowish and useless layer, which is important to remember when assessing quality.
more than 80% of the biologically active substances in the chaga mushroom are concentrated in the sclerotium and the fruiting body. artificially grown chaga lacks a fruiting body and has an extremely thin sclerotium layer. however, most manufacturers use the entire body of the mushroom to reduce costs and increase profit. we take a different approach, using only the two layers of chaga that are richest in beneficial substances. refer to the pictures below for a visual comparison.    








the three layers of a genuine wild chaga mushroom are clearly distinguishable. the sclerotium, the oldest layer, is the most beneficial for consumption. the light brown layer, known as the "transitional" layer, allows the sap and phytonutrients of the birch tree to pass through without leaving much residue, ultimately accumulating in the fruiting body and the sclerotium. over the life of the birch tree, these two layers gather phytonutrients, trace elements, chaga acids, and other biologically active compounds. this accumulation makes an older chaga mushroom potentially more potent than a younger one.

this chaga was likely grown artificially on a farm through fermentation. its sclerotium layer is very thin, and there is no visible fruiting body—just a yellow, porous, and useless substance.



 
there is a difference between raw chaga and chaga extract
chaga extract is significantly more potent than raw chaga (such as chaga tea). understanding this difference is crucial for maximizing the benefits of chaga. detailed information on the distinctions between raw chaga and chaga extract can be found in the following article.
