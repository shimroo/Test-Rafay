    welcome to island’s end

beach front, cottage style hotel on st. pete beach 
welcome to island’s end, an oasis of real peace and quiet where the crystal blue waters of the gulf of mexico and the intercoastal waterway surround your very own private hideaway at the southern most tip of historic pass-a-grille. as you stroll out to the end of our fishing dock, feel the tension melt away as you watch the dolphins swim lazily by. hunt for shells along the private beach or take a 30 second walk to the 5-mile long public beach and enjoy a leisurely swim. nothing blocks your view on the emerald bay as you experience the brilliant sunrises, and later enjoy the spectacular sunsets. at island’s end you’ll find the perfect combination of sand, sea, and sky creating a tranquil atmosphere of rustic charm among our gray weathered cottages.
