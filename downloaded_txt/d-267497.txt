what we do

the thermal loop

electrification
industry 4.0









the thermal loop

learn more



















the thermal loop
for watlow, the underlying concept behind everything we do is that of the thermal loop. every product we offer, and every project we work on, is ultimately about the creation and control of a thermal loop in an application. 
learn more













industries











heat treatment
energy and environmental technologies
life sciences




clinical equipment
semiconductor processing
foodservice equipment












electrification





















electrification
over 100 years ago, watlow began designing and manufacturing electric heating elements to replace steam in the shoe industry. we've been electrifying equipment and processes ever since. wherever thermal is critical, no one is better equipped to help you reach your energy transition goals. learn why leading companies partner with us.

industry 4.0





















the thermal loop & industry 4.0
industry 4.0 technology enables the capture and processing of data in real time, both where its generated and where it is needed, to implement effective improvements to industrial processes. capturing data, though, is not enough. the advantage watlow® brings to an industry 4.0 project are its thermal experts, who understand both the important role thermal loop systems play in key applications and industry 4.0 implementations.
