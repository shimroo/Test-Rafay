polish american historical association
the polish american historical association is a non-profit, tax-exempt, interdisciplinary organization devoted to the study of polish american history and culture. founded in 1942 as part of the polish institute of arts and sciences in america, paha became an autonomous scholarly society in 1948. as an affiliate of the american historical association, paha promotes research and publication of scholarly materials focused on polish american history and culture as part of the greater polish diaspora. paha publishes a scholarly peer-reviewed journal, polish american studies, and disseminates information about its activities via a newsletter, paha news blog, and a facebook group. membership is open to all individuals interested in the fields of polish american history and culture, and immigration studies.
in 2018, paha celebrated its 75th anniversary with a variety of exciting projects and publications, including a book about the organization's history, edited by prof. james pula, and a special project a history of polish americans and their experiences told through meaningful objects ("objects that speak" - a part of the paha website, edited by prof. anna muller). our most recent initiative is documenting the wartime diaspora through the world war ii memoirs project.
