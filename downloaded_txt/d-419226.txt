vh1 casting for i love new york season 2





if flavor flav can do it, why not new york? not content with 10 minutes of fame, new york is looking for those extra 5 to further prove andy warhol’s proclamation. actually he re-worded that in 79’.. lord knows what he’d do in the internet age.. “it’s the place where my prediction from the sixties finally came true: ‘in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes.’ i’m bored with that line. i never use it anymore. my new line is, ‘in fifteen minutes everybody will be famous.’”so new york is looking for another love - not sure what happened to tango.if anything the first season had the biggest collection of fruits and candy-asses you’d find in one room. new york places the blame on vh1 producers, this time she’s determined to have a bigger hand in the initial selection.. along with giving ‘the people’ their say in who wins the chance to make some ridiculous [hopefully memorable] tv moments.oh yeah, and find some love.new york is determined to find true love.so here’s what’s going to happen this time around: 5 contestants in her stable of studs for ilny2 will be picked by her fans.“i think my fans know who’s best for new york,” she says. “they better not @#%^ me over!”the votes are clicking at i love new york 2with a producer’s mind - here’s my five.umm.. haha.. i can’t do that. way too many bare-chested, ‘here’s my sexy look’ men floating on my monitor. click over.. have fun with it.
