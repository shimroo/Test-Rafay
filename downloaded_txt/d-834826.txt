latest from the iera


jan 2, 2025
2025 registration is open
registration for annual iera memberships is open.  please note a couple of important updates from the rules meeting.  the price of the annual membership has been increased to $35 for the year, and all races will be ama sanctioned.  this means any rider participating in more than 2 events would be best served by having an annual ama membership.  there is an ama day fee available for $20.  an ama number is not required for the iera registration, but must be provided at or before the first race.
for additional information please read the membership page linked in below.
one question that is frequently asked is whether a rider can get the same number as last year.  riders have until jan 31 to renew last year’s number.  if someone requests a number in january that was previously owned, they will get notified as such, and can get a temp number if desired.  on feb 1, any numbers not renewed are then available, and will be assigned to the first new requestor.
