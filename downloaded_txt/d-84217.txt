laurie jean & lana dale memorial moratorium



april 30, 2004 - across canada press conferences were held by the families and their supporters to demand an immediate stop for all chiropractic high neck manipulations. the chiropractic regulators across canada have failed to voluntarily halt this useless and dangerous procedure. there have been two inquests that found that the chiropractors were at fault. there have been numerous lawsuits over the years, and yet the procedures continue with the blessings of chiropractic associations and regulators. governments that cover chiropractic still pay for this procedure. the families are supported by pediatricians, neurologists, and other experts who have seen the chiropractic regulators dance around any thought of meaningful self-regulation.

the chiropractic
industry under
examinationpaul benedetti
wayne macphail
canadians visit chiropractors about thirty million times a year, and surveys show that patients are generally satisfied with them. but paul benedetti and wayne macphail have another opinion. their hard-hitting canoe.ca web site called spin doctors i & ii were instrumental in educating the public about the excesses of some chiropractors. this book took years to write, and it is a must read for anyone who plans to go for chiropractic treatment, or who pays for insurance that covers it.

anti-vaccine chiropractors set sails on stormy sea

it doesn't matter what chiropractic regulators say or do about anti-vaccine chiros. their hands-off policy when it comes to dealing with their own licensed health care professionals who defy their policies and codes of ethics has once again resulted in more letters to the editor, more flyers, more signs in their waiting rooms about the bad effects of vaccines. in ontario, a chiropractor who happens to be on the executive council of the cco claims to be a pediatric specialist and circulates anti-vaccine junk at health shows. even that is against their regulations. but, no one cares, do they?

ontario chiros - gizmos - gams and stilettos
would you go to see a chiropractor who would rent space at a major toronto hotel to promote vega metres, and sell you $400 blood tests for "food allergies" that have to be sent to the u.k? would you believe the pitch more if she showed up in a flashy mini skirt and stiletto heals? for more stories that will open you eyes about questionable chiropractic practices i suggest that you start here.


chiropractic crimes
chiropractors sometimes take advantage of their patients, sometimes they get in bed with the wrong people. in some areas of the u.s. many chiropractors have set up fronts for organized prostitution. why in the world does this happen, and how do the chiropractic regulators and the courts deal with it?

is chiropractic a religion, a philosophy or healing art. 
the roots of vitalistic chiropractic as envisioned by its founder d.d. palmer are alive and well today.

pediatric chiropractic scams

did you ever wonder if your hospital would allow a chiropractor into the delivery room? what subluxations do c. section babies have that needs to be addressed by chiropractors? do you shop for a chiropractor because they have nice toys in the waiting room, or pictures of the muppets hanging on the wall?

why do chiropractors hate murray katz?
when a montreal pediatrician goes to work he defends the weak, he educates the public, and he saves lives. so why do chiropractors and their supporters hate his guts?
