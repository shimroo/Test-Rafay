finding jewish books
there have been jewish books as long as there have been jews. the
  bible 
  itself refers to other books by name (but those haven't been preserved). 
  these days, there are thousands upon thousands of jewish books. the problem is 
  finding them and matching up the right jewish books with the right readers. 
  there is a sea of jewish knowledge out there in print, even or 
  especially in english, just waiting for you to come and get acquainted, from
  talmud to
  kosher cookbooks, from
  jewish dictionaries to
  news from israel. 

sechel and jewish literacy

  so, in our own small effort to promote jewish literacy, we've organized 
  jewish books into categories (with a little jewish sechel 
  - common sense) to help you find them, and added our own built-in searches to take you 
  straight to the right places on our affiliates' sites. the whole idea is to 
  get you and those jewish books together. maybe we should call this the jewish book 
  matchmaking service? then again, maybe not...

  you can 
  browse our categories on the side of your screen, where you'll also find short introductions to each 
  subject, our featured


  jewish books, and links to more jewish books.  
  oh, and while we really do love jewish books, we do also like 
  jewish software, jewish
  magazines and newspapers (including israeli 
  newspapers) and 
  jewish music very much, so you can find them here, too.

how to buy a good jewish book
the jewish book mall is unique on the web, bringing you quality jewish 
  books and seforim from multiple sources: amazon, artscroll, judaica press, 
  judaism, alljudaica, jewish software, all in one place. you can even use our 
  search tool to find used jewish books from thousands of independent 
  booksellers, in addition to new ones. plus, we offer jewish and israeli 
  posters and artwork from three different sources (allposters, art, and 
  barewalls). so, nu, how about a good jewish book 
  today?
