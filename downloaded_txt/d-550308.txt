why does “made flat, stays flat™" matter? our "guaranteed never to curl" recycled rubber flooring eliminates the many risks associated with lifting, curling, and chipping floor tiles. by finishing our “made flat, stays flat™" tiles with water-jet cut precision edges, we create a virtually seamless floor and help ensure a smooth and successful installation. this means safer spaces, lower maintenance, and a floor that will look better, longer. 








have a custom idea? 

welcome to dinoflex’s digital do-it-yourself method of designing your very own custom color. the color innovator uses a simple, yet innovative process divided into three steps; pick your colors, choose the ratios, and mix! you have diverse colors to choose from and engineer into your own personal swatch. the final sample can be saved digitally via email or can be made into a tactile sample tile.
