testimonialsit is such a sincere pleasure working with you and your team. everyone goes above and beyond to offer outstanding service and products. i honestly do not know what i would do without solid image!tom mccallum, mccallum cabinets, inc.we just wanted to let you know how pleased we are with solid image and the installation of our granite countertop. your installers (jeremiah, jeff & kevin) were meticulous and we couldn’t be happier. it looks great. joan & sal cassarai was totally impressed with your company, the communication, the service, the attention to detail, the product, the measurement process and most of all — the installation and results.jeanneit was a pleasure to work with you, i am very pleased with the job your company has done for me. i am thinking of posting a picture of my new bathrooms on e-neighbors (our community site) to show everybody what good work you’ve done. i will highly recommend your company to anyone that needs to redo their countertops.lorenaour kitchen is finally complete and it is simply stunning. the microwave and oak breakfast bar trim went in yesterday. i really appreciated that your installers were dedicated professional craftsmen who took pride in doing a superb job – and it wasn’t all easy. they took their time until things were perfect. the granite itself was well-milled and polished. you and bob yankee did a job worthy of my son-in-law — and that is saying a lot! glen is a high-priced, but sought-after perfectionist of a contractor in new england. i would recommend you and bob (cabinet guy) with confidence to anyone. i do love the pattern. the swirls are beautiful and preparing a meal, which i enjoy doing, is relaxing as well as pleasurable.nancy & jack gomes×we'd love to hear from you!
