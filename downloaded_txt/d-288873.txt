the ozarks studies institute, an initiative of the missouri state university libraries, seeks to preserve the heritage of the ozarks, its culture, environment and history
                           by fostering a comprehensive knowledge of ozarks' peoples, places, characteristics
                           and dynamics. the institute promotes a sense of place for residents and visitors alike
                           and serves as an educational resource by collecting existing and discovering new knowledge
                           about the ozarks and by providing access to that knowledge.
our activities

using traditional, innovative and emerging technologies to preserve and present the
                              ozarks' heritage. 
sponsoring speakers, professional conferences and workshops.
developing multi-disciplinary programs with the purpose of fostering an appreciation
                              of the beauty and complexity of the ozarks.
encouraging scholarly research focusing on the ozarks.
being an educational resource, particularly for the region's elementary and secondary
                              schools.
collaborating with partners from outside the university including other institutions
                              focusing on the ozarks such as folk-life centers, museums, historical and cultural
                              societies and other universities and colleges.
making related collections at the university (i.e., lederer collection of african-american heritage in the ozarks, ozarks labor union archives, max hunter folk song collection, mccann ozarks folk music collection) more visible and accessible.

our role
a comprehensive view of the ozarks is enhanced through a multi-disciplinary, university-wide
                           effort. nearly all academic departments and colleges have some role to play in improving
                           our understanding of the ozarks, ranging from the natural and built environments,
                           to performance and visual arts, to history, folklore, economics, politics, and religion.
                           the institute enables the university to focus its programs relating to the ozarks,
                           serve as a clearinghouse for knowledge of and about the ozarks, and promote scholarly
                           activities that increase our understanding of the ozarks.
