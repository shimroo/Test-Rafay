public wildlands







in 1992 a group of citizens concerned about logging, mining, and off-road vehicles got together to protect the daniel boone national forest.
over 30 years later, weâre still working to protect our public land in kentucky through science-based, grassroots advocacy!

rivers &  streams






kentucky waterways provide critical habitat for various plant and animal species and offer recreational opportunities such as fishing, kayaking, and swimming.


















forests &  fungi






forests cover about 31% of the earth's land area and play a crucial role in sequestering carbon, maintaining biodiversity, and regulating our climate.
