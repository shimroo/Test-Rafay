if i was a serial killer i would be  ted bundy. in the early to mid 1970s ted bundy would murder over 30 young women. most were attacked while walking in parks, found later to have been raped and strangled to death, but sometimes bundy would go as far as breaking into their houses as they slept and beating them to death with a crow bar.after being caught and convicted of the murders, bundy accepted prison, acquired a new name and started his killing spree all over again. soon after, bundy was caught, but not before taking the lives of 3 more women.almost all of bundy's victims were young white girls with long dark hair parted down the middle, all were raped, beaten and sodomized. kill count: 30+find what serial killer you would be, take the serial killer quiz now!you like the mohawk or liberty spikes!!!!!!!! yourock thats what i have. witch hair style would you have. brought to you by quizilla
