				glory days by alex askaroff



				see alex askaroff talking about glory days
the sewalot site is run by alex askaroff. the
                        enterprise was founded on service, quality and genuine
                        enthusiasm for sewing machines. alex is a long term member of
                        the guild of master craftsmen. 
alex grew up in
                        the sewing industry and as a teenager undertook
                        a four- year engineering course, qualifying in 1976, 
                        yeah he's no spring chicken.
                        after qualifying he was trained by further experts 
                        from jaeger and the sewing trade 
                        then spent 10 years on the factory floor
                        at the family firm before founding his own business.

                        alex has around 35,000 customers in his area from 
                        schools to businesses, factories to farms, hotels to 
                        hospitals, just about 
                        anywhere there are sewing machines, from boot-patchers 
                        to sailmakers, plus all those happy quilters and patchworkers.
one of
                        alex's hobbies has always been collecting 
                        early sewing machines
                        after trying to rescue six from a skip as a child. he now
                        owns one of the finest collections of 
                        early 19th century machines. 
						alex has also carried on the family tradition of writing 
						children's classics first started by james planché and 
						matilda mackarness his 19th century grandparents.



set in the black hills of ireland 
						where the pixies still play with the leprechaun's, the 
						tale of gizzleink is a classic for all ages.
						warning suitable for 
						kids who love to laugh!

through popular request 
                        (okay pestering over many years) many of

                        sewing books. they are much in the same theme as james
                        herriot on his travels around the yorkshire dales. 
                        they
                        have sold in there thousands all over the world.

i love your stories... so beautifully

						observation.  the fact that you tell it "like it is"

alex, in a sea of bland, 
                        boring sewing machine websites, 
                        sewalot stands head and shoulders above 
                        the rest, with real stories, 
                        history, information and tales.
keep it up.  regards

                        expecting to find the typical, sterile, format and 
                        instead found your art. what a wonderful surprise.

isaac 
				singer
				the first capitalist



most of us know the name singer but few are aware of 
		his amazing life story, his rags to riches journey from a little runaway 
		to one of the richest men of his age. the story of isaac merritt singer 
		will blow your mind, his wives and lovers his castles and palaces all 
		built on the back of one of the greatest inventions of the 19th century. 
		for the first time the most complete story of a forgotten giant is 
		brought to you by alex askaroff.


                dear alex,  

                i'd like to say what a wonderful website you have. it's full of 
                beautiful pictures and photographs and all kinds of juicy 
                information! it holds a lot more information than most of the 
                other sewing-machine websites/blogs out there and covers so many 
                more things in greater detail.

sometime ago i came across alex askaroffs website
		sewalot. i think it is 
		the best sewing machine website ive seen. alex has an obvious passion 
		for sewing machines, especially of the antique variety.
 one word of warning alex has filled every page with so 
		many interesting gems of information  viewing his site becomes an 
		addiction!!!

			alex,
			i read your site.  yes, the whole thing, every page in your index 
			and some pages twice!  i have also watched your youtube videos.  i 
			just might have to become a collector!

alex: i love all your pages and i have seen them many 
		times. i wish you were in the usa as i would love to see your 
		collection. i also loved your youtube for the 
		w&g and will continue to see some of the others. i'm sure they will be 
		as perfect as those on your site. thanks for 
		passing on such information to those like me that love older things, not 
		only sewing machines.
