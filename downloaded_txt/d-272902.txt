march 13, 2022							                            comments off on how cryptocurrencies affect the travel industry 


the travel industry is experiencing the tremendous impact of cryptocurrencies. today, many people want to travel and pay their expenses with bitcoin and other virtual currencies. here’s how digital currencies affect the travel sector. 
secure payments 
many travel agents and companies are now accepting the new currency. one can now book their flight using different cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. paying for your flight with cryptocurrency lowers the cost of conversion and transaction. it’s also fraud-free.
blockchain technology validates cryptocurrency transactions. and this makes them more secure than debit or credit cards since they do not need 3rd party verification. travelers’ payment information is stored in their crypto wallets and recorded in a decentralized ledger.
managing and tracking of luggage is assured
the technology used in cryptocurrencies is precious in protecting passenger information since it helps companies bypass 3rd party vendors.
cryptocurrencies’ decentralized systems make accessing transaction data straightforward for travel companies. ideally, anybody in the blockchain can confirm transaction details before providing a service. 
better data security
blockchain provides a secure data protection technology. its encrypted nature makes it possible to validate transactions without personally identifying information, such as the customers’ names and email addresses.
with crypto, you don’t have to worry about the safety of your money and data since you can travel to any place without losing your personal information.
loyalty program
many travel agencies and companies have loyalty programs where customers get rewards and discounts for paying with cryptocurrencies. travel companies can use blockchain technology in loyalty programs. and these programs help these companies to retain customers while attracting others.
parting shot
cryptocurrencies use blockchain and cryptography. people or computers called miners solve math puzzles to generate new digital coins.
and this shows that cryptocurrency is safe and secure hence trusted by the travel industry operators and travelers. the chances are that many sectors will embrace cryptocurrency in the next few years.

fascinating facts about travel

january 2, 2019							                            comments off on fascinating facts about travel 


before you set off on a trip and probably switch off your devices to focus on unwinding and enjoying the experience, you should have a look at some facts about travel. after having a long talk with a travel pal of mine by the name of austin that travels a lot thanks to his success shared with us. here are some of the facts he shared about traveling that you will find truly fascinating: 
jet lag has the worst feeling when traveling from west to east 
the human’s internal clock has a natural sleep/wake modes cycle that is slightly longer than 24 hours. when you travel from east to west, the day becomes shorter. when you travel from east to west, the day becomes longer thereby making adapting easier for your brain. 
novelty remembrance 
naturally, the brain is made to recall novelty. therefore, to remember a vacation longer, include a dramatic scenery exchange in the middle. stop sizzling on a beach and go on a boat trip out of waters. consider spending a day in the mountains to make the experience better and memorable. 
it’s normal to forget people’s names 
when traveling abroad, you are likely to forget people’s names a few seconds after the introduction. that doesn’t mean you are stupid or rude. it’s because the introduction happens at a time when your focus is elsewhere, and that’s on making an awesome first impression. to avoid forgetting the name of a person, use it immediately after the introduction. 
you enjoy travel better when you spend money on experiences 
instead of spending money buying items, spend it on experiences. experiences provide a reason for waiting in anticipation. they provide memories to remember after the trip. additionally, experiences are sharp and short. that means you do not have sufficient time for adapting to the happenings and even normalize the mind. this is what happens after purchasing an item. 
the best part of a trip is actually not the trip itself. it’s the anticipation of being away from home. however, you make the experience better when your spend time away doing things that make you happier.
