welcome to the pennsylvania aaa federation website

the pennsylvania aaa federation was formed as the pennsylvania motor federation by six automobile clubs, encompassing 750 members, on march 1, 1906 in philadelphia. the purpose of the federation was to secure organized action from motorists around the state in order to promote the enactment of reasonable motor vehicle laws and secure a system of improved state highways. in 1907, the federation became the pennsylvania division of the american automobile association and expanded its good roads campaign to pass national legislation like the federal highway act. for more than 50 years, we have provided messenger services for aaa club member/non-member driver license and motor vehicle transactions that are submitted to the pennsylvania department of transportation (penndot) for processing. we provide education to aaa club staff members who complete driver license and motor vehicle transactions and are an approved penndot agent service trainer. we offer classroom agent service training at our facility in harrisburg, pa or on-line basic or advanced agent service training on our website.
