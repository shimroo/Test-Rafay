what is google translate?
google translate is a third-party service provided by google that performs all translations directly and dynamically. by detecting patterns in documents that have already been translated by human translators, google translate can make intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should be. this process of seeking patterns in large amounts of text is called “statistical machine translation”. since the translations are generated by machines, not all translation will be perfect. the more human-translated documents that google translate can analyze in a specific language, the better the translation quality will be. this is why translation accuracy will vary across languages.
disclaimer
the virginia information technologies agency (vita) website is providing the “google translate” option to assist you in reading the website in languages other than english. for these translations, reasonable efforts have been made to provide an accurate translation, however, no automated translation is perfect nor is it intended to replace human translators. these translations are provided as a service to users of the vita website, and are provided "as is." no warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, is made as to the accuracy, reliability, or correctness of any of these translations made from english into any other language. some content (such as images, videos, flash, etc.) may not be accurately translated due to the limitations of the translation software.
any discrepancies or differences created in translating this content from english into another language are not binding and have no legal effect for compliance, enforcement, or any other purpose. if any questions arise related to the accuracy of the information contained in these translations, please refer to the english version of the website.
