henry
drummond  

 
(1851-1897)


      








author of the multi-million selling
inspirational
meditation 

"the greatest thing in the world"






 

who was henry
drummond?....born
in scotland in 1851, he was a man of varied talents. perhaps best
remembered
as a gifted evangelist who assisted dwight l. moody during his revival
campaigns, he was also a lecturer in natural science.  although he never received a degree, he was an
ordained
minister and a professor of theology. he also wrote several books.
"natural
law in the spiritual world", published in 1883, sold 70,000 copies
in five years and made him famous. he published another popular book,
"tropical
africa", after making a geological survey of southern africa. "the
ascent of man" was also a significant book during his lifetime.


however, "the greatest thing in the world" -
a meditation he wrote in 1874 that illuminates the importance of 1
corinthians
13 - is the one that assured he would be remembered by later
generations.
widely read and quoted during his lifetime, it went on to sell over 12
million copies and it continues today to influence people to follow
god's
two great commandments: to love god and to love each other.
