what ourmembers say




what ourmembers say
i have been a member of the cvhba for 20 years. to me the most important part of my membership is the advocating the association does for their members. the cvhba is fighting to help the builders and sub-contractors with the common problems that are impacting businesses in these trying times. in addition, having the opportunity to network with other members strengthens our relationships and we believe in members using members for business whenever they can.

what ourmembers say
the home builders association has helped my business so much. from helping to find a subcontractor to legal advice... without the association i would’ve been out of resources to try and further my business throughout the past years.

what ourmembers say
being a member of the cvhba has proven to be a solid pillar for our business.  the association provides us opportunities to engage with our community and network with other members.  we enjoy interacting with the attendees at the annual home show and jump at the chance to present at educational seminars hosted by the cvhba.  the home builders association makes it easy for us to be involved in many aspects of the building industry including workforce development, government affairs, and volunteering opportunities to name a few.

selective countertops has been a member since 2013, and the chippewa valley home builders association has really transformed our business.  there are so many benefits available through the association.  we found the marketing and networking opportunities are just what we needed to get us recognized within the community and with other businesses.  if you aren’t already a member we would highly recommend joining and see for yourself what it can do for your company.

what ourmembers say
being a member of the cvhba has given our business a competitive edge by providing us access to the parade of homes and the home show.  our business has grown significantly from the exposure that these two events have provided. being a member has also been great for networking and building relationships with people and businesses that surround the housing industry in the chippewa valley.  i give credit to lyman lumber for encouraging me to become a member and would give the same advice to anyone that is considering joining.

what ourmembers say
the chippewa valley home builders association has been a great resource for my company for over 30 years. i’ve met many fellow builders, subcontractors and suppliers that have shared their insight on how make your company successful. in recent years, i have been attending the cvhba contractor conference which is an easy way to get the education credits needed to keep my building credentials current. i especially love the networking opportunities at the ‘builder after hours’ meetings.
