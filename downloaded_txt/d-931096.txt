in 2020, artist bobby forsythe created supporting the arts, a collective dedicated to helping fellow artists and art hobbyists affected by the covid-19 pandemic. many were struggling financially and had lost motivation to create. forsythe wanted to help in any way possible and thus created a platform to establish a supportive artist community.the collective's primary objective is to support emerging and professional artists, as well as art hobbyists, by organising online annual exhibitions that award cash prizes. supporting the arts aims to open a gallery in the future to host local and international shows, thus expanding their reach.
