wild stories from the history of bird migration research



feb 26, 2025




we've all heard amazing facts about bird migration—the long distances that birds travel, the ways that they navigate, etc. but did you ever wonder how we figured all of this out? while working for the american ornithological society, rebecca heisman became fascinated with the varied and creative techniques that scientists have used to study bird migration, and this eventually became the basis for her book flight paths: how a passionate and quirky group of pioneering scientists solved the mystery of birdmigration. in her talk, she'll share some surprising stories from the history of bird migration research and discuss why understanding migration is so crucial for bird conservation.rebecca heisman is an award-winning science writer who lives in walla walla, washington, and has worked with organizations including the audubon society, the american bird conservancy, the cornell lab of ornithology, and the american ornithological society. flight paths is her first book.register to get zoom link.

bird-friendly maple



mar 26, 2025




details coaudubon's bird-friendly maple program recognizes maple producers and sugarbush managers who commit to managing their forest for bird habitat value alongside sap production. through this work, these land managers help improve habitat for many species of birds who depend on our forests for breeding and migratory stopover habitat, and whose populations have been declining. the bird-friendly maple program began in vermont, has been steadily expanding into more states, and currently includes 8 sugarbushes across nearly 100 acres of forest in connecticut. in this webinar, we will cover the basics of bird-friendly maple, what ideal sugarbush habitat looks like, and how this program contributes to audubon's overall forest work.rosa goldman (she/her) is a forest program senior associate with audubon connecticut and new york, a regional office of the national audubon society. as part of audubon's healthy forests team, she works with private landowners, land trusts, and state and conservation partners to advance habitat management for forest birds across connecticut, as well as in new york's hudson valley. rosa manages audubon's bird-friendly maple and forester training & endorsement programs in connecticut. she is a licensed forester in connecticut and holds a master of forestry degree from the yale school of the environment.ming soon.register to get zoom link.
