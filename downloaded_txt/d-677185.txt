carol steioff





craig and wheeler realty & auction was so very helpful when we purchased our commercial lot. they went the “extra mile” to make sure that everything was handled accurately, explaining each and every detail in our transaction. from the restrictions, surveying, site maps, they are a team of true professionals. i would highly recommend their company to everyone!









james randall crowell





i have found craig & wheeler realty & auction to be of the highest esteem and very attentive to the smallest of details when it comes to selling your personal items and property. attention to detail in this day and time is where the rubber meets the road and craig & wheeler meets this criteria.









joe and cherie poropatich





when my wife and i inherited a historic home in tennessee, our attorney recommended craig & wheeler to handle the sale of the house, land and contents. our agent suggested we hold an auction. as we were living in southern california, he said he could handle all aspects of the auction, which included extensive marketing, cataloging contents, cleaning and preparing the house and property. the auction was a huge success exceeding our expectations and we owe it all to craig & wheeler.









kathy & larry bice





it was a pleasure working with the friendly and courteous staff at craig & wheeler. we found them to be knowledgeable and detail-oriented professionals. they found us the house that fit our wants and needs and the sale went through without a hitch. we would most definitely work with craig & wheeler for any future real estate needs.
