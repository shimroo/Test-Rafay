with you throughout life’s journey…














“anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. when we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. the people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.”~ fred rogers
























welcome to the antioch group
many of us at some point in our lives encounter an emotional or relational problem that we can’t just “work out” by ourselves.we find ourselves in a great deal of pain—and we need healing. healing for a broken relationship, an aching heart, or a lost dream. healing for painful and poisonous thoughts and ideas. and, sometimes, in order to find that healing, we need the support and guidance of a professional.at the antioch group, our christian world view allows us to work with people from an “open arms” perspective—rather than a perspective of “us versus them.”as a group, we are committed totreating our clients with respect in a quiet, caring, and confidential environmentguiding people through the therapy experience as efficiently as possible, without sacrificing the quality of their recoveryproviding our clients with quality after-care options to maximize their investment and to prevent recurrences


























what our clients say about us:
“these sessions have helped bring me to a new understanding of my faith, my past, and my future…so grateful”“i had no idea how helpful and needed these services were to my life. i am a better person today than i was when i started services here.”“i am so grateful for the professional care and empathy shown to me during the therapeutic process…i can’t say enough about the kindness that is shown to people in need…you are truly doing the work of god here”“i have experienced a lot of mental health services throughout my life and no one has even come close to treating me with the respect, dignity, and true love of jesus as the staff (here) and my therapist. thank you for treating your patients and their families like real people. god bless you!”“the antioch group has been a safe haven for me. a warm, inviting place to deal with my pain and sorrow. thank you from the bottom of my heart for your care and compassion.”
