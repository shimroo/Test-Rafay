story 1​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​broward county gis conducts geographic spatial analysis and mapping services while providing enterprise-wide governance for gis, including establishing and maintaining standards and infrastructure for gis within broward county government. the gis group is available to provide gis support to other county agencies that do not have these capabilities and to serve as liaison between county agencies and gis consultants.

broward county gis is also responsible for coordinating and conducting the gis users group, which typically meets the last wednesday of each month. the users group is a forum for networking between gis users across the county and south florida, providing access to training and the latest technology within the field.​

what is gis?a geographic information system (gis) integrates hardware, software, and data for capturing, managing, analyzing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information. gis allows us to view, understand, question, interpret, and visualize data in many ways that reveal relationships, patterns, and trends in the form of maps, globes, reports, and charts.

accessibilitybroward county’s geographic information systems group focuses on continuous system improvement to accommodate all individuals who visit our web maps. geospatial related maps and data, in particular, pose challenges to full accessibility as governed by the americans with disabilities act (ada). this is due to the current design limitations of geographic information systems (gis) software. if you use assistive technology and the format of these pages prevents you from obtaining necessary data, please contact us via email at
