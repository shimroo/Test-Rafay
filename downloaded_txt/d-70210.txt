our mission 



to build a better future for the black community in ontario and canada, it is critical to first acknowledge and understand all that has happened until this point. if not for the countless black trailblazers who helped shape our country, things like black history month and ontario black history society may never have existed. therefore, it is imperative that we not only remember these men and women, but celebrate them as well.
