northwest solutions for northwest customers















market transformation in action: extended motor products
engaging midstream influencers
in this video market transformation manager, nick michel, c.e.m, discusses the midstream market interventions that play a pivotal role in market transformation. one of the key strategies employed by the extended motor products (xmp) program is to work with distributors and manufacturer representatives. these partners, who are influential decision-makers in the marketplace, help the program reach more customers effectively than through direct, one-on-one engagements. this midstream approach not only broadens the reach but also makes the program's goals more attainable by fostering strong engagement with a wide range of stakeholders in the commercial and industrial sectors.by focusing on improving pump efficiency and midstream interventions, neea's xmp program aims to save around 6.2 terawatt hours of energy over an 11-year period, starting in 2020.

recognizing a decade of regional accomplishments, innovation and leadership
2024 leadership in energy efficiency awards

success story: heat pump water heaters
alliance plays a key role in u.s. doe's new landmark energy efficiency standard
on april 30, the u.s. doe published the new federal efficiency standard for consumer water heaters. the new federal standard will transition the majority of electric storage water heaters to heat pump technology and make important incremental steps to improve gas storage water heater efficiency. the passage of the federal water heating standard represents a major milestone in alliance market transformation efforts and is a win for all northwest gas and electric customers. it is a direct result of nearly 20 years of leadership by the alliance, its market partners, and many stakeholders across the country.
