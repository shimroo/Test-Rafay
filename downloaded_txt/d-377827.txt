with my interdisciplinary training in social and natural sciences at the university of california, davis, i am interested in human social organization, and how a variety of forces influence patterns of cooperation and conflict. i conducted research in tanzania, east africa to investigate how culture influences cooperation.  i also have conducted numerous experiments in the area of behavioral economics to understand altruism, fairness, and cooperation.  my teaching experience was diverse: criminology, social psychology, statistics, anthropology, and conflict studies. most of my work has a foundation in cultural evolutionary theory developed by peter richerson.   after an exciting academic career, i shifted my energy to applied efforts: data science, and medical/technical writing.  visit my consulting site at www.data-decide.com       resume                                                            bmpaciotti@gmail.com                                                            530-219-8306
