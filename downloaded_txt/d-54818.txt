your exclusive opportunity to purchase  the physical poster and digiital (nft) of led zeppelin history.  this is a one-of-a-kind piece that can be monetized by licensed poster and nft smart contract reproduction.






to the elite and discerning led zeppelin collector/investor, we offer the opportunity to purchase a true one of a kind piece of led zeppelin history.
we have created a copyrighted piece of media art that chronicles the 30 year odyssey via unique images of the journey to sell 80,000 tickets to the concert that was not to be.
the last show the original band would ever puton sale, cancelled due to the untimely death of drummer john bonham on sept. 25th 1980, the very day the tickets were to be sold by mail order only via newspaper ad.
this richly documented saga is prominently disseminated on the web site. click on link below. photo shown by jim summaria

nft smart contracts are like special digital rule books for unique digital items. let’s break it down:
what is an nft?
an nft is a one-of-a-kind digital thing, like a special picture or video on the internet that a person can own. it’s like having the original copy of a rare trading card.
what is a smart contract?
a smart contract is like a robot helper that follows rules. it automatically does certain things when specific conditions are met.
how do nft smart contracts work?
when you put these two ideas together, an nft smart contract is like a digital robot assistant that:

keeps track of who owns the special digital item
makes sure only one person can own it at a time
helps people buy and sell the item safely

here’s a fun way to think about it: imagine you have a magical sticker book. each sticker is unique and can only be in one place at a time. the smart contract is like a friendly robot librarian who:

watches over the sticker book
knows which page each sticker is on
helps people trade stickers fairly
makes sure no one can cheat by copying stickers

the robot librarian (smart contract) uses a special computer network called a blockchain to keep everything organized and secure
so when someone wants to buy or sell an nft, the smart contract robot helper makes sure everything happens correctly and updates the records automatically.

@metropulseusa

the last tweet posted on @metropulseusa twitter account the day before it was shut down.




a poignant reminder we stand up for what we believe in..


we lost our flagship, the very successful platform on the pre musk twitter (now x) @metropulseusa and defiantly posted the archived tweet sequence and culmination of the grossy unfair and continuing suspension on the home page of this site. now sweet vindication..have faith we take a stand when we believe what’s right and are not afraid to pay the price when we do. pure true independent media you can trust..
