your guide to dog health problems & treatment options






as all pet owners will agree, dog health problems deserve the same attention that we give to our own health issues.  dogs face the same illnesses as we do, such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis and even depression, in addition to unique conditions such as kennel cough and heartworm.
recent research shows that there are natural pet care treatments that can effectively combat many of these painful conditions.  oftentimes, a  combination of conventional and holistic dog treatments is the best solution.at dogpro.com, we will explore the ins and out of canine health, with an in-depth look at problems, symptoms, treatment, common questions and much more.
we will discuss the latest developments in pet health care, from new prescription medications to natural treatments to dietary and nutritional concerns.
