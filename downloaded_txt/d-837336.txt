my ear was really blocked and i couldn't hear anything. i tried this and 3 days later my hearing was back. i'm still using it to finish the job completely. you know it's working when you hear the popping noises going on in your ear. great stuff.”

amazon customer
5 stars



otex express ear drops
“great ear drops
these are the best ones i've tried. just a few drops and it crackles and pops in your ear, clearing everything out. sometimes takes a couple of applications and blocks the ear up even more. but then completely clears everything. highly recommend”
