american sabbatical
peggy had a sabbatical in 1996-97 to visit historic sites. the muirs sent daily e-dispatches from the road to a widening circle of correspondents. they also drew, painted, and took photographs of the sights. now their complete illustrated road journal has been posted to their american sabbatical web site. come for a ride across america.
