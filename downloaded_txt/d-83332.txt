message from the president 



thank you for taking the time to visit the fraternal order of police associates (fopa) in jacksonville, florida. the fopa is an organization formed for the purpose of increasing our understanding of the rights, duties and problems of law enforcement officers; of fostering respect for them; and of bettering conditions under which they serve society. our local fopa was founded by volunteer police officers known as reserve police officers. these community minded citizens volunteer their time in an effort to make our city a safer place for our families. these officers have joined together with local businesses and concerned citizens in an effort to increase public awareness of the mission of law enforcement.the events of 9/11/2001 showcased the peril our law enforcement officers contend with at any given moment and further showed the impact citizen involvement made in response to the tragedy.join us at our regularly scheduled meetings on the 4th monday of every month.meetings include dinner and guest speakers from the law enforcement community. a business meeting is then held where new plans and ideas are developed with our membership.thank you,paul davispresident fopa-530
