my first dealings with the company was thirty years ago. they made a mattress for a small double bed. so comfy to sleep on. over fifteen years ago i made a timber and iron bed. again i sought out the sandman mattress and a latex topper. they even recovered the latex topper when i accidentally got it wet. i think you couldn’t go wrong. buy local and not imported. the mattress is to die for.

we needed a new mattress after our previous, and very expensive, mattress didn’t last very well at all. jess at the grovedale store was a delight to deal with. she showed great expertise and patience, and helped us choose a great mattress – and at a great price. if you want to buy with confidence, i’d recommend you visit jess at the sandman mattress factory in grovedale. thanks jess!
