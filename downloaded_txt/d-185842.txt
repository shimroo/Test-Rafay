quote of the day....

"one man's meat is another man's poison"....... not if you know how to cook it with good asian home recipes.



unique asia

although it's been around for thousand of years, asian food is suddenly the smart new food. restaurant chefs from the east to west are introducing
      asian ingredients and cooking techniques into their repertoire, suburban greengrocers and supermarkets are stocking fresh coriander and lemon grass, full of flavor, and never boring or
      bland.  today many of the herbs, spices, vegetables and other items needed to create authentic asian dishes are readily available, often in local supermarkets. the more unusual
      ingredients can be found in asian food stores. with its emphasis on grains and vegetables, it is also healthy, cheap and often quick to prepare. yet it's dangerous to generalize. 

asian food is a multi-faceted and diverse as european food. while neighbors share some common ingredients and cooking styles, asian countries have developed
      cuisines that are uniquely their own. sampling the food of each is truly an adventure.
