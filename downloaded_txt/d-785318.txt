“douglas county views its partnership with the kansas land trust as a chance to ensure that future generations remain connected to conserved areas and benefit from the mutually rewarding relationship with the land,” says kaitlyn ammerlaan, heritage conservation coordinator for douglas county, kansas. in this exciting pilot program, klt will work closely with ammerlaan and other douglas county staff on at least two voluntary conservation projects that provide significant public benefit. interested landowners should review all program materials and submit a complete application no later than february 28, 2025. the kansas land trust will host all application and program materials on its website and the klt board of directors will approve eligible projects in march. kaitlin stanley, executive director of klt told the lawrence journal world, “ i am delighted to enter this partnership because community-centered conservation is at the core of the kansas land trust’s recently completed strategic conservation plan, which will guide klt’s future work.”
