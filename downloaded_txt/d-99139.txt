 roots tracer november 2023 issue









we welcome you to the website of the livermore-amador genealogical society (l-ags). genealogy - also known as family history research - is a worldwide hobby pursuit. our society serves the tri-valley cities of livermore, pleasanton and dublin in the southeastern portion of alameda county, in the beautiful san francisco bay area of california.

l-ags was founded in 1977. we cordially help people of all skill levels to improve their knowledge and understanding of their ancestors and their connections to historical events. although our name says livermore-amador, our members provide expertise in nearly all aspects of family history exploration from 17th-century colonization through research of twentieth-century immigration from all ancestral continents.

our organization has extracted many cemetery, church, census and other records about the tri-valley and they are available for viewing either in published books or in free, online databases. you are welcome to browse these records by clicking on the "local records" or "publications" buttons on the left. current and past 
issues of our societies quarterly publication, "the roots tracer", can also be viewed by clicking on a button. we also have expert genealogists on staff who can help you trace your family history.
