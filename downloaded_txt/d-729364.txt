overview
for 240+ countries and territories, ensure your packages arrive, no matter where your customers are located or in what language their addresses are written.
















worldwide address verification
informatica’s address verification is the only service that combines postal certifications in one engine from all six global postal organizations: usps, canada post, la poste in france, new zealand post, australia post, and eircode in ireland. it’s able to parse, analyze, verify, correct, and format addresses according to local postal standards—ensuring that correct elements appear in the appropriate hierarchical alignment. only with the right address format can you be sure a mailing gets to its addressee.
see how addresses differ by country.

up-to-date reference data for 240+ countries
part of doing business worldwide is making sure your customer address database contains properly formatted and accurate international address information. without it, your marketing data, package delivery, and business correspondence will be ineffective. our unique software compares your addresses with a reference database currently covering more than 240 countries and territories and comprehensively updated more than 600 times each year. the most reliable and official suppliers and experts worldwide always keep it current. 
see for yourself with our interactive world map and country list tool.

transliteration and character set mapping
when your addresses are recorded in a foreign writing system, you’ll need them transliterated accurately. address verification supports 40 different character sets and transliterates addresses into latin characters from six different writing systems: latin, greek, cyrillic, japanese, chinese pinyin, and korean. addresses can be automatically transliterated from one system to another. the reference data also contains special characters, as well as locality and street names, in different languages.
