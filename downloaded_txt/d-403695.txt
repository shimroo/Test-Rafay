astrocruise - astrophotography by philip perkins












highlights
 


thank 
          you for visiting..
          astrocruise is about photography - photography of both our 'inner world' 
          (the earth) and our 'outer world' (everything beyond the earth), namely 
          the cosmos; the solar system, the milky way, galaxies, indeed the universe. 
          since the earth is inextricably part of the cosmos there is a strong 
          affinity; photography merges to astrophotography when we aim our cameras 
          above the horizon. it is all photography, and essentially the same light 
          illuminates all of these photographs; it is all a form of 'sunlight' 
          - stars are distant suns.
astrophotography is a special form of photography that (uniquely) reveals 
          objects that are invisible to the unaided eye - the distances within 
          our macrocosm are so vast that much of it can only be seen by means 
          of long exposure photographs. the camera, by accumulating light, helps 
          reveal mysteries of the universe that otherwise remain invisible. the 
          earth and all of its life forms evolved from the same elements that 
          gave light to these photographs - it is all part of our natural heritage.

          the photography on these pages is largely from my home location in wiltshire 
          and from southern france. new images are added frequently so please 
          visit again soon.
please see below for the highlights 
          and news sections which have recent images and the 
          image gallery section which has the complete 
          collection of my work.
