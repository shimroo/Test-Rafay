*tap tap tap* is this thing on?how are you all, my neglected readers?sorry for that, but joey has been busy, doing seminars for the fine people of montana, playing guitar, reading, and snowboarding.in this new twitter, tweeting, twatting, texting 160 characters at a time era, blogs have gone the way of the dodo bird.  that's ok. i am old school, anyway.  i still jerk off manually.

friday night in the boogie station.do me a favor, play this, and scroll down...my wife is in los angeles for 9 weeks getting certified to become a bikram yoga instructor.  that is the kind of yoga where they heat the room to 105 degrees (fahrenheit, for you canadians).i miss wisconsin.that's where i grew up.people from wisconsin have soul.they really do.  we bring it to montana.i live on the crater of the yellowstone supervolcano.  if you give a shit, look it up and read about it.the last time it erupted, the dinosaurs died.i wish they were still around.what is going to evolve next?the day of reckoning will come.it snowed today here, down to 6000 feet, which is fantitstastic.how could you possibly be pissed off or stressed when you live in a place like this?

	 hi there
	 
    


in the middle right of this picture, do you see that spot?   that is a bear.  a big one.   see him there?   that was as close as i wanted to get.   big cinnamon grizz.   it crosses all categories and genres... i hope the kings of leon guys get their shit together and make music like this again:   because that is a big slice of awesome.   i haven't been around much here because i had some knee surgery, and i had some visitors.  there was a little kayaking in there.  a veritable shit ton of guitar playing.  i am also teaching myself the piano, which is fun.   i have a honky-tonk, boogie-woogie kind of natural style, which makes it fun.   also, i am giving serious consideration to growing a full mustache.   nothing says, "i'm a man," like a full tom selleck cock-duster.   there would be tons of leftover soup.   doesn't that look like a heart?   i sure wish i could go to the rock show in the big city.   i'd give a toe, or even my right pinkie, to get you up in the boogie station with me for a jam session, with a drummer and a bass player.   the sky is really, truly big here.   you guys would like it.

i was in maui for a bit, chilling.canada tried to invade montana while i was gone.it's a shame, really.when i got back to town, maple syrup and hockey were taking over the town.  ^^that there is clint eastwood's house.the whole thing bums me out, something fierce.  mankind never fails to disappoint.banyan tree:i just wanna be free to ride my machine without being hassled by the man.the grass is greeen, the rivers are raging, oh and the rapture is nigh.i bolted toward the pacific northwest and olympic national park, faded down into portland.dude ran down the beach with a torch every day at sunset.he would make his way to the top of the cliff, bow to the four directions and throw the torch into the sea.then he dove off.where do i sign up for this job?had a sleeper-cell jam.  matt refused to turn down his bass.  you can see the camera shake.  i told him it would be washed out, but it sounded pretty fucking good in that room.aim low.that way, you'll never be disappointed.
