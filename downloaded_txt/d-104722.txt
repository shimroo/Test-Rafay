thank you! the team will be in touch shortly to confirm 


















storytwo young, idealistic germans, fabricius/fabrizio (fabi) wiest and thomas klausmann, opened suppenküche in 1993. they loved san francisco's spirit but missed beer culture from back home. the goal was to create an unpretentious, simple place where people could come together to share a beer and basic food with friends and strangers alike. they took a chance on hayes valley, which at that time was considered a dangerous, transitional neighborhood. in the spirit of community, they invited all the area merchants to inaugurate their new venture, and suppenküche has been going strong ever since. “we wanted to invite folks in to sit together. it was something new for americans back then. in the old days, you’d sit with your girlfriend at a two-seater table. you were isolated. we were more like let’s all get together. it was fun. everyone was sitting together, old and rich and young, the artists, and the weirdos. that’s how we started.” 










fabi wiest in his 1971 chrysler 300 in hayes valley 





suppenküche literally means soup kitchen in german. fabi says he partly chose the name because he thought all americans love soup (he has since learned they love beer even more), but also because he liked the reference to soup kitchens, which provide food and community to anyone in need. in southern germany, beer is synonymous with community and tradition. german monks began brewing beer for mass consumption over a thousand years ago, and it remains a vital part of german culture to this day. suppenküche carries on this tradition in hayes valley.
