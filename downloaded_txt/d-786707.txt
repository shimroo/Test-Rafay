ipod jukebox: an mp3 dj night
"you know what it's like for a friend to pull a few cds off the shelf and say "hey, check this out?" well, the technology [at ipod jukebox] allowed 13 or so people to do the same favor for a crowd of strangers. pretty cool." -- rob pegoraro, the washington post

next ipod jukebox event: wednesday, april 14, 2010, at cafe saint-ex, washington d.c.

on saturday, august 8, we're hosting a very special edition of ipod jukebox as part of brightest young things' weekly summer camp pool party. bring your ipod and you can spin up to 12 minutes of whatever music you want while relaxing, working on your tan or splashing around in the water. (a total 180 from saint-ex's basement, no?)the party is held at the capitol skyline hotel and runs from noon to 7. the ipod jukebox portion runs until 3:30, or maybe a little later, but you'll want to show up early to reserve a deck chair or couch.read the byt.com event notice for more information. we'll see you there.

as hard as it is for us to believe, june 2009 marks ipod jukebox's five-year anniversary at cafe saint-ex. we'd like to thank everyone at saint-ex who's helped us along the way, from owner mike benson to all the fantastic bartenders (benjy, burleigh, chaim, jonathan, etc.). but most importantly, we'd like to thank everyone who ever brought an ipod, iphone, iriver, zen, zune, blackberry -- we really couldn't have done it without you.please join us for a party at saint-ex on wednesday, june 10, and bring your mp3 players. signup begins around 8:30, and the music begins around 9.(btw, that's the very first ipod jukebox flyer, from may 2004. we've all come a long way since then.)
