you are visitor  to this "website home page/index" since 3-25-01.  thank you!!

(yes, i am aware of the pop-up ads on all of the web pages.  there is a simple explanation for that:  this is a free website.  so....i don't have any control over the ads.  perhaps at some point i will fork out a little something to get rid of the ads, but for now they remain....by the way, 50megs.com hosts my site - and they have been very reliable!!)
