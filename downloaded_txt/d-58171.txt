#31507 ls pan:

the shallowest ls pan on the market at 5 ½"
carries 2 extra quarts over "cast" pan at 7 quarts
contains baffles and trap doors for oil control unlike empty "cast" pans
an oil pan is more than just a "bucket". it needs to work to provide consistent oil supply under all conditions. an empty stock pan can not do that!



#31034 hemi pan:

huge improvement over the empty factory pan and tin baffle with gasket
milodon pan actually contains the oil instead of allowing it to be thrown up into the crank
windage tray pulls oil from the crank and rapidly returns it to the sump
exclusive milodon-designed recovery pocket to further separate the returning oil from the crankshaft.










 after 7 years the milodon charger reappeared at las vegas mopars race last weekend.
the milodon charger was kept an all steel car (except for a fiberglass hood)  with factory glass and power windows - to relate to our customers as a real steel, license plated, street car.
but the car just happens to run 8.40 at 162mph on the track.
our whole family races together, so we know what it takes to put a car together and what our customers need. and going fast is just fun too!
