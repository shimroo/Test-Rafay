faux lunar eclipse





    i found these shots tonight on a memory card.  this was the same night of the lunar eclipse which had ended hours earlier in asia but i got a nice view of it rising above an obscured cloud bank.  crazy moon.

all strobist on your ass





    as the sun was setting on this week's concert and i normally go home and listen to the clock tick because i can't shoot any longer, i used the new canon 430ex dos and held that bastard off camera like those flash bastards at strobist.com and kept shooting away.  the flash is triggered wirelessly on the canon 60d.  what did i learn?  hold it a little higher next time.  but overall new flash says yes!

your lowly and humble photographic servant





jkirlin


everything i call my own, i stole from you.  i can see into your soul with my one good eye.  

'the thing of the moment' refers to the act of taking photos and posting them online; never to the  subjects themselves.  your lowly and humble photographic servant wishes to thank the subjects who appear, knowingly or unknowingly, in this work for their infinite kindness and patience.
