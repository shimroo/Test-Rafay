"now again, just who were the moors? 
the answer is very easy.the original moors,  
like the original egyptians, were black africans. 

as amalgamation became more and more widespread, 
only berbers, arabs and coloureds in the moroccan territories were called moors, 
while the darkest and black-skinned africans were called "black-a-moors". 

eventually, "black" was dropped from "blackamoor". 
in north africa, and morocco in particular, 
all muslim arabs, mixed breeds and berbers are readily regarded as moors. 

the african blacks, having had even this name taken from them, 
must contend for recognition as moors."
