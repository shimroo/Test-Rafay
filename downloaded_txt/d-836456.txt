are you an e-seller that imports items into the u.s. valued at less than $800?  do you import these items duty-free under de minimis (19 u.s.c.  section 1321)?  emtc is collecting stories from e-sellers because the president has restricted the use of de minimis and congress is considering legislation to drastically change or limit an important small business tax exemption that small businesses like yours use.
