scott church american photographer
scott church is a world renowned, internationally published, award winning fine art photographer. 
beginning his career as a us navy photographer serving in operation desert storm aboard the uss tarawa, his career began to flourish. now, his more than twenty-five year career has expanded vastly, including commercial, editorial print and fashion work. scottâs photography can also been seen in marketing and advertising for major corporations.
he has worked as a contributing photographer for hustler magazine (2017), penthouse magazine (2014-2016), and playboy magazine (2010-2011). 
his photographs have been seen and showcased on "vh1's mob wives", the science channel's "odd folks home", along with his popular web series, âscottchurch presents" and 2 feature length documentaries, âthe art of scottchurch" and "scottchurchâs drag". 
he has photographed movie stars and television icons, rap legends and superbowl champions, but he is happiest to work with the regular everyday people that constitute the majority of his clients. he has traveled the world for those clients, photographing people on five of the seven continents and in dozens of countries. most recently (2017) he embarked on a free family portrait road trip (with his wife heather and his son indy) across america photographing families at no charge through 13 states along historic rt 66 from pennsylvania to california.
his images have graced the covers of and been featured in xxl, men's health, latin trends, gothic beauty, leg show, temptress, retro lovely, and fine art photo magazine, along with many others. 
he has published nine books of his photography.
beyond simply producing work, his passion for photography has been spread to others through his numerous private and group photography classes that he has coordinated and taught. scott has placed the seeds of creativity in the minds of students in places like ireland, england; the dominican republic, jamaica, florida, texas, washington, new york, pennsylvania, georgia and many other states and cities around the world. his progeny have gone on to start successful careers of their own and many of their works can be seen in scott churchâs annual âlegacy gallery show." his passion and tireless efforts have created a virtual community within the photography world that has transcended geographic boundaries.
through all of this he has remained grounded and approachable. to this day, if you call the studio he will most likely be the one answering the phone. give it a try.

books
thirty pieces of silver
my first book,  although it was honestly nothing much more than a portfolio pamphlet. this has become one of the most collected and coveted examples of my published work. released in 1999, the limited edition run of 500 sold out in only a few months. since then those few copies have been circulated all over the world. i have seen them sold for 3 or 4 times the original price and it always makes me smile when i find another one on the auction block.
sold out 
trashglamour
my love letter to all of the punk rock girls i have lusted after since i was a child. published as a pocket book in 2003, this was a lark of a project that has gained quite a bit of notoriety. i consider this my introduction to the gothic and fetish community which has since all but taken over my work and my life.
this book has introduced me to so many wonderful people, and opened so many doors for me. i will always see it as a tiny but giant step forward in my art.
sold out 
good luck in hell
i consider this to be my first real book. it is also the first time i chose to publish other artists along with myself. the book includes my work along with the work of 3 other incredibly talented photographers, james groves, l.c., and viva van story. with more than 200 image pages it is quite a substantial collection of fetish, pin up, and erotic art.
i am so very proud and satisfied with this wonderful book. 
sold out 
revelation 
my second big group book, this was a problem child to say the least. setbacks with printing and other production issues threw it into turmoil, but just as with everything, the day it arrived all that went away. today i do nothing but smile when i see it.
yup, it's sold out too.
