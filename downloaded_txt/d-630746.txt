choosing the right builder

posted on  by  

handling a building project can be quite challenging for any homeowner. you want everything from the initial planning to the final design layout to be as you had pictured it. one key aspect of achieving this is by hiring a qualified and reliable builder. one who has the expertise, skills, craftsmanship, and years of experience needed to handle the project seamlessly. 
with that in mind, you need to be very careful when choosing a right contractor for your building project. you certainly want to avoid any cowboy builder that may come your way. one thing for sure, they always have a deal that sounds too sweet to be true. so, what are some of the tips to avoid a fake builder?

tips to avoid cowboy builders
according to house builders https://proficiencybespoke.co.uk/, your building company should evidence creativity, architectural respect, and craftsmanship to show that they can meet and even exceed your expectations. with a cowboy builder, this is something you will hardly see. 
most of them have a tendency of approaching their clients with some of the sweetest deals you could come across. whether it’s the insanely reduced project cost, or perhaps the unrealistic contractual terms they propose, there’s a lot you should be on the lookout for when it comes to cowboy builders. some of the ways you can avoid them include the following:
avoid choosing an inexperienced builder. if you’re looking to have a loft extension, then it would be advisable to hire a contractor who has the experience and specialises in the specific area. for instance, if you want a new build, you cannot hire a contractor who specialises in renovations and extension projects. one way to clarify this is by checking their previously completed projects as well as their portfolio. avoid settling for quotes that are not comprehensive. your builder should be able to provide you with a detailed and comprehensive quote. it is also advisable to make sure that you understand everything that is included in the quote and the highlighted terms. the quote should be inclusive of everything to avoid incurring any additional costs while the project is underway.do not pay upfront before commencing the project. a cowboy builder can give you the best deal in the market and even go ahead and ask you to pay in cash. that is one mistake you should never make. for most professional and qualified builders, you can agree to pay a certain amount upfront to cater for the purchase of some of the building materials but no professional contractor will ever ask you to pay upfront for the whole project.be sure to get quotes from different contractors. this will help you get a more accurate estimate of what you’re likely to spend on your entire project. you should not assume that the cheapest quote is the best. remember, quality also matters a lot, and as most people say, “cheap is expensive!”talking to any previous or current clients. this will not only help you know the relation of your builder with their clients, but you’ll also be able to gauge their expertise and level of experience. you will be able to establish the quality of their work by having a look at their previous client’s reviews. the clients will also give you a first-hand opinion of the builder’s services. 
for every homeowner, the design of the home reflects your style, taste, and preferences. and for you to achieve the right design that pleases and suits you, you’ll need a qualified and reliable builder. this means you cannot compromise when it comes to the specialist you choose to work with. we hope that by going through this article, choosing the right builder will be easier.

how do i minimize the house clearance cost?
first, try to keep all the junk in one place where the clearance team can easily access to reduce any extra labour charges. try to put recyclable waste aside from your general waste since you could be provided with better rates for those recyclable materials. another way to minimize your cost of clearance is by donating; some charities may decide to take particular items that can be considered to be in good condition such as clothes, books, furniture, and much more.
some companies may offer you a cheaper quote so that they can get the job, and they often request a non-refundable deposit (attendance fee). on arrival, they quote a higher price, and you’ll be left in a dilemma whether to choose their high quoted price or to lose the original attendance fee. one last thing to remember is that the law requires you to ensure that all your waste is disposed of properly and when you hire a clearance company, they should have a genuine waste carrier’s registration certificate.

spray foam insulation vs other types of insulation

posted on  by  

replacing the existing insulation in your home or improving the insulation will help you save money on your energy bills. this might be necessary if there is a humidity problem in your home or if you find it difficult to maintain a comfortable temperature. it is important to choose the right material for your insulation.
what are your different options?
you can choose to have spray foam insulation installed, opt for blown insulation or choose batts. blow insulation is either made from fiberglass or cellulose and you can choose between cotton batts or fiberglass batts.
what are the pros and cons of batts?
batts are usually inexpensive but the downside is that they have to be cut. this means there are usually gaps in the insulation. it might be difficult to cover every hole and crawl space in your attic and there will probably be gaps between the different pieces used. this is an inexpensive option and the materials are efficient and durable, but this insulation material will not properly insulate your home.
what are the pros and cons of blown insulation?
this method consists in blowing smaller pieces of cellulose or fiberglass to cover your attic or fill a space between wall panels. this is an efficient way to insulate your home since blown insulation will get in every gap and crawl space.
what are the pros and cons of spray foam insulation?
spray foam insulation is applied directly under the roofline. this is a very efficient insulation material and it is easy to cover every opening. there shouldn’t be any gaps in the insulation if the spray foam is correctly applied. spray foam expands to fill every hole, which makes the application process very easy.
which insulation material is right for you?
you should avoid batts and other similar types of insulation since they are not efficient and will end up costing you more money on your energy bills on the long-term. blown insulation and spray foam insulation are interesting options since they will provide you with the insulation you need to maintain a comfortable temperature in your home.
blown insulation will cover the floor of your attic. this means you won’t be able to use the attic for storage and the space between the attic floor and the roofline will not be insulated, which means humidity might build up. spray foam insulation is a better option since it can be applied directly under the roofline. this means your attic will be insulated and you will be able to use it for storage. if there are hvac ducts that run through your attic, choose spray foam insulation so the ducts are in an insulated space.
you should find out more about insulation specialists in your area like spray foam winnipeg and ask about the materials they offer. spray foam insulation is probably your best option if you want to insulate your entire attic but you might want to consider blown insulation as an alternative if you don’t need insulation directly under your roofline.

office removals london- how to pick a good office removals company in london.

posted on  by  

moving an entire office is not a simple task as it involves moving all the furniture, machines and files to another place. this is why it is mostly a good idea to hire an efficient office removal company to make the office removal process simpler and safer.
when dealing with office removals london, you have to ensure that you choose a highly experienced company. if you are going to move to a smaller office, it is good to choose a company that has a good storage facility that can store any extra belongings.
to move all your supplies safely, the removal company should give you precautionary tools such as padding, boxes, bubble wrap and tape. this will help move your office furniture and supplies in a smooth manner. the office removal team should also be able to dismantle and reassemble furniture.
dismantling and reassembling office furniture is very important as it will help ensure the safety of expensive pieces of furniture. some of the furniture that needs to be dismantled  include large desks and conference tables.
also remember to get insurance quotes from each of the removal companies. since accidents can happen when moving expensive office furniture, it is a good idea to insure your belongings.
even though the insurance policy may end up costing a bit more money, it is a wise move since you will be worry free knowing that you are fully covered for the price of any damaged items.
when choosing a company that will handle your office removals london, you need to make sure that the company is skilled in transporting very heavy equipment. this is because of the fact that office removals involve transportation of heavy cabinets, counters, and desks.
most of the removal services usually offer free quotes. this means that you will have nothing to lose by calling several services and getting as many quotes as possible. the pricing should reflect the quality of services offered.
what you should be looking for is a cost effective office removal company and not a cheap one. you also have to ensure that the quotes do not have any hidden extra fees that may end up costing more than the initial cost.
london based removals companies are usually members of the british association of movers or the guild of movers and removers. choose a company that is a member of the bar as they will assure you that they will abide by the standards and regulations about removals.
choose a company within your locality. if a company has to come to a long distance to collect your stuff and then go to the new place you are moving to, you will have to pay more than the usual price. this is why it is good to pick a company near where your office is located.
the success of an office removal project will depend on moving in and moving out. before you start the relocation process, you need to make a clear plan of your new office. this should include storage areas, furniture layout, and decoration.

is starting a construction company in london a good business idea?

posted on  by  

is starting a construction company in london a good business idea? this is a question some people have been asking themselves lately. with the volatility of the global economy, no job seems safe any more. residents of the united kingdom have to worry about the effects and impacts of brexit on top of this, and the regional economy of london will reflect all of this in more dramatic fashion than most anywhere else. so, some individuals that are handy with tools around their home or even professional construction experience might be thinking now is a good time to become their own boss.
the greater london area certainly represents a prime market for construction. this city of millions continues to grow in population and size, even during economic downturns. it was once the capital of the empire that was said to be so vast and broad that the sun never set on it. london still retains global importance as an international symbol of culture and commerce, and citizens of many nations flock here for education and economic opportunities back home. so, there is always demand for new homes, offices, stores, and other structures. this creates an obvious market and need for qualified construction crews.
in addition to this, the many buildings already standing often need construction projects or renovations done. many of these buildings are in fact older than their occupants, and bringing them up to modern standards and technology is another perpetual market demand for construction workers to come in.
another benefit london has to offer anyone wondering if starting a construction company in london is a good business idea is the fact that on top of great demand for construction services, there is also a talent pool available to hire from. contractors and technicians of all kinds of experience and skill sets comprise a wealth of labour resources that are broad and deep. finding the specialists you need for your projects will not take too many interviews.
there is of course paperwork, rules and regulations, and planning that must go into creating and organizing a small business. fortunately, the united kingdom is a very friendly place to entrepreneurs, and it does not take long to set up the legal and procedural mechanisms that define a small business.
you still have to come up with a business plan though. it is likely going to start with small-scale projects you can do with your existing supplies and tools. you might even be doing your first project by yourself on evenings and weekends while you still work your day job. however, if you finish projects successfully, your business with have a good portfolio of work, satisfied clients spreading the word about you, and a growing reputation. these can all grow to the point that you handle more and more work, hire people to help you, and then start watching the real money roll in. it takes work, dedication, and skills, but starting a construction company in london is a viable financial path for those willing and able.

time frame it is going to take the company to finish the job is a good tip to use as well. by looking at how long it is going to take the company to do the work it will be easier for people to know if the project will be done in time for the work they need to have done or not. without this, people may have some problems in getting the work done because they are on a strict time limit and the construction company people are using are not able to match this deadline.

how a construction company in london can get more leads

posted on  by  

one of the most important aspects of a thriving construction company is a constant flow of new clients. however, with the economy in the state that it is, it can be hard to find clients who are willing to pay premium amounts for new construction.
1) look at the type of projects you are bidding on
many london based construction companies are desperate for clients and are willing to bid for every job that comes across the desk. it may seem that the more bids that are entered the better chance there would be to land a job.
however, that is the wrong approach.
if you are bidding on projects that you cannot afford, you will have to turn around and refuse the project. this is one of the primary ways to ruin your reputation and bring down the company.
instead, it is a better solution to focus on the jobs that are within your reach and capabilities. there are various construction management software that can be used to help manage bids for your company that will streamline the process. in fact, there is bidding software that will allow you to better understand what your specific capabilities are. you know what your businesses strong points are and that is where you need to stay.
2) pick up awards
one of the easiest ways to pick up extra clients is by picking up as many business awards as possible, and it doesn’t have to be that hard to win them.
don’t feel as though you have to win the big awards as soon as possible. there are many other small awards that can be picked up with just good service to the community. when your company achieves these accolades, have a press release issued and post it on your website. these is free publicity that will help draw attention to your construction company.
once your company is able to qualify for the large awards like the master design awards, you can expect a large number of clients. as people see the accolades that your business has been awarded, it will bring in many new clients.
3) advertise your business
one of the most important aspects of bringing clients into the business is the ability to show your brand off to as many people as possible. for example, if your company is working in the neighbourhood you may want to place a sign outside of the site to let people know who is doing the work.
another way to promote yourself is to ask clients if they can be used as a referral. it is a wise idea to make sure you are listed on review sites like yelp. clients want to see a company that they can trust and want to see one that has done quality work. in short, they are looking to work with a brand that they can trust.
4) be accessible
are clients able to reach you easily or do they have to chase you down? clients should have a wide range of choices to get in contact with you or your construction company in london directly. this includes being able to call, instant message, or email. in addition, this is the digital age, your company should have a twitter and facebook account where you can be contacted as well. it is vital that a client is able to get in touch with you and get a response back as soon as possible. if you do not have their preferred style of communication available, they may find someone else who does.
when you have multiple lines of communication open, it helps to cast a much wider net for leads.
remember, it never hurts to hand out your personal phone number if you are looking to bring in larger clients. being able to respond to bigger clients personally and quicker is an optimal way to bring in new leads.
5) don’t forget the human touch
we live in a world, where business has become quite distant. this is one way you can differentiate your business from the competition. take the time to get to know your clients. know them by first name, know about their families and their hobbies. people always love to talk about themselves and their families. knowing these little bits of information will help to fire up small talk and they will appreciate you interest in them.
once the job has been completed, always get back in touch. go the extra mile and send a personal note that shows them that you enjoyed their business and hope that you can use them as a referral.
use these tips to help increase your business in these turbulent construction times. always be on the lookout for new clients. however, never neglect or forget about the clients you have right now. keep in touch with them and you never know when you might get a referral.
