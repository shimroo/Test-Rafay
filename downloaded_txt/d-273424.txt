welcome to andy mohr automotive! we’ve been proudly serving the driving public since 1992. throughout all that time, our car dealership in indiana has been your one-stop shop for all things automotive. as a result, we provide our customers with an impressive inventory of new, used, and certified pre-owned models and expert finance and service centers.
our neighbors in plainfield, bloomington, and indianapolis, in, can learn more about us by taking a moment to check out the information we’ve provided for them below. if our friends in avon and fishers, in, have any questions along the way, please let us know! we want to get you out on the road in your new ride, so you can travel along i-69 or on the roads of glendale from behind the wheel of your ideal mode of transportation.
our wide selection of new and used cars
12 dealerships make us what we are today, and we pride ourselves on our diverse collection of used, new, and certified cars on our various lots. as one of the many car dealers in indianapolis, what sets us apart is our vast selection. we understand and appreciate that everyone is looking for something different in their next ride, whether it be for daily commutes, carpooling the kids to school, or weekend road trips.
as one of the area’s top used car dealers of indianapolis, we offer an array of used sedans, suvs, and trucks on our lot. see below for some examples of what you can expect to find here:

toyota tacoma: load up this tough truck with all your fishing gear and head to lake lemon in bloomington.
nissan pathfinder: pack in your crew, along with some bikes in this capable suv and check out sodalis nature park in plainfield.
honda accord: use this zippy sedan to go to the indianapolis zoo with your little ones, so they can see lions, tigers, and bears…oh my!

this is just a sampling of the models you can find at our car dealerships in indiana.
we also have a plethora of new and certified pre-owned (cpo) models for you to choose from. these can supply you with an abundance of benefits due to the fact that cpo vehicles are newer than most used cars and have a limited number of miles. on top of that, they have to pass a strict inspection process to earn their certification and come with reassuring warranties.


 
financing your used car
we work hard to be one of the top car dealers in indianapolis, which is why we have an on-site finance center that’s comprised of expert financers dedicated to creating payment plans tailored to each individual driver. you’ll be paired with a skilled team member who’ll work with you one on one to determine the best financial route for your lifestyle, whether it’s buying or leasing, and address any questions you have.
additionally, we want you to know that we have put helpful resources at your disposal to make it possible to get a head start prior to walking through our doors. first, there’s the payment calculator. this aide can help you narrow down your prospects by finding out which one offers the monthly payments that fit best with your budget.
are you thinking about trading in your current on-road companion? that’s where the value your trade tool comes in. it allows you to quickly get an accurate estimate of how much your ride is worth, so you know how much you’ll be able to use toward the down payment on your next one. finally, there’s the finance application. filling out this secure form sees to it that the ball gets rolling in terms of being approved for a loan, if that’s your goal.
quality service team
it’s no secret that preventive maintenance for your new or used car is key to its longevity and performance. so, to help ensure its health for years to come, we have a skilled service center team at your disposal. for routine matters like oil changes, brake repair, tire rotations, and more, you can count on us to have your back. we’re also here if the unexpected happens and can handle major repairs as well as issues related to collisions.
the technicians who you can count on to get the work done according to a high set of standards are certified, experienced, and highly trained. not only do they know which methods deliver the best possible results for any given situation, but they have access to the latest industry technology and equipment for an increase in precision, no matter what the job might be.
you can be confident that any needed parts replacements are done using original equipment manufacturer (oem) parts. because these are the components that are designed to be used in your model, they give you a high level of quality. are there certain procedures you prefer to take care of on your own? we can help you with that as well by seeing to it you have the best possible parts at your disposal. you’re welcome to order the items you need by filling out our online form.
the main priority of our certified techs is to get you back out on the roads of indiana—wherever you have your sights set. maybe you’d like to visit opa! in avon for some authentic greek cuisine or bubba’s 33 in fishers for a burger and fries.
schedule an appointment online today or contact us with any questions. be sure to consult our service and parts specials page for any of our current specials that match what maintenance you would like to have performed. each special includes a detailed description, the offer’s expiration date, and a button to print the coupon, so you can present it and have it redeemed when you’re here.
