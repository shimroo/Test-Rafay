							this was an amazing tour in two parts: first rwanda, then kenya/tanzania. in all cases, the driver/guides were excellent, well informed and safe drivers. the serena and sopa hotels were all terrific and we would stay in those again… this was a trip of a lifetime and we were very pleased with all the preparations.
