        most of the sculptures are carved from highly sought after western red cedar, salvaged in the central cascade mountains.  each 
      carving holds its own special characteristic quality. 


        chainsaw 

        jack mixes different paints to best recreate the colors of 
        nature. he also puts a relief line in most of the carvings to allow the 
        wood to expand and contract with the weather. 


        the red cedar we use is exceptionally resistant to both moisture and insects, additionally a quality clear wood preservative is used to seal 
        and enhance the natural rich 

      color that cedar has to offer.


      remember to check back often, for we add new carvings all the time!
