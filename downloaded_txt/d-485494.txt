welcome to sacred insights!hello beautiful soul,my name is kathy.  i am a teacher, an empath, a soul whisperer, an author, a healer, and more.  i have been providing these services and sharing my gifts with the world for nearly 20 years now, and loving every minute of it.  i have always found a deep sense of satisfaction in helping others feel empowered to share their gifts with the world.  now i feel called (and blessed) to help souls feel empowered, strong, and supported through their spiritual journey.  my job is to assist you and guide you to heal yourself first, only then you can truly share your gifts with the world.  in the words of gandhi, “you must be the change you wish to see in the world.”  that means that if we want to see a world lead and supported by strong, empowered, spiritual women then we must become strong, empowered, spiritual women!  my friends, it is time for the divine feminine energy to rise up.  our world is in need of infinite compassion, infinite love, infinite acceptance, and infinite wisdom.  our world is in need of strong, empowered, spiritual women who can step out of the shadows and into the light.  our world is in need of whatever gifts you have to offer, and it needs them right now.it does not really matter where you are starting out, you may just be beginning your journey or you may have been on the path for decades.  i will gladly meet you where you are and guide you to where you want to go.  i will support you with love, compassion, and intuitive wisdom.
