how it all began…

 

after world ii ended, the 95th airbase at horham, england was closed and returned to farmland, and the veterans returned to the states. years later, they began to re-connect with each other at the mighty eighth air force reunions.  it was at one of these reunions in 1977 that a group of 95th veterans decided to have reunions of their own, for the sole purpose of reuniting those who served in the 95th bomb group.

  









  

this idea led them to create the 95th bomb group (h) association, which consisted only of veterans who had served in the 95th bomb group.   starting in 1981, the association met regularly and created several memorials to honor 95th veterans who were lost in the war.the veterans realized that in order for their legacy to continue, the next generation needed to become involved.  in 1995, the 95th bomb group memorials foundation, inc. was formed, a 501(c)(3) non-profit arizona corporation.  in 2004, the 95th bomb group association disbanded and veterans and legacy members consolidated under the umbrella of the 95th bomb group memorials foundation, inc. board of directors and committeesarticles of incorporationby-laws
