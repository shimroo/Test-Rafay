what our clients are saying...















arthur murray quote



              we don't stop dancing because we grow too old; we grow old when we
              choose to stop dancing.

          danbury arthur murray provides excellent dance instruction. my wife
          and i have taken private lessons elsewhere but found arthur murray
          instruction to be the most beneficial. from patient, one-on-one
          instruction, to group lessons, and themed parties ‚Äî they do their best
          to ensure everyone has a great time.

          called on a whim to inquire about dance lessons for our upcoming
          wedding... three months later, we are taking weekly lessons with some
          of the nicest, most enthusiastic dance instructors! everyone is so
          welcoming and makes you feel comfortable even if dancing is not your
          thing - highly recommended for anyone looking to learn something new,
          increase confidence on the dance floor, or connect with their partner!
          thank you arthur murray danbury!

          been eyeing dance lessons in danbury for a while and finally decided
          to go and see what it would be like. the private one on one lessons is
          where they teach you at your pace and personalized they teach a lot of
          different genres and i love the group classes where you get to
          practice with other students. great atmosphere and energy love coming
          here every week!
