phil patton 











 welcome to the website of author, writer, museum curator, and educator phil patton (1952-2015), whose work was particularly influential in the design community. his papers are now housed at the milton glaser design study center and archives of the school for visual arts in new york, where he enthusiastically taught in the dcrit program (now the design research, writing and criticism program).in this reincarnation of his original website, his family hopes to supplement the sva’s scholarly collection, and to share his insights in other fields – art; architecture; american history, culture, and highways; technology; and military hardware and secrecy (no doubt influenced by his father’s wwii experience). we also hope to capture a bit of his humor and generosity through his stories and artifacts.this is an ongoing project that will be continuously updated.newest addition: articles by phil patton
