we are a ministry of the baptist state convention of north carolina and have welcomed guests from across the state and beyond since opening in 1949.

about us












testimonies — written and strengthened here







when summer comes around, i miss caswell a lot. my experience at that place had a huge impact on me spiritually. no doubt, some of the best memories of my life.
justin elliott







it seems that when i pass through the gates of caswell my spirit breathes for the first time all year. our ministry saw 18 of our students baptized along with two strangers walking along the beach all because one student chose to be obedient. god’s blessings do not come any better.
chris ledford







ten years ago, i went to caswell as a chaperone for my church youth group. i went with a personal problem, begging god to hear my prayer. he heard and answered!
