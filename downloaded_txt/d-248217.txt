(imagining changes is what we call "worrying".) if you fear that you will not have enough money to pay your rent, that is stress. if you worry that you may get fired, that is stress. if you think that you may receive a promotion at work, that is also stress (even though this would be a good change). whether the event is good or bad, imagining changes in your life is stressful.anything that causes change in your daily routine is stressful.anything that causes change in your body health is stressful.imagined changes are just as stressful as real changes.let us look at several types of stress -- ones that are so commonplace that you might not even realize that they are stressful.......emotional stresswhen arguments, disagreements, and conflicts cause changes in your personal life -- that is stress.illnesscatching a cold, breaking an arm, a skin infection, a sore back, are all changes in your body condition.pushing your body too harda major source of stress is overdriving yourself. if you are working (or partying) 16 hours a day, you will have reducedyour available time for rest. sooner or later, the energy drain on your system will cause the body to fall behind in its repair work. there will not be enough time or energy for the body to fix broken cells, or replace used up brain neurotransmitters. changes will occur in your body's internal environment. you will "hit thewall," "run out of gas". if you continue, permanent damage may be done. the body's fight to stay healthy in the face of the increased energy that your are expending is major stress.environmental factorsvery hot or very cold climates can be stressful. very high altitude may be a stress. toxins or poisons are a stress. each of these factors threatens to cause changes in your body's internal environment.the special case of tobacco usetobacco is a powerful toxin!! smoking destroys cells that clean your trachea, bronchi, and lungs. smoking causes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which progress to slow suffocation. the carbon monoxide from cigarette smoking causes chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. tobacco use damages the arteries in your body, causing insufficient blood supply to the brain, heart, and vital organs. cigarette smoking increases the risk of cancer 50 fold.chewing tobacco or snuff is no safe haven. it also damages your arteries, and it carries the same cancer risk. (cancers of the head and neck are particularly vicious, disfiguring, and deadly).poisoning the body with carbon monoxide, and causing the physical illnesses of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer, and arterial damage, tobacco is a powerful source of added stress to one's life.hormonal factorspubertythe vast hormonal changes of puberty are severe stressors. a person's body actually changes shape, sexual organs begin to function, new hormones are released in large quantities. puberty, as we all know, is very stressful.pre-menstrual syndromeonce a woman passes puberty, her body is designed to function best in the presence of female hormones. for women past puberty, a lack of female hormones is a major stress on the body. once a month, just prior to menstruation, a woman's hormone levels drop sharply. in many women, the stress of sharply falling hormones is enough to create a temporary overstress. this temporary overstress is popularly known as pre menstrualsyndrome (pms).post-partumfollowing a pregnancy, hormone levels change dramatically. after a normal childbirth, or a miscarriage, some women may be thrown into overstress by loss of the hormones of pregnancy.menopausethere is another time in a woman's life when hormone levels decline. this is the menopause. the decline in hormones during menopause is slow and steady. nevertheless, this menopausal decline causes enough stress on the body to produce overstress in many women.taking responsibility for another person's actionswhen you take responsibility for another person's actions, changes occur in your life over which you have little or no control. taking responsibility for another person's actions is a major stressor.allergic stressallergic reactions are a part of your body's natural defense mechanism. when confronted with a substance which your body considers toxic, your body will try to get rid of it, attack it, or somehow neutralize it. if it is something that lands in your nose, you might get a runny, sneezy nose. if it lands on your skin, you might get blistery skin. if you inhale it, you'll get wheezy lungs. if you eat it, you may break out in itchy red hives all over your body. allergy is a definite stress, requiring large changes in energy expenditure on the part of your body's defense system to fight off what the body perceives as a dangerous attack by an outside toxin.â the medical basis of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and drug useexplained in fun, easy to read, formatstop and take theinteractive stress testin the interactive stress test we have asked you to look at the last twelve months of changes in your life. this may surprise you. it is crucial to understand, however, that a major change in your life has effects that carry over for long periods of time. it is like dropping a rock into a pond. after the initial splash, you will experience ripples of stress. and these ripples may continue in your life for at least a year.so, if you have experienced total stress within the last twelve months of 250 or greater, even with normal stress tolerance, you may be overstressed. persons with low stress tolerance may be overstressed at levels as low as 150.overstress will make you sick. carrying too heavy a stress load is like running your car engine past the red line; or leaving your toaster stuck in the "on" position; or running a nuclear reactor past maximum permissible power. sooner or later, something will break, burnup, or melt down.what breaks depends on where the weak links are in your physical body. and this is largely an inherited characteristic.â here are the common "weak links", and the symptoms of their malfunctionâ brain overstressfatigue, aches and pains, crying spells, depression, anxiety attacks, sleep disturbance.gastrointestinal tractulcer, cramps and diarrhea, colitis, irritable bowel.glandular systemthyroid gland malfunction.cardiovascularhigh blood pressure, heart attack, abnormal heart beat, stroke.skinitchy skin rashes.immune systemdecreased resistance to infections and neoplasm.we have known for a long time that overstress could cause physical damage to the gastrointestinal tract, glandular system, skin or cardiovascular system. but only recently have we learned that overstress actually causes physical changes in the brain. one of the most exciting medical advances of our decade has been an understanding of how overstress physically affects your brain. we now know that the fatigue, aches and pains, crying spells, depression, anxiety attacks and sleep disturbances of overstress are caused by brain chemical malfunction.here's how it works..........  next pagesorry,  we can't give medical advice.first edition copyright â© 1989 second edition copyright â© 1990 steve burns/kimberley burns. all rights reserved, including the right to reproduce this information or portions thereof in any form. 1997-2019 revised for electronic distribution. the holmes and rahe stress scale is used here by permission of pergamon press.disclaimer: our mission is health education, particularly at a high school and college level. this is not medical advice. for help with a personal health concern, please consult your qualified health care provider.
