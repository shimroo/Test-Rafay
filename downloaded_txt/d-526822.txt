unity with community 



getting parishes involved 










“in the end my heart will triumph”is the the heavenly promise given to us by our lady of fatima in 1917. consecration to the triumphant victory of the immaculate heart of mary is the plan and call to each one of us for the renewal of the church (and so of the world) is the triumph. the unity with community starts with each parish and parishioner giving our lady our yes given through our consecration to the immaculate heart of mary. to become an apostle for her triumph. a yes which is ready to accept the joys as well as the sorrows. we must speak with her words, she must be allowed to speak through us. her only request is to become her child, to give witness on every occasion, every time and everywhere, and to have the courage to have no agenda. mary will do everything. the unity we will experience in our hearts among us, will be the most powerful sign of the triumph of the immaculate heart of mary. what is most important that we are one. when we are one heart can the holy spirit descend upon us. he can only come if he finds among us the same life, the same essence which is his life–unity!
