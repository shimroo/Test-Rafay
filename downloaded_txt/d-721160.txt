relaxing? you have a choice: take a nap… boring. or, you could kick back with a cold one next to a cascading waterfall with friends, listen to a bubbling rock column fountain or watch the koi move under all those gorgeous water pond lilies. no brainer.
we are the tri-state authority for stress-free living.
why is that? we live and breathe building custom designed water features that can soothe and calm even the savage beast. we do it right the first time so you don’t have to do it over… and we guarantee our workmanship.
we take pride in the fact that we can turn a dreary backyard into a custom waterscape showplace in just one or two days. we love to makeover an existing water feature that has design issues, correct it, maintain it and let the homeowner get back to enjoying their backyard paradise.
browse our new website for more information, visit our belvidere retail center or order supplies online. now’s the time to get a design consultation scheduled and don’t forget to sign up for our “frogger” newsletter!
