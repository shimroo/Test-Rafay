i loved sociology. being in the bar business, you’re dealing with people — having good people skills, developing relationships with people. to me, that’s the most important thing.

i entered quinsigamond as a freshman at the age of 29. i wasn't sure exactly what my major was going to be, but after my first biology class i got to see my first microorganism under a microscope and i was hooked. qcc faculty have been nothing but supportive. it's honestly been wonderful to be a part of.

april's story












we enter qcc with a goal, a dream, and along the way we acquire skills needed to be successful in the workforce, and in life. we are taught confidence, communication, teamwork, humanity and awareness of our community.

supporting our community and the people in it



qcc alumna tiana diaz knows firsthand what it’s like to be down on your luck and feel like there is nowhere to turn for help, but today the mother of three is running her own successful business, t.a.j. tropicals & trinkets, named after her children. the powerhouse entrepreneur took a roundabout way to entrepreneurship, and credits qcc with saving her life and giving her the confidence to be the person she knew she could always be.

from language learner to business owner



"i took english at the university level at quinsigamond. if you put your mind to it, you learn a lot. i got my construction supervisor's license during that time. i think that if you have any kind of business, and you want that business to thrive, you must learn some english. and a very good place for someone to learn english is qcc."
