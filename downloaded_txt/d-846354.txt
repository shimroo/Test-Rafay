welcome to our online repository of alchemical texts!
alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that has its roots in the ancient world and is part of western esotericism. it involves the study of the transformation of matter and the search for the philosopher’s stone, a legendary substance believed to have the power to transmute base metals into gold and grant immortality. wisdom works alchemy.
alchemy emerged in hellenistic egypt and was further developed during the islamic golden age, where it was practiced alongside medicine and chemistry. in the middle ages, it spread to europe and became associated with mysticism and spirituality, particularly within christian and jewish traditions. it was during this period that the idea of the transmutation of metals began to be seen as a metaphor for spiritual transformation.
