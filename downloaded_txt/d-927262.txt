dancers designing for dancers!
only a dancer can understand a dancer's unique needs.   when that dancer was also one of canada's 
			best-established professional designers, you were the winner!
			
farida & len wong were award-winning competitive dancers and professional 
			instructors.   for over 50 years, they'd been helping other dancers to shine with their exquisite 
			collection of original ballroom and latin dance costumes.   designed and created only in canada!
			
farida wong dancewear offered an extensive line of beautiful practice and social dancewear, including
			american and international style ballroom dance dresses, latin costumes, and luxurious evening wear.   
			the collection also offered a variety of skirts, bodysuits, blouses, and tops.   
			all provided great comfort and fit!   and we had specially selected accent pieces and 
			jewelry to complement your dancewear.
