love, hate, accommodate





    i.    through life have we slept?  so easily kept.    it’s "hang in, don’t quit,"  when feeling like shit.ii.in being we must,invisible trust;in god, disagree--the lost family.iii.the primary nurture,the well-plotted future,splits open the suture/appeases the moocher.iv.  the complex, the kin, the chance of "the win,”   the warring, within with authority/sin.v.so subject to flatter,for why not i matter?!so easily thrown--at last on the throne!vi.seduced by the mask,the spotlight, the bask;so urgent, the task--the answer, the ask.vii.where instinct is lack,the knife turns the back,the beauty of others,asleep, under covers.viii.indulging the dread,the ‘we’ in my head.the notion of “right,”the fight and/or flight.ix.if strong is this strong,do i still belong?the more that i calm,the echo, alarm.x.    the more that i freak, the same old antique;the more that i seek--the current, the creek.xi.the more that i settle,the lesser the mettle;the more that i sit,the cosmotic wit.     xii.the freedom of “go,”the persistent "no,"the more that i know:a fox in the snow.xiii.the stillness, the norm,the limited form?   the journey, alone: the dog and its bone.     xiv.   the shaking of hands, the whether it lands,   perhaps we’re all shamans with too much in common.xv.despite what we know,and cover, and show;despite what we want--the solace, the font.xvi.   despite what we’ve missed,the unchecked, the list;still, somehow, exists--a rock in the mist.

the meadow





as bambi's motherled her fawnonto the meadowand was gone,so i was shown,and, thus, exposedto pastures whereforeboding bodes.without the treesthat hide the sun,the vast expansebelied the gun.for when the shotshattered the calm,the earth became a maelstrom.the moment's shock,the past forgot,i ran to wherei had been not.in foreign forests,overgrown,i realizedi was alone.and in the absenceof my mother,the canopy,my only cover,the meadow, then,proposed a testof fortitude and mindfulness.while i still grazebeyond the grove,the hand recallsthe burning stove.

the shame





 for emily dickinson        when next you feel the shame        because you lost the game;        an insult to your name,        rejected from the same--        recall that you are you        and others, themselves, too;        so best not misconstrue        conclusions others drew.        or those that they will draw        for @*$#!--the fatal flaw        of interest in the jaw,        incredulous of awe--        is when the money comes,        and you still feel like crumbs,        and catch the dreaded numbs        and over-favor thumbs.        for fervor favors few;        and when the justice's due        is when the judgment comes--        "do you have change for ones?"

la





               i used to live in la.  and i went there for a visit over the weekend.  and a flood of memories returned.                 i remember the first time i saw palm trees.  and ate a real burrito.  and saw the ocean.  and the mountains and smog.                and the new age flyers.  and the muscle beach boys.  and the cabanas; the year-round outdoors.  and the cults and psychics.  the coyotes and brushes.                 it's nice to know it's all still there.
