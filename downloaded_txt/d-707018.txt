customer feedback







i was so pleased with my first attempt at using liquid light. thanks for making the instructions so clear and the process so simple!
- joel harris





really fun, straightforward kit. i ordered one, have never tried doing any kind of wet or dry plate photography, and ended up getting a really great image out of a 130 year old rochester premo b which is unbelievable.
-  serrini





i can't tell you how much i love the beauty of the liquid light emulsion. it is the finest chloro-bromide emulsion available anywhere, better than any paper i've used since agfa portrigga.
- accra





i am a returning customer and have used halo-chrome for a number of years now. great product!
- max kellenberger





the most desirable characteristics of the photos made from this kit are it's blue only light sensitivity and the irregularities in the image created due to the emulsion being hand applied.
- sean mccormick




great product. after some trial & error on metering for proper exposure, i am now consistently producing images that i am very happy with. i would recommend this product.
