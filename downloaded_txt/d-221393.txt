affordable, accessible vaccines & antibodieswe are a nonprofit scientific research organization that develops vaccines and antibodies for hiv, tuberculosis, and emerging infectious diseases.about us 




our approach

we take a full-circle approach to product development, from the grassroots level to the lab to legislative bodies.


mission

to translate scientific discoveries into affordable, globally accessible public health solutions.


vision

a world where all people have equitable access to innovative vaccines and therapeutics.





our health areashivtuberculosislassa fevermarburg virussudan ebolavirushivthe challengehiv/aids remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases, with 1.3 million people acquiring hiv in 2023. given the complexities of hiv, traditional approaches to vaccine development have so far failed to result in a vaccine that provides protection against hiv. however, a vaccine is still needed to bring a true end to the hiv pandemic. source: unaids our solutioniavi scientists and our collaborators are developing next-generation hiv vaccines to address the challenges of hiv vaccine design. together, we have pioneered promising new vaccination strategies and the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) against hiv. iavi and our partners are developing hiv bnabs to prevent hiv acquisition while we advance vaccine candidates.tuberculosisthe challengetuberculosis (tb) is the world’s leading infectious disease killer. in 2023, 10.8 million people fell ill with tb and 1.25 million people died of tb disease. the only available tb vaccine is the century-old bacille calmette-guérin, or bcg. while this vaccine has efficacy in protecting against severe tb disease in infants and young children, it is largely ineffective in adolescents and adults, among whom most transmission and disease occurs. source: whoour solutioniavi works across our global hubs with a diverse network of partners to advance the most promising tb vaccine candidates from discovery through clinical trials, and eventually, to post-licensure access. our work extends to policy and advocacy initiatives that support tb vaccine development and access in regions where new vaccines are needed most.lassa feverthe challengelassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness endemic to west africa that causes significant annual outbreaks of disease. lassa fever is difficult to diagnose, and surveillance data is limited. current estimates range from 300,000 to 500,000 cases and 5,000 related deaths each year. no licensed vaccines for lassa fever exist. source: whoour solutioniavi is developing a single-dose vaccine candidate for lassa that is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv) vector. this technology is similar to that underlying an approved ebola zaire virus vaccine. iavi’s lassa vaccine candidate was well tolerated and immunogenic over a wide dose range in a phase i clinical study. iavi also conducts lassa epidemiological studies and modeling to support future vaccine access.marburg virusthe challengemarburg virus is a filovirus and the causative agent of marburg virus disease (mvd), which has a case fatality ratio of up to 88%. marburg virus has the capacity to cause outbreaks with high fatality rates and is a potential bioterror threat. no vaccines or antiviral treatments are approved for mvd. a marburg vaccine is urgently needed to respond to future outbreaks. source: who our solutioniavi is developing a vaccine candidate for marburg that is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv) vector. this technology is similar to that underlying an approved ebola zaire virus vaccine, which is now approved by the u.s. fda and registered for use in several african countries. preclinical data demonstrates that iavi’s marburg vaccine candidate is highly protective in an animal model with one dose.sudan ebolavirusthe challengesudan ebolavirus is a filovirus and causes outbreaks of ebola disease, most recently in 2022 in uganda. case fatality rates of ebola disease caused by sudan ebolavirus have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks. the licensed vaccine for ebola zaire virus does not provide cross protection against the sudan strain. an ebola sudan vaccine is urgently needed to prevent and respond to future outbreaks. source: whoour solutioniavi is developing a vaccine candidate for sudan ebolavirus that is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv) vector similar to the technology underlying an approved ebola zaire virus vaccine. during the 2022 ebola outbreak in uganda, the who selected iavi’s sudan ebolavirus vaccine candidate for a planned ring vaccination trial. while the trial did not go forward due to outbreak control, iavi has continued clinical development to prepare for future outbreaks.  
our impactwe conduct preclinical and clinical trials of our own vaccines and antibodies. our focus is on diseases of global importance for which there is no market and little financial incentive for development. we also collaborate with and support other scientific organizations to conduct their own clinical trials of priority disease prevention and therapeutic interventions.255 partners from academic, biotech, pharma sectors, civil society, and global health initiatives53 biologics candidates supported by the iavi product development center, out of which 25 advanced to clinical trials   70,000 volunteers enrolled in observational epidemiology studies

tb vaccines: achievable not aspirational


					december 05, 2024				

						the tuberculosis (tb) vaccine field has experienced a renaissance in recent decades. until the 1990s, no novel tb vaccine candidates had been developed since the introduction of the bacillus calmette-guérin vaccine in 1921. since then, the field has advanced slowly but surely against what is once again the world’s deadliest infectious disease. these advances helped […]
