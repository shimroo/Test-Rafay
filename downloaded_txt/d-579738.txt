welcome
to the new wave in korean martial arts.
just
as the sun rising over the horizon denotes the coming of a new day.
so it is with the martial arts of "the land of morning calm".
inevitably, as the new rays of light pierce through and take over the
darkness that once preceded in the night, so the "rays of
modern-progressive-knowledge" will enlighten those with an open
mind, and a hungry heart. such is the martial art of:
de
alba system - modern farang mu sul®
the
dawn of a new era has arrived. finally, true balanced and
comprehensive training is available. not merely in words, but in
actions. 
welcome
to the official site formodern farang mu sul®
international
using
over 40 years of martial arts experience, this art was developed by
grand master michael de alba. although his focus has been in korean
systems, this art reflects numerous influences from a wide variety of
styles in grand master de alba's background. this system was
developed to achieve two main purposes:

it
has evolved into what we believe to be one of the most comprehensive,
progressive, and effective martial arts that exists today.
we
are
not implying that this system it is the end all, be all –
it
will always be the individual that makes the art, not the other way
around.
this
philosophy is placed into action by both taking an honest evaluation
of the martial arts, in regards to what is functional in and
pertinent to today’s world and by honestly, freely expressing
ourselves in the sense of being a true warrior and all that this
entails. this philosophy can and must co-exist within the framework
of gritty "traditional principles" and modern training as
well as progressive thinking. without loosing sight of where we came
from, we owe it to ourselves as well as our predecessors to move
forward to the next level.
