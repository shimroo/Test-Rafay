	monitor adjustment: you should be able to see 17 different shades in above.  
	if you do not see differences at both ends of the wedge you are definitely 
	missing out.  you can  adjust your monitor and/or room lighting 
	until you do.  newer images on this website are best viewed at high 
	resolutions on a large, well-calibrated display device.  i switched to 
	an "hd"
	1920 by 1200 
	pixel hp lp2475w monitor with an ips panel providing a very wide gamut 
	in 12/2008.  after that one got dinged up, i upgraded to a dell 
	ultrasharp u3011 30" monitor in 2011!  that one is still going 
	strong in 2017.
