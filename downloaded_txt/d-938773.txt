2016 election so if trump wins, the best way to see about half of my friends again is to get one of the terrific new jobs at the pence-a-torium conversion centers where said friends will be detained and re-educated back to normal. it'll be huge, they'll have the best treatment. true growth industry.

new word buk-coke-ke. bucokeke. spelling needs work, but it's the situation where the drive through attendant hands you your soda pop and it's dripping with beverage so it ends up all over your hand, your pants, the cupholder, etc.

car stuff hit 111,111 miles. did an oil change and transmission flush about 2 weeks ago (30k fluid). new battery today (car died, would not start). did not start it up over the weekend, and it's been in the negatives lately, so it's my own fault it didn't start this morning.

hi i've had this thing for a while, and i've...aged. matured? grown older? travelled along this mortal coil once step closer to the great majority? i miss the closeness and camaraderie that this once held, what with transitions away from this medium and those who have fallen to the wayside.  i will use this more frequently.

 it's just cray cray about the things that change over the years. like, i hung out with someone last weekend who's now a lawyer. when i met her, she was still in high school, the littlest sister. now? law-talking dude. the girl what had her baby senior year in high school? he can vote. man, time keeps on tickin' tickin' tickin' into the fuuuuchuuuuuuuurrrr. so. acen. slept through the panels i wanted to see, hung out with the people i wanted to hang with (except one, and i felt awkward about trying to message/call, since we're just intarweb friends), and it was good stuffs. but things are cool, too. babies. babies everywhere. people getting married left and right. also? roughly 597345097 lilies sprouting in the front yard from last year's bulbs. i have a bag of canna lillies that i need to pot and plant.

i need help i need a couple people to come over to the house for some grooming assistance. namely, i need some burly people to help wrap the gf up in a blanket like a cat burrito so i can cut her toeclaws. please bring thick work clothing and heavy gloves (scratching, biting) and some ear protection (yowling). we may need to move the bed if she hides underneath it, too.

 i think it comes down to a different meaning of what we mean by 'clean'. the gf's version appears to be "hide all the mess and clutter in drawers and closets and under beds and give everything a good wipedown."mine appears to be "bleachbomb the germfortress and reign hellfire upon the microbes!" which ends up with one really clean area and more clutter elsewhere because i moved the clutter to nuke it from orbit.

(comment on this)monday, september 30th, 201310:47 am
dreamthings okay, first off, what the hell, brain??so, here's the chronology, as best i can remember: got voluntold that i'm in a play written by coop (almalgamashup of gf's dad's bff and gf's band teach, i don't even know. cooperton?) looking for a room for the thing, got off on the wrong floor (well, not really, since this place was numbered like ass), and wandered around. most buildings have the 100s on the first floor, with 200s on the second, right? expanded to 1000s on first floor and 2000s on second floor for bigger places. this place? not so much. 100s on the right, and 363 was on the left, up a flight of stairs, then down two flights of stairs (like, up and over a hallway or something, wtf architect?), and then bam. and by bam, i mean, i'm in a stairwell overlooking the stage of the auditorium, so when they started asking where i was, i dropped in. literally. from one storey up. like the badass i am, becuase in dreams i'm a badass. like you do. no, didn't do the ironman 3-point landing on my knee thing, but the full proper standing-to-crouched-frog landing. the rehearsal starts, and i left my script in my bag or whatever, thinking that this was more of a meeting than a rehearsal or something (that's what i'm thinking now, at the time it made more sense), and then i realize that everyone's off book. and? all signing asl while acting. uh. what?!no, for real, this was a thing in my head. i blame bocca musica for this. went to the renfest yesterday, and bocca stalled for time describing american sign language stuff, as last weekend was deaf weekend (this was last day of last weekend, so no fucks given for these instructions) and they, on stage, were describing & instructing how to say things like 'penis', 'vagina', 'fart', 'queef', 'bitch, please', 'sex,', 'orgy', 'bukakke', etc. and how the gesture for 'shy' is very similar to 'whore' (one's making a fishy fin flap at the base of your jaw, the other is to stroke your jaw from throat to chin) so when the new-to-asl student was asked why she didn't say anything at the deaf church she visited, she responded with 'i'm a whore' instead of 'i'm shy'. like that whole spanish "i'm pregnant" instead of "i'm embarrassed" thing. this is what goes on in my brainmeats. really? performance anxiety in another freakin language?

no not taking friends and statifying them just had an idea for a new shadowrunner character: deaf computer programmer sells his/her sword as a hacker/rigger to pay for new auditory implants (old ones died, need cash for new upgrades). high perception, also comes in handy during negotiations due to reading body language. uses a small ladybug/dragonfly-sized drone to detect auditory signals, relays to the artificial reality goggle interface (like, car approaching, gunshots fired, sirens, etc). maybe an elf; high charisma, with some face attributes to be the negotiator for stuff. debating on technomancer/awakened, but probably too many points into one character.

 i'm done spending all the things. ikea attacked me with a price sticker and now i have a nice scratch on my elbow.

 argh. remaking the miter sled because my 90s are not enough 90 for me. also, awkward. so i'll work on that, maybe. somehow. 
(comment on this)thursday, august 15th, 201312:47 am
measure twice, glue onc-ah, hell. so i tried to make a miter sled for the saw, and i goofucked up. not sure how bad yet, going to wait for daylight. the piece on the right doesn't square with the piece on the left when i looked at it just now, the framing square doesn't touch on the right leg. shit. so this means that any picture frames made with this will be gappy, and visible. shiiiiiit. and since i glued it, i can't redo it. second problem: the thing is backheavy and falls off the saw when i slide it back. may just end up doing another version of this (i have more hardboard to make the base out of) with a longer base, or put a 'fence' at the other end to counterbalance. shit. thought things were going well on this. dammit.

(comment on this)thursday, august 8th, 20133:52 pm
measure 5 times cut twice son of a bitch. aunt gave me an old cabinet made out of pressboard and snot with mouldings on half the bottom (unstable, needs a base) as it was screwed in to the floor and wall as part of a row of cabinets. bought lumber to make a new base as it's the type with a toe-kick and i don't want to bolt it in as it's probably not going to stay in this room. cut the damn dado grooves too deep, now i have to glue a filler strip in for the front and back to sit on and support the weight. dammit! 
(comment on this)10:42 am
get off my lawn two years until the next class reunion. skipped out on the past ones, saying i'll show up for the two-bit, when i'm successsful and all that. yeah, not really seeing that happen right now. got a new friend request, looking through, name sounds familiar but the person does not, from high school? so start looking through friends (like you do), and holy shit i remember some of these people (little brothers/sisters of friends) and holy shit do they all look alike in this family, like the round-face-quirky-eyebrow genes are all i got this. parents, kids, nephews/nieces/niblings, cousins, whatever. still wasn't able to find a few classmates, so not sure if that means that they're not online or permanently offline. :(so. yeah. another cheerful day here.
