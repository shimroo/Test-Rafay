the fort ord reuse authority (fora) 

"when fora goes away" by jerry bowden
                        


 executive officer's message

                        
the fort ord reuse authority is concluding its 26-year effort to oversee the monterey bay regional economic recovery from the closure of the fort ord army installation. 
in that time period significant accomplishment have been achieved. while many might wish for additional or different outcomes, it is appropriate to reflect on what has been accomplished through our grand experiment converting swords
                            to plowshares. 
what has been accomplished could not have happened without the dedication and leadership of generations of elected leaders, engaged community members and advocacy groups, legions of consultants and legal experts, and a small dedicated
                            team of professional staff.
josh metz, executive officer

in rememberance 
salinas mayor and fort ord reuse authority ("fora") board member joe gunter departed this life peacefully on june 29, 2020 - after 50+ years of an achievement-filled
                            lifetime of family, military, public and educational service. joe served the monterey region in many leadership positions, including; city of salinas mayor, president of the salinas airshow, california rodeo board member, public
                            safety officer and 8-year fora board member.


                        
in support of former fort ord reuse, mayor gunter served on the fora board for eight years, including four years as fora finance committee chair, four years on the legislative committee, six years on the executive committee. joe
                            provided instrumental support for the fort ord base reuse plan, economic development conveyance agreement, and fora capital improvement program. he always emphasized economic development, and creating jobs for all monterey
                            bay citizenry. 
in addition, joe gunter served in the united states marine corps and offered significant advocacy for monterey bay veterans and the work of the fora veterans issues advisory committee, and effectively worked with national and state
                            legislative and appointed leadership for the creation of the california central coast veterans cemetery and other veteransâ programs. he was known for steadfastly maintaining a sense of equitability in all opportunities throughout
                            his personal and professional life. 
on behalf of the fort ord reuse authority, on our last day of existence under state law, we as fora staff and family extend best wishes and condolences to lisa and the gunter family, and our sincerest gratitude to them for sharing
                            mayor joe. his extraordinary contributions and exemplary commitment to the reuse of former fort ord and to the well-being of the whole monterey bay region will benefit us all for years to come. 

former fort ord army base recognized with epa superfund site reuse award 
april 30, 2020
san francisco - today, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) recognized the former fort ord army base with a "national federal facility
                                excellence in site reuse" award. these awards recognize innovative thinking and cooperation among federal agencies, states, tribes, local partners and developers that has led to noteworthy restoration and reuse of federal
                                facility superfund sites. "for the past three years, we've shown how federal facility superfund sites can be transformed into community assets," said epa administrator andrew wheeler. "i'm proud of the work to address and
                                redevelop these sites." "we are pleased to recognize the dynamic cooperation among the u.s. army and local partners to clean up this federal facility and return it to productive use," said epa regional administrator john
                                busterud. "this is a unique superfund cleanup in that the army early-on in the process transferred approximately 3,340 acres of the former base to the fort ord reuse authority to complete the cleanup on behalf of the army.
                                with a significant federal grant, the reuse authority was able to accelerate the pace of cleanup, allowing this part of the site to be made available for public reuse sooner than would have been otherwise possible."
