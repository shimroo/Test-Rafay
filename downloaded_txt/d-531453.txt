stuff i saw





there's a new chairman of the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts, one of the crown jewels of our nation's performing arts community. you're likely familiar with him, as he seems to suck the oxygen from...all the things. as with everything that chairman touches, i expect the kennedy center to devolve into a celebration of the gauche, a debauched shell of her former elegant self. i'll miss her.i'll have my memories, though. here's what i believe to be a complete list of the shows and events i took in at that impressive building hard by the potomac river.took both kids to see a free they might be giants early evening show in the grand foyer in october 2010. the occasion was a celebration of the comprehensive redesign of artsedge—the kennedy center’s national k-12 arts education web site. which is probably fucked. there's a video of the (impressively long and predictably fun) show available here.in january 2013, i took my little one to see a joyous and high-energy celebration of the 40th anniversary of schoolhouse rock at the millennium stage. turns out shlara was there, too, though neither of us realized the other was in the house.2016 was a big year for us and the kencen. started on new year's day with matilda in the opera house. dark and funny. and dark.it's a great venue. and it ain't gonna look like this for a while.my then 15 year-old dancer and i attended a premiere of the national ballet of canada's 'a winter's tale' later that january. my company at the time was headquartered in toronto and a major sponsor of the ballet's tour, so we got vip tickets which entitled us to backstage passes after the show. my kid has never been speechless before or since, but she was that evening meeting the cast.we went as a family to see fiasco theatre's incredibly inventive production of into the woods in december of that same year. here's a snippet from a glowing review by andra abramson: "the updated into the woods directed by noah brody and ben steinfeld is so fresh and innovative and so superbly acted that i was immediately swept up in the action and transported to a fairy tale world of witches, bakers, princesses, giants, and mysterious men." it really was one of the most captivating stage plays i've ever seen.the exact date has escaped my recollection, but i took my college-aged artist to see the alvin ailey american dance theatre perform revelations. i've grown to appreciate all forms of dance, and other than my kid's first full piece of choreography, this was the most moving version of the form i've seen.lost to time, as well, the date of a holiday-time performance of les miserables, a huge, ambitious staging full of big sound, complex sets, and wild lighting. my wife and i saw hamilton there in october 2022. it wasn't the room where it first happened, and it wasn't the original cast, but it was still unlike anything i've seen on stage before.i hope very much to get back to that venerable building. but as long as that fucking guy has anything to do with it, i shan't lighten its doorstep. like a great many things at the moment, it's a shame.

i can't believe we need a paul engelmayer tag





this is my third paul engelmayer post so i created a tag for him.  to recap, he's a judge in the southern district of new york, which is the federal district court for manhattan.  i've described his accomplishments previously.  on saturday he granted a temporary restraining order requested by several state attorneys general:enjoining the defendants [donald trump and scott bessent] during the pendency of this action from granting to political appointees, special government employees, and any government employee detailed from an agency outside the treasury department access to treasury department payment systems or any other data maintained by the treasury department containing personally identifiable information .... it's pretty clear that engelmayer's order bars appointees and employees from outside the treasury department--the part i bolded modifies the preceding three categories of people.  he then further clarified this statement by writing:the defendants are (i) restrained from granting access to any treasury department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the treasury department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees, other than to civil servants with a need for access to perform their job duties within the bureau of fiscal services who have passed all background checks and security clearances and taken all information security training called for in federal statutes and treasury department regulations; (ii) restrained from granting access to all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the treasury department, to any treasury department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the treasury department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees; and (iii) ordered to direct any person prohibited above from having access to such information, records and systems but who has had access to such information, records, and systems since january 20, 2025, to immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the treasury department’s records and systems, if any ....again, it's pretty clear that engelmayer's order only applies to people outside of treasury, and to people inside of treasury who haven't gone through all the vetting and training required to handle confidential information.  and if these types of people have this particular confidential information, they should destroy it.but we live in the dumbest timeline of the maga cinematic universe so stupidity ensued.  doge's doofus overlord called for him to be impeached.  of course, trump offered the opinion that engelmayer is "crazy" for temporarily restraining an unelected, unconfirmed ketamine addict working at a fictional government department from having unfettered access to the united states' money supply.and then there's this:tom cotton and adrian vermeule got their undergraduate and law degrees at harvard.  jd vance graduated summa cum laude from ohio state and got his jd at yale.  all three of these guys can read and understand engelmayer's order.  they know it doesn't bar bessent from accessing treasury systems unless he hasn't completed the required background checks and training, in which case it likely maintains the status quo--you can't do that job and access all the secret stuff until you've completed all the security requirements.  and they know this isn't judicial interference, it's a tro.  it's temporary.  this means the requesting party showed they will suffer irreparable harm so the judge made the other party pause to maintain the status quo for a few days while we figure out what the hell is going on. most importantly, they know this is exactly what the judiciary is supposed to do--determine what the law says and whether any particular act conflicts with it.  it's been this way for over 200 years, we learned that in high school.these ivy league schmucks need to watch more schoolhouse rock.or maybe they watched it and took the circus metaphor too far by staffing the endeavor with a bunch of clowns.  maybe i'm the clown.  remember when i said elections have consequences?

unsightly, un-saintly





[ed. note - as always, we cover the world's major sporting events like no other outlet. in that spirit, please enjoy our coverage of super bowl lix, starting with this heartwarming tale from our man in the sand.]in the realm of inconvenient news, the new orleans saints email dump is a dandy little listeria outbreak next to the food tent at the county fair. as the nfl and a sizeable chunk of the sports media world descended on the crescent city for the super bowl, it was revealed that the saints’ front office worked closely with the city’s catholic church to minimize damage from a scandal involving predatory priests.
team officials regularly counseled church hierarchy on public relations efforts and were far more involved than they previously admitted, according to internal emails obtained by the associated press. the scandal came to light in 2018 when the archdiocese of new orleans released a list of priests accused of sexual abuse after hundreds of claims of molestation, many among minors and children, that stretched back decades.
the ap first reported in 2020 that saints’ officials had advised the archdiocese, but owner gayle benson denied that anyone associated with the franchise “made recommendations or had input” on the list of identified priests and had only minimal involvement. the saints’ internal emails, however, reveal a year-long effort that included the names of priests on the list before they were made public, and the team president provided talking points and a list of questions that archbishop gregory aymond should expect from reporters. also, the team’s communications vice president regularly provided updates to his bosses about church business and interviews. he called in favors with local media and urged media members to “work with” the church during the scandal, while signaling that team and church leaders were aligned. after the ap’s current report, the saints released a lengthy statement that criticized the media for using “leaked emails for the purpose of misconstruing a well-intended effort.” no one within the saints’ organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred, the statement said, and any perceived partnership between the team and archdiocese no longer exists. translation: you nosy snoops are being unfair to us about something that happened waaaaay back in the last decade. nfl commish roger goodell earlier this week essentially sidestepped the issue when asked about the report and the saints’ more extensive role in the fallout of the scandal. he said that benson and the saints are very involved in the community and “great corporate citizens.” he mentioned benson’s catholic faith and deep church connections (aymond introduced benson to her husband and the team’s longtime owner, the late tom benson, and has been a frequent guest in the locker room and on the owners’ private jet). goodell said the matter was up to the fbi and local and national law enforcement, and he praised benson’s transparency concerning the emails. “i leave it to (the saints), but i am confident that they are playing nothing more than a supportive role to help be more transparent in circumstances like this.” amid the remarks about transparency, he omitted the part where the saints went to court to prevent their emails from becoming public.
nfl teams engage in public relations in their sleep and forever attempt to finesse and manipulate the populace and its representatives – publicly financed stadia, tax breaks, sponsorships, media rights, broadcasting, licensing, merchandise. some we see, much we don’t. it’s probably an upset that more ill-considered, if not disgusting, decisions and activities don’t come to light. the combination of great piles of money and civic adulation mostly keeps the expensive suits pointed in the same direction and minimizes boardroom pie fights.
it’s reprehensible for an nfl franchise to help massage the image of an organization that covered up a sex abuse scandal it was aware of for years, but you knew this is how it would be dealt with. goodell is nominally the commissioner, but the truth is that he works for the owners, and he isn’t about to say or do anything that might rankle the billionaires without permission. a largely compliant media will nibble around the edges of unpleasant topics but prefers to focus on things such as a chiefs’ three-peat or the legend of saquon. in a just society, the saints would be punished and vilified and held up as an object lesson in how not to behave. instead, they’re lauded as “great corporate citizens” trying to lend support and beneficiaries of the notion that wealthy organizations must be protected and are more important than people. an nfl franchise and the catholic church is one hell of a tag team. would that either actually lived up to the image they project.

the latest eo's -- your excremental orders from the great leader





breaking newswashington, dc – this just in from the ovaltine office. your man in the know, el whitdoggimus, whose ai-deemed pseudonym is "whitney," has gotten ahold of the next batch of executive orders from the once and future president for life, lord god king bu-fu donald john "don's johns" trump. as a service to gheorghies and g:tb readers worldwide, we are leaking these 11 soon-to-be-issued orders on this venerable blog.here we go.*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the united states of america, and to improve the well-being and future success of america, it is hereby ordered:1. roy cohn day. a previously issued executive order banned activities related to juneteenth, black history month, and every other ethno-cultural recognition event, including martin luther king jr. day. accordingly, mlk day is now replaced with roy cohn day. roy cohn day will be held every february 20 to commemorate the birthday of the man who helped shape the mind that started this amazing train in motion. mcdonald's will have free ice cream cones all day on roy cohn day. patrons need only ask, "where's my roy cohn?" (only available in vanilla.) they'll call them cohn's cones. it'll be tremendous. 2. lunar labor camps. a previously issued order began the aggressive arrest, holding, and immediate deportation of undocumented migrant residents and any non-citizens. this order is being amended to assign these individuals to spacex (space exploration technologies corporation) and deploy them on the moon. forced labor camps are being set up on the moon to build mar-a-luno, a five-star trump property. it's gonna be great. best in the galaxy. you're gonna love it. 3. repurposing of mosques and other non-judeo-christian religious buildings. the takeover of gaza by the unites states expected to happen by roy cohn day 2025, and the relocation of 1.8 million palestinians currently residing in gaza to humanitarian countries or to u.s. lunar labor camps via spacex, will render unnecessary the divisive, threatening, unamerican religious buildings those people also inhabit domestically. any structure in the united states that has until now been a congregation center for religions other than christianity (and in some smaller, high-profile, press-happy, photo-op cases, judaism) will be seized by federal agents or the military and repurposed into free-market hubs of commerce and capitalism. very specifically they will all become units of trumptowne™, exclusive clubs for real americans where citizens can buy trump™ brand products: collections of coins, t-shirts, hats, thongs, ascots, false teeth, tiaras, crocs, mullet bands, cummerbunds, and prophylactics all emblazoned with make america great again™ or trump president for life™. this will end the long-standing pattern of death and destruction and, frankly, bad luck, that these people have had and have caused in america. 4. late-night comedy regulation. all late-night american comedy television programming will be regulated and replaced at the discretion of the president. you see these terribly unfunny, not funny at all people on television such as jon stewart, seth meyers, stephen colbert, jimmy kimmel, bill maher, and many others, occasionally jimmy fallon though he made a lot of fun of joe biden and that was very good. these unfunny people will be replaced by sean hannity and megyn kelly and some merit-based trump family members with musical guest ted nugent in a new show everyone's gonna love that makes fun of nancy pelosi and anthony fauci and hunter biden. network writers who are found through federal investigation to have written jokes that insult president trump or minister of propaganda musk will be forcibly commissioned to the executive office to help creatively explain the wisdom behind all of these executive orders. 5. confederate statue replacement. every site that had a confederate statue criminally removed, which served as a terrible tragedy standing in the way of our historical recognition of some very fine people on both sides of that war, will now have that statue replaced. it will be replaced with a statue of president donald j. trump dressed in the traditional attire of general in chief, which was robert e. lee's title until he surrendered, which president trump never would have, he was a great man, but the president would have done things differently. this uniform is the purest tribute to the confederate states of america but also being reimagined by barron trump, he has taken some civil war reenactment fashion classes and he is very good, very, very good. 6. department of education exceptions. after the u.s. department of education is dismantled, the federal government will leave it up to states to ensure english is the only language being taught and that some math is in the curriculum, that's always important in business and those things. history books and history lesson plans, however, must be approved by the president's elite guard of political soldiers and super smrt people. they will only accept the proper accounting of historical american names, to include: crooked hillary, sleepy joe, slick willie, obama bin laden, and robert f. kennedy jr.'s uncle. covid will be removed from history because everything is totally fine now because president trump made it go away and we don't need to talk about it. 7. roadway regulations. all roadways, from neighborhood streets to interstate highways, have a new right-of-way pattern. right-of-way will always be granted to the larger vehicle with additional right-of-way privileges for cybertrucks™, limousines, flatbeds, disproportionately large tires, dangerously extended trailer hitches, emissions violations, horns that play dixie, florida or texas plates, trump vance stickers, and/or truck nuts. hybrid vehicles will never have any right of way and should be dropped off for demolition. 8. more holidays. january 6 will forever be regarded as "a date which will live in famy" and will be another federal holiday, along with cohn day on february 20 and billionaire day on april 1, commemorating the date in 2006 when president donald j. trump became a billionaire even though forbes and bloomberg were falsely reporting assets to be much lower because they're jealous of amazing success. oh, and president's day is now president trump's day. buy a trump™ mattress, you'll never sleep so good as you do, it's tremendously comfortable springs and cushion stuff in there.9. alcoholic beverage commission regulation. bud light is now illegal. 10. correcting radical, wasteful terminology. (a) private equity firms must now be called private moneymaking firms. (b) diversifying your portfolio must now be termed mixing things up. (c) the department of transportation is now officially termed the department of portation. this should fix a lot of things, it will make many, many people very, very happy. 11. title. president of the united states is not a title courageous and powerful enough for a man of donald trump's stature. while in power, idi amin had as his official title: his excellency, president for life, field marshal al hadji doctor idi amin dada, vc, dso, mc, lord of all the beasts of the earth and fishes of the seas and conqueror of the british empire in africa in general and uganda in particular. this is very good but too long, people will get it wrong, and plus the africa stuff and fishes, we don't need that. mr. trump will now be called forever more: his excellency, president for life, feel marshal super good doctor donald trump daddy, md, phd, bmoc, pg, vsop, handsome lord of all the beasts of the earth and conqueror of the democrats in america and the world, amen. idi amin also claimed to be the uncrowned king of scotland. donald trump is also the king of greenland. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *wow. seems like a lot of stuff, wonder if he can get them all implemented without any pushback. okay, well, hope everyone's doing super-spectacular in 2025!whitdog, out

self-care





i've been trying to write a post about *waves hands* all the shit happening in our country at the moment, but every time i start, some new monkey feces gets thrown at the wall by the gleeful fascist gibbons running the place and i have to formulate a new theory. let me note for the record (for at least as long as the internet remains plugged in) that i think we're deeply fucked for at least some period of time - not so much because of that those in power are doing, but because the response of the opposition party and media has been and continues to be so abjectly inadequate to meet the moment. bygones.so instead, a bit of artistic good news to keep the content train moving while the good monkeys bang away at keyboards for your amusement. jason isbell's first solo record in 10 years, foxes in the snow, will be released on march 7. here's the first track from the fully acoustic album to hit the free world, "bury me". it's stripped down storytelling, very isbell, and very good.
