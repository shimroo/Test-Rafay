our goal: to make sibo diagnoses accessible to canadians
at sibo canada, we believe that access to test kits for the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) should be readily available for canadian physicians and patients. we provide the resources so that you no longer have to ship samples to the usa or seek out another clinic for sibo testing. 

become a referring practitioner







we supply quintron easysampler breath test kits to physicians and patients.
this allows patients to collect samples at home and mail their completed kits back to our laboratory for analysis. 
full colour copies of test results are provided to the referring practitioner through a secure medical database, making it easy to receive, review, and download results.
 

how testing works













we provide an extensive list of referring practitioners from each province
making it easy for patients to find the help they need.





find a provider














no referring doctor? no problem.
order test kits and access customized treatment plans through treat sibo clinic without a doctor’s referral.
