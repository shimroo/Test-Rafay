 the amenities are nice, but the real star of the show at coffee mill golf course is the top-tier golf layout. to the world outside wabasha, the name coffee mill did not mean much and certainly didn’t convey the vast views we know here at coffee mill golf course. the course is situated along the edge of numerous bluffs and ridges two miles west of wabasha on hwy 60, at the point where the mighty mississippi river and commanding chippewa valley collide. the result is bluff country views that extend for 50 miles.originally designed in 1966 as a 9-hole course, coffee mill golf course has always enjoyed the reputation as one of the finest golf courses in southeastern minnesota. in 2003, the addition of 9 more holes and a clubhouse facility made the experience that much greater. now, as an 18-hole course with true golf amenities — including a 275-yard grass driving range (which can accommodate large groups 125 for sit down or 200 for standing) and a full-service bar and outdoor patio — coffee mill golf course is made for a true and complete golf experience.
