our specialized acute care

while most patients in a traditional hospital are able to go home or to a lower level of care within a few days, patients with complex conditions may need additional time to recover in an acute care setting.  that's where we come in. 
our physician-led care teams provide critically ill patients with the specialized care they need, for the time they need it – empowering them to take the next step in their recovery journeys.

our commitment to excellence
demonstrating our commitment to providing safe, high-quality quality patient care, all kindred hospitals have achieved at least one disease-specific care certification from the joint commission. this includes most of our hospitals being certified in the care of respiratory failure and sepsis. certification ensures a standardized, evidence-based approach to care and to performance measurement and improvement.
