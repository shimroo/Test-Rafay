welcome to sunny
san diego


san diego is often referred to as “america’s finest city,” and for good reasons!
picture perfect weather, miles upon miles of sandy beaches, cool ocean breezes, dozens of fun and educational attractions, and a consummate laid-back attitude attract more than 30 million visitors annually. part of that draw is an average temperature that varies little from 70 degrees and only 42 rainy days per year. the city retains an intimate charm with charismatic neighborhoods and communities such as carlsbad, coronado, del mar, the gaslamp quarter, point loma, chula vista, old town, la jolla, north park, and many others. these neighborhoods have unique identities that combine to create a city rich in exploration and diversity.
visitors enjoy popular family destinations, including legoland, the san diego zoo, petco park, scripps aquarium, sea world, uss midway museum, and cultural attractions that dot the city, including 18 museums spanning 1,200 acres in world-class balboa park. others come to play, relax, explore, and go on unique adventures. world-class beaches and waterfront attractions attract throngs of surfers, sunbathers, kayakers, and divers.
san diego is here and waiting for you.
