often, banking can seem impersonal but not with us.

when our customers come to us for help, they’re looking for immediate answers. they don’t need to wait days for decisions to be made somewhere else, they’ve come for the response we provide then and there.

                                        phone/phishing scam
local residents, and other people in various parts of the u.s., have been receiving phone, text, cell, and internet solicitations from individuals stating that their card has been compromised and needs to be deactivated.  then the victim is asked to provide their credit card number and/or other personal information that can be used to commit identity theft.
as a reminder, hometown bank will never ask for personal information over the phone, in a text or through an email.
