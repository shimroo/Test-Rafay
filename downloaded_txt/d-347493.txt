                recordings of rachmaninoff concertos no. 2 & 3.
              arguably the finest renditions of these works and certainly the
              most technically brilliant, transparent and imaginative
              interpretations even when compared to famed horowitz and
              rachmaninoff discs.
              until is passing in 1995, shura cherkassky was considered as the
              last representative of the golden age of the piano. still today,

              superb pianism, imagination and the ability to make well known
              works sound fresh and delightful.
              cherkassky had a distinguish lineage leading all the way to liszt

mordecai shehori plays bach, vol. 3

the well-tempered clavier, book
                  2.  
preludes & fugues 1-12
"few pianists have devoted themselves to the mastery of touches
                in the quest for clean, unmannered articulation as shehori, and
                i recommend a close study of his fugue in a major, bwv 864
                as an example. the supple elements of the line resolve en route
                with natural landings, as gratifying as the stretti
                that precede the final cadence. if another analogy will suffice
                besides an organ composition, consider the writing in the
                expansive a minor fugue, bwv 865 as an animated vocal
                motet, with leading baritone lines. the sudden transition to the
                b-flat major prelude, bwv 866 could not be more
                dramatic, with its toccata elements and singing and declamatory
                flourishes, almost a study for the bwv 903 chromatic
                  fantasy. once more, as a modern example of
                scholarship-become-high art, this fusion of gnostic musical
                spirits demands our appreciation and aesthetic acknowledgement."

mordecai shehori plays bach, vol. 1

the well-tempered clavier, book

preludes & fugues 1-12  
frã©dã©ric chopin's hand written annotations to bach's
                  well-tempered clavier, book 1

              these performances of j. s. bachâs well-tempered clavier were
              inspired and guided by frã©dã©ric chopinâs hand written annotations
              in a teaching score which belonged to his student pauline
              chazaren, as well as by a study of numerous editions and the
              autographâs facsimile. my main concept of bachâs music considers
              his work within the larger view of the arts, architecture,
              literature, and religious philosophies of his time. preparations
              involve a thorough study of not only the many types of musical
              instruments that were available to him, but more importantly, his
              documented relentless pursuit to improve those instruments in
              areas of tone color, volume, sustain, the ability to overlap
              tones, and added richness in overtones. it seems that bachâs
              pursuits were aimed at realizing an ability to produce a singing
              line on a keyboard instrument.

                cembal d'amour, cd 152
mordecai shehori, piano

an historically significant release!
it took 169 years since its initial
                publication but it is finally here: the first recording ever of
                the complete âmethode des methodesâ by moschelã¨s and fã©tis.
pianist mordecai shehori performs
                  the complete moschelã¨s and fã©tis âmethode des methodesâ â 20
                  ãtudes de perfectionnement 
(etudes for attaining
                perfection/refinement/sophistication)
in 1838, the pianist, composer and theorist
              franã§ois-joseph fã©tis (25 march 1784 â 26 march 1871), together
              with the celebrated pianist, composer, conductor and pedagogue ignaz
                moschelã¨s collaborated on an ingenious project of
              commissioning twelve renowned pianists/composers of their time: chopin,
                thalberg, mendelssohn, liszt, rosenhain, dã¶hler, heller, wolff,
                henselt, mã©reaux, benedict, and taubert, to create one
              or two etudes each (chopin composed three) concentrating on what
              each one considered the most vital element(s) of refined piano
              playing. 
              fã©tis wrote an extensive analysis (now lost) of the history and
              direction of piano technique and esthetics up to their time, and
              moschelã¨s arranged the etudes with great mastery according to
              their moods, texture, and most importantly, tonalities, so that
              they formed into a single large musical structure.
              it resulted in a unique and significant collection named âmethod
              of methods.ââ  the title certainly lives up to its claim by opening
              a rare window into the 19th century golden age of the piano
              concepts, style and philosophy.â  by intense study of these works
              or even by listening alone, one can get a clear picture of how
              music was conceived and performed in that era.
              this work also allows us to understand with greater depth the
              three celebrated composers that made it to our times, namely
              chopin, liszt and mendelssohn.â  we must remember that such
              greatness could not develop in an artistic vacuum but was in fact
              a result of fertile exchanges of ideas with the now mostly
              forgotten other ten composers.

              tchaikovsky's "eugene onegin" without reliable fingers. still,
              mindless and heartless keyboard fluency is not uncommon nowadays
              and perhaps never was. what sets mr. shehori apart from most
              virtuosos with their off-the-shelf performances is the poetic
              inwardness and rapturous intensity of his playing.â

 cembal d'amour, cd 170
mordecai shehori, piano

 
a new recording of the complete chopin etudes based on a
                thorough study of the stichvorlage (fair copy
                autographs, located at the fryderyk chopin
                museum in warsaw)  
studyingâ  chopinâs autographs
              although not all the etudes are actually in chopinâs hand writing,
              his ink corrections, and pedal markings are evident in all of
              them. there are hundreds of disagreements between the facsimiles
              and even the urtext edition of henle and others.â  the most
              frequent errors are found in henleâs stubbornness in striving for
              symmetry while chopin invariably employed asymmetrical patterns by
              making tiny changes in articulation markings, in varying locations
              of ritardandos and accelerandos or even the absence of them in
              repeating passages. moreover, all editions including henle are
              quite careless about the direction of stems that are vital for
              correct voice leading.

(2 cds set)
 this recording of the early (1827) and final
                (1852) versions of the transcendental etudes presents a rare
                side-by-side opportunity to witness lisztâs genius, first as a
                young teenager with his opus 1, and his development to artistic
                maturity, innovation, and power with the final version of the
                transcendental etudes. the impromptu brillant on themes by
                rossini and spontini, opus 3 (1825) is included since it pairs
                with transcendental etude no. 7 âeroicaâ, and demonstrates the
                enormous influence that italian opera composers had on liszt and
                chopin, among other music greats.

mordecai shehori, piano



mordecai shehori plays bach,
          vol. 4
the well-tempered clavier, book 2. 

preludes & fugues 13-24

                "i spent much of the last few days listening to mordecai
                shehori's miraculous recording of bach's 48 preludes and fugues.
                to say he has has reconciled the functions of the harpsichord in
                the context of its era with the abilities of the modern piano,
                while conveying every systole of musical meaning in a manner
                commensurate with the demands of period style, expressive
                nuance, and meaning - right down to the antiphonal role played
                by acoustics in the presentation of bach's choral music where
                registration and position of the choruses at various places
                throughout the church were just as important to musical meaning
                as the notes and rhythms (so ingeniously codified in the
                keyboard music) - is an understatement. shehori music making
                defines the meaning and importance of micro dynamics to this
                music as well, to speak nothing of that of the contrapuntal
                melody. if i were stalin, i would order a decree compelling
                everyone on the planet to buy this set - at once!"
