audiences love it 



on parade the top hats stroll, saunter, dance, and interact with the crowd. heads turn and toes start to tap when their unique street sound is heard. in concert they play it all, from big band to rock, jazz, and classical favourites. the top hats love to entertain and, since 1982, have had rave reviews from audiences in cities across canada, the us, and even bermuda.
