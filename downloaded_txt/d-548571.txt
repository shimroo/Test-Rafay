victorian bed lamps are custom 
    made lampshades that fit over the headboard of your bed or they can be used 
    over the top of a mirror or mounted on the wall.  






bridge lamps with uno 
                fitters are hard to find and antique bridge lamp shades are 
                often unusable.  our vintage bridge lamp shades are made to 
                look and feel like the original shades.

antique lampshade 
                restoration is an area in which we have considerable 
                experience.  working on authentic antique lampshades has 
                shown us much about the antique artistry involved in making 
                shades a century ago.  we strive to duplicate this vintage 
                look.   











"too much is 
          never enough"

i just wanted to tell you that 
                i received the shade in perfect shape...i have been away on 
                vacation and am only now getting to tell you that the shade is 
                just breathtaking! every day i fall more in love with it...it's 
                perfect for the room!  
i really appreciate the way that you worked with me throughout 
                the process and were able to envision what i wanted. i was a 
                little nervous about trying to do a custom shade over the 
                internet, but it couldn't have been a more inclusive and 
                interactive process.  
thanks, i love love love it! -michele
