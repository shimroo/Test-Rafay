arizona voice for crime victims has truly established the standard of “justice for all – even the victim.” 




    avcv services
  

 

in 1996, steve twist and sen. jon kyl shaped the future of non-profit victim services when they founded arizona voice for crime victims (avcv). avcv was the first organization, both in arizona and across the country, to provide both pro bono legal representation and social services to victims of crime for the purpose of asserting and enforcing victims’ constitutional rights. after 25 years of litigating victims’ rights, avcv’s legal team consists of arizona’s most experienced victims’ rights attorneys. avcv’s appellate practice has resulted in published case authority that has preserved and protected victims’ constitutional rights to justice and due process. as our legal team works to ensure that victims have an opportunity for meaningful participation throughout the criminal justice process, our social services team provides victims with a sense of hope, encouragement, and security as they wait for justice to be served.
