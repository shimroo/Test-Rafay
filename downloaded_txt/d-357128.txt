our
low cost dc heater controller or tec controller (tecc). when used
with peltier modules  this small
controller with proportional bandwidth and integral gain is an
inexpensive way to keep cool and it can handle up to 24v and 7.5a. this
is perfect for cooling small enclosures to a fixed temperature such as
keeping an enclosure from going above room temperature. if you need to
heat and also cool to maintain the temperature use the 5r7-570 (left)
or 5r7-001 (above).












benchtop
temperature controller with
settable voltage


ac voltage temperature controllers


 

 
 
 
the
benchtop 5c7-195 temperature
controller
is the easiest way to get started with peltier modules, or dc voltage
heaters.
at only $795, this controller works over 4 temperature ranges and also
has a digital, adjustable voltage range. primarily developed to help
our
customers define their oem requirements, it's small size of
approximately
8" x 7" x 2.5" and the front panel controls help to make this
controller
suitable for many applications, and it is convenient for becoming
familiar
with peltier modules, university courses, and r&d.

our
expanding line
of digital temperature controllers for thermoelectric devices, fans and
resistive heaters ...


innovative
and cost effective customization...



our decades of experience
in building pulse width modulated temperature
controllers has resulted in new, state-of-the-art, digital controllers
for heaters and coolers that run on a dc voltage. the addition of our
proportional
control setting makes these controllers superior to simple bang-bang
controllers
(on/off, which is an optional setting) so that you now have safe,
efficient,
and reliable control for peltier modules and other dc devices.
we were one of the first to supply low cost, pc
compatible,
and also
custom tec controllers (tecc) for thermoelectric devices, and have been
doing so since 1999. 
compared to analog controllers, these digital
controllers
offer lower
heat dissipation and lower prices. our pc compatible versions are rich
in features that can be accessed through our setup program, or your own
custom program.
with the pc programmable controllers, we provide
unique extras
so that
you can have your first controller up and running fast. 
all controllers can be customized and custom
built.

unlimited potential 
quality custom solutions and outsourcing: if you
are building
a controller

zero voltage switching
(or zero voltage firing)

zero voltage switching means that the power to the load (heater or cooloer or other device) is switched on
or off only when the output voltage is zero volts.
zero voltage switching can extend the life of a controller and of the load being congtrolled.
controllers with zero voltage switching use triacs or other solid-state relays instead of mechanical relays,
and, in fact, all of our temperature controllers which use a triac are inherently zero voltage switching.
with ac current, the voltage is zero 50 to 60 times per second. for example, with 120vac at 60hz the voltage
swings from 0 volts to -120 volts to 0 volts to +120 volts and back to 0 volts 60 times per second. the controller
only turns the power to the load on or off when the voltage is zero. (since the cycle described above repeats
itself, there are, at 60 hz, 120 times every second that the ac voltage is at zero volts and power switching
can occur.
with dc power, as used with thermoelectric controllers, the dc voltage is first converted by the controller
to dc pwm (dc voltage that is pulse width modulated). the voltage repeatedly goes from a positive or negative voltage
to zero volts, and so this type of output power can also be switched on or off when the voltage is zero. the
frequency of these pulses is high enough that the effecton the peltier device approximates that of dc
power (without pulsing), and so pulsing the voltage in this way does not harm the peltier device.
zero voltage switching has an advantage over the kind of switching that would normally be accomplished
with a coil relay beacuse there is a reduced chance for electrical arcing. a relay could turn te power
on when the voltage is high and then an electrical arc (spark) could result.
