hello friends.  outdoors show at brown’s island, with the hottest summer on record to date, to indoors with ac! word from avail:  “"over the james 2024 has been moved indoors to the national based on the likelihood of formidable weather. much like this summer, the past two years have been brutally hot and thunderstorms have resulted in evacuations and shortened sets. we're looking to avoid that with a full 6 band bill. all tickets are transferable and no action is required. there is a small number of tickets remaining so grab those while you can from thenationalva.com or plan9.... we'll see you soon”.
