our 5th grade students participated in a living wax museum presentation. ms. musil and mr. kondraschow’s students read biographies of famous people, wrote essays, and prepared speeches to help create and prepare for their “wax museum.” both parents and students marveled at the amazing wax figures and their fantastic speeches. it was a wonderful morning seeing the students' hard work come to life in such a creative and engaging way.
