who we are

catharine lorillard wolfe (1828-1887) was a prominent new york philanthropist and art collector, and the only woman among the 106 founders of the metropolitan museum of art. in addition to bequeathing her painting collection to the museum, ms. wolfe left an endowment to grace church in manhattan to promote “women’s work.” at the urging of rector dr. william reed huntington and several parishioners, the catharine lorillard wolfe art club was established in 1896. the purpose at the time was to provide aid, counsel and exhibition opportunities to young women artists in new york city.
