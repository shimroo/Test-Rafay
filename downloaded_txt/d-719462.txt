wine vent complain. that's this post random headlines in email... 





short breif opening  - i have this site that sends me emails - patch.. most i think heard of it but one can not be sure i'm not anyone but myself.  
lately i have been tasked with some of the most difficult siutations in my life. and oddly going to conserversal stuff and standing my unpopular ground has helped me build some sort of confidence. even if my accounts get banned due to well my own stupidity and poor choice of words. ( words are not and never have bene a strong suit for me) yet no one wants to find out what i mean they would rather assume. so in a sence fuck them!  my boundry is set if you don't care to find out what i mean and want to assume to hell with ya! i wish you no harm but i will not waste what little time i have left on earth trying to explain myself to the ignornant. just really not worth my time.

back to my way of coping. 

it's typing and bitching and whining and making my opinions known. not to hide under a rock...



hehehe-- so today i opened my reddit and got a wonderful comment about some abortion topic. i only said i feel most people have a hard time coping with death thats why people care so muich about what others do with their life. i find most people in the world today mentally ill.   death is a normal part of life and yes it sucks! yet we all will die. and not many of us get to pick how. if someone is murdered that person being murdered didn't get to pick either. life happens deal with it and learn to cope with death in a better way. so you don't be well emotionally retarded.  but the person told me and it brighted my day.  wow i never seen it from that perspective. that helps me have more compassion to these people and less anger.  firstly i was geeked someone listened to me. and now they liked what i had to say. omg i'm not sure what to do i'm not use to that.. i'm use to being shut down and ignored. now what.. omg i do'tn think i'm ready to be heard. (yes i am) hehee but i can't help but have doubts still.  i mean just yesterday my account was banned on reddit because i said if you want me to cut parts of my body up then i want you to mount your penis on my mantal. i never said cut. the mods assumed that. or implied that's what i meant well if you want me to cut into myself why can't you do the same? i'm not fighting with anyone and saying cut off your limb and hang it on my wall .. i just if you want me to harm myself then i want your penis on my wall. never mentioned how but people find it easier to assume then to ask. 

i had a few back and forths with the mod. and they lifted my ban.. however i won't return to that site because not only does it tick me off i don't want to be around people like that. i want people who listen and ask questions and aim to understand instead of placing judgement. 



now for me to place judgment on my own .. but not onto one person. more on society.. so enjoy the rest of my vent. 

email headline in my patch. 







michigan will now donate returned formula to food banks, shelters





policies used to dictate that any unused baby formula returned by wic clients was discarded. now michigan non-profits can benefit from it.













people who returned baby food who were on wic were discarded. hold on did this idea of keeping perfectly fine food is a new idea? why is this not common sence? does someone or group want a cookie for their choices to not be so wasteful?  why is this even headline worthly .. for those who care about appereinces  it makes you look liike you have always been wasteful and makes me question what else do you waste?  



way to go michigan!!!





thats all for now!!

lordy i'm 40... birthday fun and life





well 40 years on planet earth so far has been crazy!!

40 years of having cake shoveled down your throat. like do people listen i don't like cake. sorry! it's not my thing. how many times do i need to mention how much i don't like cake or candy bars it's just not for me. i like to drink my sugar not eat it!  so hot coco,, redbull. now there is my kind of cake!

anyway i did eat cake. it was tasty. really there is dry cake and over frosted cake. but never bad cake. still not my thing i'll eat a bit to shut others up.

so my birthday was awesome!! i got my first gift at midnight. my knife sharpener.  since i'm always in the wild i always feel a need for a shaper knife.  well my wish is granted so currently looking up some ways to sharpen knifes. so many different ways and oils can be used and bla bla bla i got a lot to learn. so then went to bed and woke up to more gifts. crazy spoiled that is me!
i got a tanning package. and that is soooo neeeded. as before you go off thinking how bad tanning is for you. learn why i tan prior to placing judgement. i have psoriasis health insurance covers some up to so many visits to the light box therapy and that is narrow band uvb light treatment. there is a tanning bed by my house that offers uvb lights in their tanning beds it's cheap. so why not. plus it's doctor approved. my flair up this winter is my eye lid. so no i won't be wearing the goggles either. lol  i do'nt even use their lotion i want this to work and it's not like i'm in there for 20 minutes. my goal is to go for 21 minutes a week. 7 minute sessions 3 times a week.
and yes the bonus is the tan! this works for me better than steroid cremes and bio chemicals being injected into my body.. who knows what the bad stuff of that is its' too new for them to know.  and personally i don't want to be a  test subject.

so i'll stick with what wards for me ... wouldn't  you?

moving on. i got 5.4 lbs of alpaca fur.. yep, locally too i can go pet the animal if i want to at apple charlies. the alpaca farm on the grosse ile sold me a bag so why would i want a bag of fur from an animal.
really simple my goals. most of you know my goals of wanting to lean off society. be self reliant and not so dependent on 3rd party sources. my old soul is coming out. well i haven't activitly worked on this goal. in a while. just day dream about how sweet it would be.  yes i know gardening how to prep the dirt to give me the best yield of food. i understand how to can. haven't done it yet. but i do dehydrate my food for later uses.
i'm not a dr yet and most likely won't be. but i can't make things and after learning knitting and crocheting i really don't like that much but can do it if needed. what i do like is making yarn. well i'm a day in to it so we will see it's much funner to me than knitting. but i can't wait to take fur, to yarn, to scarf.. so that is my goal. for this year get threw this bag of fur wash this yarn. make something out of it.
really my mom she can do all that stuff and made a lot of scarfs and gloves and other crazy awesome warm stuff for winter. she ended up with a box of yarn and is going to town this year. i wish i had hear patience.

but yeah mom got me a drop spindle its no wheel  wheels are faster.. but this drop spindle stuff is just too cool to watch and get the feeling of what it takes to hand spin yarn. helps me appreciate the clothing on my back. well home made stuff at least this machine made stuff has no character. it's all the same there is nothing to set it apart. and to me that is boring. pointless money game that i don't want to be a part of anymore in my life.

now i woke up to this gift of a spindle and i knew i was getting it so i have been saving up some cat fur from tux. he is my long haired cat. and it did it worked i spun cat fur. and wanted to spin more. tux hid under the bed after he heard me say maybe if we shave him i'll get more.  but tux.. lol  anway we choice to check out the alpaca farm. and how cool was that place. gail the owner use to race cars indy car racing .. and now she has a farm with the friendly lamas. she showed us around the farm even tho it was freezing cold the lamas where happy and this weather makes their coat so warm and filled. so i'll go back and get more. we got a great deal too i guess. they sell alpaca fur for 1 dollar an ounce.  i got 5.4 lbs for 40 bucks. half off you know it! 

after we left there we went for a tiny hike at the gilbralter bay unit on the island. there is a little trail that goes threw there. no one was there we checked out the pond and the south side of the island marsh area's  the lake was frozen but not enough to walk on. but you can toss sticks out and see if you can hit the swans. you won't we tried. they are too far and there is water out there so you won't get them. we seen some buffelhead ducks threw the view thingy there at the park and noticed they are doing some maintenance there.  a few little bridges or something so no more puddle walking. for an unpaved trail i'm reather happy with it. they keep the mud down and it's always a pleasant walk. and for the small area there are some choose your path. such a great place. and they are starting to remove the fensed in area's too so thats' cool.  on sundays they let you walk threw the air port section with the old sea base spot. normally do a little lunch out there on that cement slab.

on our drive home coming off the island we noticed a big bird in the tree. thought it was my owl at elizabeth park. so of course i pull over i want to see if it's him. it's still cold and as we get out of the car we notice it's not an owl it's a bald eagle. so i got to see a few great wildlife items on my birthday. the eagle the do not feed the deer deer two bucks 6 pointers i want to say maybe 4 they were babies.

then the party.
the party was fun. the day after was also fun i spun yarn all day with dirty alpaca fur!! lol
still have a lot to learn about all of my little projects. but at least i am getting them out there..

below are some photos. enjoy!





alpaca fur raw unwashed




alpaca fur raw unwashed





this is the drop spindle with some of that alpaca fur spun on it.  along with the upclose shot of my work!!  it's a little over twisted in spots. but i think that's okay guess i'll find out. 









birthday eagle!!!







from afar it looks like an owl. 



cool thing he didn't fly away and the people on the trait went around us thought we were a crazy bunch once we told them it was an eagle we seen what we looked like taking photos of a tree with a phone and talking jibberish because we all are so happy to see this icon in a tree watching us like we are watching him.!! 







to my grams.. : thank you for the birthday wishes: your cardinal came out to see me more than once on my special day.. i know your watching me. i hope to make you proud gramma. keep sending my birdies i love every one of them. just like you did <3 p="">




for those who don't know my grams loved red birds (all birds really) i remember being a little girl feeding them with her out by the edge of the woods. it's one of my greatest memories with my grandma and myself. she has been gone a lone time from my life but she never really left.. 



so thats about it i think start at 9am this morning and i guess it's finished. 





now on to my newest hobbie.. making yarn!!!

sharing art work from the usa





i was thinking. why not share more of my recent work in photography. the last few years i have captured a ton of wonderful sites with my travels. please do not steal my work just ask i don't bite! 

show and tell time  yeah!!  i love parks road trips and mountains and trails and well anything nature!!

these are in no order and some i couldn't tell you with out looking at the exif data where they were taken. some i will never forget some i will!! 






















this image above is of angles landing in national park zion if you zoom in you can see people climbing up this rock. even on top. its a hard trail to go up as there are chains and poles and steep drop offs and scary scary ideas of falling. some people have died on this trail. so if you go here don't be stupid. if you drop something it's gone!  



below the image is from the top. look at that view!!! yes it is breath taking. 




here is another shot below of angles landing



















above and below is an ocean off of washington. 







the image above and below are of one of my favorite places.  cape flattery what i love about this place is they used what they had from nature to create the paths. they didn't go to lowes or homedepot and buy stuff that was already right there.    this place shows me hope that humans can live with nature. and have some of the best things in the world this way.      








the above photo is at a hot springs parking lot out side the cabin. 




this is canada.. some random stop we had to take a break from driving to go walking.. cool areas on this spot .. no clue where it is at. assuming the 401 somewhere







just look at how mean the ocean is. so strong so meaningful such purpose!!




i want to say this is somewhat local i'm sure i'm wrong.. 




this is so pretty forgot where it is too but wish i was there now! 




back to canada the reeds or whatnot waved in the wind and it was such a magical feeling with the colors of goldish brown waving over the marshes.  see below for peaks of green!










vermont!!! tmi - i peed here!  by that rock. they didn't have bathrooms and when you got to go. just go.. i don't see why it's a big deal dear and other animals do their dirty outside!




seriously vermont in the fall. glad i got to see this. i will say tho if driving threw canada learn french. the boarder crossing and bridge were out.. almost ran out of gas. due to lack of reading signage in a different language.  lesson learned at least it was fun! 




vermont - there for a wedding. it was freaking cold but that fire kept us warmer!!  





okay thats all i feel like sharing today. enjoy my view threw my eyes! 

yes all photos were enhanced.. or touched up.

inspiration - happy new year - book time





well firstly i would like everyone to check out this ladies blog  https://lindaschaubblog.net/. she is very well written, kind and i read her blog all the time. very inspirational too so i have to share my inspiration when i get it as it could inspire others to bring out their own stories and wonderfulness they bring to this great game of life!

i'm inspired because she is dedicated she always has a new post for me to read but not so much i feel overwhelmed. she posts about stuff i like birds parks walking and it's great to know others out there do care about earth and what it can bring. and she likes to walk!!!
i feel inspired due to her words. how many times have i thought to myself. guided hikes would be a great job. backpacking even better.. since thats not a local option guided hikes forest therapy and time outdoors is something i'm about to quit my job for.   i need this in my life. the outdoors the birds the stillness of sitting in the woods watching a leaf slowly fall to the ground and watching the critter of any kind come walk over it. it helps you slow down and that slow down feeling is or should be everyone's normal. we are humans of nature and need to be more in nature. and more or less away from tv screens and fake id's behind the words of a screen. not saying get rid of the internet i'm saying a healthy balance is key!

so not only am i inspired by writing, i'm inspired for more personal things. my future job change / starting my own business doing something i love. life is way to short to be a person in a chair for 9 hours m-f. although asking my younger-self this is what i wanted. now that my goals were achieved it's time to create new ones. as hard as that is while being settled in complacent isn't an easy task. yet i will conquer it.

happy new year - i have no goals at the moment so i am thinking my main goal for 2019 is to truely figure out what i want to do with my life. i know i should of had this figured out but really when i look back i am past my goals i got what i wanted completed goal. i realize my goal of what i wanted to do with self. has been met. and here i look at myself as a failure why and how so. i set out to get a basic office job with my own office. money was never a thing for me. the amount of money i make is good so good i don't want to give it up. that might just be the challenge i need right now.
but how could i see myself as a failure when i'm just slow to realize i achieved my goals. wow what a great feeling. goals check. but now i need to create more goals thats why i'm in this rut i have no personal goals for myself. other than being my own boss. and nature.  so for this year i'm going to focus on what i want out the next 40 years of my life. i''m on top of my hill with finished goals. not a bad thing!!

well maybe i do have a goal to finish my book i'm writing..
haven't spoken to much about this. and this struggle it is for me writing in general isn't a strong suit due to my learning disablity but this isn't the time for excuses to not do somethign i want to do.
yes i know i can't spell yet i know people who can so asking for help once i get the book done will be 100% needed. and just becuase i asked for help don't mean i didn't do it. it just means i had help when needed.

hoping by the end of 2020 there will be a soild book about trails in southeast michigan downriver area. so many hidden gems in the local area. just got to make sure they are legal places to hike! lol

well with out further adew.. happy new year to you all.  stay blessed stay caring.. and remember be nice or leave!

trillium - nature study area.





trilliums lots of different types some protected some common. i remember when i seen my first one. at my dads looking at his land and walking threw the little patch of woods he has in back.  he received a lot of ditch dirt years back as he is building up his low areas of land. well a trillium must of been in there as i seen a wild one growing in the woods. i fell in love and watch for that flower every year. it's still comes up i think it's a bit over grown back there now.

i always hike too and if you hiked before in some spots you have these little fenced in areas that are nature studied to see the impact that deer have on the population. i never ever noticed much if any difference on those things until this year.




not sure how well you can see but if you look at the little white flowers those are trilliums. there are a few on the outside area. as i seen when i hiked. but wow the amount of those flowers in that area hands down is amazing.  such a difference so many of them. i wonder how good they taste to those deer and if they are edible to humans.


edit:
so i had to see if they are able to be digested by human. and native americans use the baby leaves that haven't opened into their foods i guess it taste like my favorite seed. sunflowers. yummy. might have to try this one day.  even tho you can't pick them in the wild i have my own land i just want a nibble a little.

there is also some medical reasons this was used for. from different parts of the plants from helping menstruation umm helps cramps to. awe this little gem is a sacred female herb.. cool.

drug abuse is it planned?





hello, it's been a long while for a post. so a quick catch up. life is crazy. it really is. i have lots of trips to post and share with the world but i'm so lazy that i'll never get around to it.
(have many round to its want one?) lol it's a wooden coin that says around to it. and it's quite the funny thing.

self discovery self love self awareness desires goals helping others helping self.  long journey i don't think it will ever end and i'm okay with that.

(am i the only one who spells okay with (ay) at the end?)

so i did have a surgery less than a week ago. (extra time, was spent sleeping, i'm at work silly) my niece said "i'm glad you lived" i about died laughing at that moment and it sort of hurt but was too freaking cute to have a 9 year old just be so bold and accepting of her self.  why do we humans grow out of that? does society condition us to the point we can't really be ourselves its like seen "wrong"  oh that's a different post for a different time. 

anyway i was looking at my paper work from the hospital and it says i'm suppose to get 10 pain pills  as i seen my signature for me to be aware of narcotic abuse.  (thought to my self at that time sweet they are lowering the amount of pills given out and making people sign to become aware of the problem)  i have known as i'm sure many people do knowing someone going threw a hard time and could be suffering from the narcotic pull. so i'm fully aware and honestly don't like the pills myself. i get their purpose i just don't think we need them for every boo boo. lets see if you catch this. i only used 1 of the 29 they gave me. .. did you see that?  it says on my paper work i'm to get 10 my pill container has 30 pain pills in them. umm should we have them sign a form too at the pharmacy's.  now in fairness i didn't check the strength maybe they didn't have strong ones so they gave me weaker ones. and doubled the amount. i guess i could see that.  either way. it is something to be aware of.

how many times has something like this happened to you?

if you wanna see my scars let me know they used surgical glue to "stitch" me up and its sort of cool!
