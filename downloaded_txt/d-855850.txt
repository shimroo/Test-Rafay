our history
a journey through time...
it is between history and modernity that the grand coeur latin hotel immerses you in a warm atmosphere. from your arrival, our walls welcome you and whisper their memories to you.
it all began in the 13th century with the construction of the abbey of cluny college here, where future priests came to stay and study the holy scriptures. inspired by illustrations, we have recreated this architectural arcade universe. a nod to this history that our guests can find in the various spaces of the hotel.
more recently, in 2022, the major renovation works of the grand coeur latin hotel revealed new surprises laden with an even more distant history. during six months of excavation under the current spa, archaeologists unearthed centuries by discovering columns, pottery, animal remains, and shells dating back to the roman empire just under their feet. one can then imagine the hustle and bustle of a crowd of merchants trading pottery, meat, and sea products transported by barges along the seine. thus, the spa was designed inspired by roman baths, offering our guests a soft and refined atmosphere where time seems to stand still.
