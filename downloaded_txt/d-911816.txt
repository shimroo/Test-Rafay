library circulation & reference assistance 	lakeland's library is a full partner in the teaching and learning process of the college community.	  	as the major information resource on campus, the library supports quality opportunities for lifelong learning by acquiring materials in support of the curriculum, providing access to those materials, and teaching information literacy skills. search the catalog, see library services, and stay up to date with our monthly newsletter.
	     
  	library hours 	to ensure you can take full advantage of our services and materials, please note our current operating hours. 	community borrowers	lakeland library is open to the public. apply in person for a lakeland library community borrower card with your valid state of ohio driver's license or state of ohio id. community borrowers may borrow up to 20 items at a time between lakeland library, ohiolink and searchohio  books, (limit of 5 ohiolink/searchohio transactions at a time) or interlibrary loan requests.  ohiolink databases and e-books are available to the public on campus only. the public is invited to attend library programs and participate in the library's book discussion groups, free of charge. the public will comply with all policies of lakeland library.
 	one-on-one research assistance	elevate your assignments, projects and papers with personalized guidance from lakeland's expert librarians. book a one-on-one consultation, available in-person or online, tailored to your needs. choose from 20, 30, or 40-minute sessions to suit your requirements. simply complete the request form here to get started.  	course reserves the library does not purchase textbooks to circulate, however, we have a few donations that do. normal loan periods apply. also, some instructors put textbooks and other supplemental materials into our course reserves, which can be used for periods of two hours at a time in the library. 	to find textbooks in the library, search the catalog by book title, author, or search the textbook reserve list. each textbook has an isbn number located on the back cover that is unique to that book. searching by isbn is probably the easiest way to locate a specific edition.  search for a textbook by author search for a textbook by title search for a textbook by isbn number 	you may search the course reserves list by course name or instructor name.

    one of my favorite things about lakeland is the ccp program, which is a great opportunity to earn college credit so that i'm able to save time and money in the future. it was great that i was able to earn two degrees while still in high school, so i can earn my bachelor's degree in 2 years.

    i loved coming to class to learn about real-life cases that my professors have experienced and the opportunity to go through mock crime scene scenarios. especially with the recent development of the criminal justice program, i enjoyed "investigating" a "residence", simulating a grave excavation, and lifting fingerprints. it is a bittersweet moment that i will be graduating.
