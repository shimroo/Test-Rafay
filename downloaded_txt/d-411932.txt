uxc's fabrication market outlook (fmo)


					with a long history of tracking the unique fabrication market, uxc issues an annual comprehensive and up-to-date fabrication market outlook (fmo) report addressing the commercial, economic, institutional, and technical aspects of this sector. fabrication differs greatly from other steps in the fuel cycle. its high technical content, need for regulatory approval, and the restriction of fuel assemblies to specific reactors require a unique approach to its analysis. to those with little knowledge of fuel fabrication and its markets, this report can serve as a primer providing a solid background and understanding of how its markets function. to those knowledgeable in the fundamentals, it offers analyses of a variety of its aspects based on several decades of participation. to those who are actively involved in the industry, it supplies additional insights to assist in the improvement of existing nuclear fuel programs and in the development of new ones.
				
					this year's in-depth topical essay in chapter 1 - essay: recent fabrication market highlights and trends five major trends now shaping the global fuel fabrication markets. this includes: fabricators upgrading plants and preparing for rising demand, the massive shifts underway in central and eastern europe's vver market, the latest push to deploy accident tolerant fuels (atfs), high burnup fuels (hbfs), and leu+ fuel, the potential for new fabrication plants to be built in certain markets, as well as ongoing preparations for haleu and related unique fuel designs for small, advanced, and micro reactors (samrs).
				
uxc's nuclear grade zirconium alloy market outlook



					uxc has prepared a new special report to provide an overview of the zirconium alloy market for the nuclear industry entitled nuclear grade zirconium alloy market outlook.  nuclear-grade zirconium alloys and products are used in the fabrication of fuel assemblies, which are used in the vast majority of nuclear reactor designs either currently operating, under construction, or planned around the world.  as the nuclear renaissance takes hold in countries all over the globe, many questions about the international nuclear supply chain have arisen. the supply of nuclear-grade zirconium - from zircon mineral sand through the cladding and components used in finished fuel assemblies - has also not escaped this scrutiny.  therefore, the primary objective of this report is to factually and analytically approach the current and expected future direction of the nuclear-grade zirconium market to help formulate clear conclusions about how producers of fuel assemblies for nuclear reactors will obtain the necessary zirconium for their finished products.
