      solutions  what types of twaron® do we offer?          

          twaron® filament yarn    twaron® filament yarn comes in a variety of mechanical properties, categorized simply as:standard modulus with high elongationhigh modulushigh tenacitytwaron® has proven its value across a wide range of applications, including optical fiber cables, hoses, tires, rubber goods, ballistic protection, protective clothing, ropes and cables, composites, and belts. our yarns, available in linear densities from 400 to 800 dtex, can be tailored to meet specific requirements.while twaron® typically comes in its natural yellow, we also offer black yarns for applications where appearance is key, such as composite fabrics, boat sails, and protective clothing.    twaron® staple fiber    twaron® staple fibers are ideal for making gloves and apparel that protect against heat and cuts. these fibers come in both the standard yellow para-aramid color and black. we offer several specific lengths (40, 50, 60 mm) and a range of cut lengths from 76 mm to 100 mm. choose from linear densities of 0.9, 1.7, and 2.5 dtex.for black fibers, options include 1.7 and 2.5 dtex densities. beyond staple fibers, twaron® is also available as stretch-broken yarns.    twaron® short-cut fiber    twaron® filament yarn can be processed into short-cut or dipped chopped fibers, ranging in length from 0.25 mm to 12 mm. these are ideal for use in engineering plastic applications, among others.    twaron® powder    twaron® is also offered in powder form, defined by particle size. this form is ideal for engineering plastics, coatings, and rubber compounds.    twaron® pulp    to create twaron® pulp, we cut the filament yarn, suspend it in water, and then fibrillate it. the pulp’s unique qualities, like fibril length and specific surface area, define its level of fibrillation. thanks to its chemical and physical properties, twaron® pulp increases stability and boosts the strength of the compounds it’s added to. we offer both dry and wet pulp in various fibril lengths and degrees of fibrillation, catering to a wide array of applications. these include friction products, sealing materials, and specialty papers, ensuring our customers have the best solutions at their disposal.
