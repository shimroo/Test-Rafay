oribe 2025 lunar new year setswelcome the year of the snake with these limited-edition gift sets. presented in custom-crafted boxes, these best-selling products are the perfect start to a new journey.























to mark the lunar new year, oribe has partnered with australian-chinese artist and textile designer chris chun, the custom packaging pays homage to the mystic knot, a favored ornament and craft dating back 1,000 years. tied from a single thread—much like a snake—the knot symbolizes endless luck, prosperity, and abundance.chun’s design brings this symbol to life with vibrant swirls of auspicious patterns and motifs, like lush peonies, chrysanthemums, and slinky snakeskin, while vivid hues of red represent happiness, beauty, vitality, and good fortune. this bold and mesmerizing art inspires recipients to welcome the new year with a deep sense of gratitude, joy, and great prosperity.
