 about us 
			












 twin creeks llamas is now 
					permanently closed 

after 18 wonderful years of hiking with 
					our llamas and meeting so many great people, we have made 
					the difficult decision to finally retire the llamas, 
					effective december 31, 2019. 
i have updated this website to be a 
					scrapbook of sorts, to provide information about llamas, and 
					hiking with llamas, and to reflect back on our years with 
					the llamas with some of our favorite photos and stories. 

if you have some time to kill, i invite 
					you to browse through this site and enjoy some of the 
					memories we have collected over the last two decades. 

a special thank you to all our 
					clients and friends
to all the wonderful people that we 
					have hiked with over the last 18 years, we want to thank you 
					for making this adventure one of the most rewarding 
					endeavors of our lives. we have made many friendships over 
					the years through our llamas that we will cherish for the 
					rest of our lives. 
					 
tim and i, too, are ready to retire. 
					tim has already retired from two careers, the first 
					retirement from the air force, and the second from the state 
					department. and now we are ready to retire from llama 
					trekking and have the freedom to finally do some traveling. 

over the years, we met so many 
					wonderful people, some of whom have become lifelong friends. 
					our llamas were first and always our pets, an integral part 
					of our family. it was one of the hardest things i have ever 
					done, when we drove our 4 remaining llamas on their last 
					road trip to their new home in charlottesville, va.  
we are so appreciative that our friend, 
					paige mcgrath of lower sherwood llamas, offered to adopt the 
					remaining 4 and give them a home through the rest of their 
					remaining years. paige is offering llama hikes on their 
					beautiful farmland just south of charlottesville. if any of 
					you are needing a llama fix, paige has a large flock of 
					beautiful llamas that are ready to take a walk with you. 
					santiago, coffee bean, prince and pete are also helping out 
					with the guided hikes. 
as hard as it was to say goodbye to 
					them, we felt happy that they had found such a warm and 
					loving place to spend their retirement. 
as for us, we sold the farm the middle 
					of may and found good homes for all of our animals. weâre 
					down to us and our 2 goldendoodles, bayley and amber. we 
					have moved to the coast of nc and weâll be building our 
					dream cottage in the town of southport.  
i am continuing with my etsy store, âtcllamasâ, 
					and featuring creations made from our llamasâ wool. i have 
					enough wool to keep me busy for a lifetime. and so the 
					llamas will always be with me. i will remember them with 
					love as i work with their fleece. please visit my shop at 
					https://www.etsy.com/shop/tcllamas 
though the llamas have been the 
					foundation of our business, it is you, the people, that have 
					been the heart of our business. you have made this âquirkyâ 
					adventure the most extraordinary, remarkable, and 
					unforgettable undertaking of our lives. 
					thank you all and âtake a hikeâ.   



i will still be making llama 
					crafts, and gifts from our llamasâ fiber on my etsy shop.
					

					www.etsy.com/shop/tcllamas. iâm always adding new 
					things that we make here in our shop, so please check with 
					us when you are looking for llama related gifts.

why hike with a llama?
llamas were domesticated 
			over 6000 years ago. the inca empire relied on llamas to transport 
			goods through the rugged andes mountains of south america. they are 
			especially well adapted to mountain hiking, having feet consisting 
			of 2 leathery pads, each with a curved toenail. this gives them 
			exceptionally good footing, while at the same time having very 
			little impact on the environment.
because llamas are calmer and also 
			smaller than horses or mules, they are not nearly as intimidating to 
			people with little experience handling large animals. they can even 
			be successfully led by young children.








			besides 
			being pleasant and amiable trail companions, the llamas can carry 
			all manner of things. if you are into camping, they can carry all 
			the tents, sleeping bags, and coolers. 

			if you are more into a day hike, the llamas can 
			carry the food and equipment needed for a delicious picnic lunch, 
			including tables and seats. 

			there are llamas that are working as caddies at golf resorts, and 
			llamas that help with trail maintenance in some national parks by 
			carrying tools such as saws and loppers. 

			hiking with llamas is a peaceful, rejuvenating experience. they are 
			our silent friends, making hardly any sound as they pad through the 
			forest. 

			even though twin creeks llamas is not offering hikes any longer, 
			the good news is the word is out that hiking with llamas is fun and 
			popular with people of all ages. there are lots more businesses 
			offering llama excursions than there were even 5 years ago. do an 
			internet search and find a llama adventure near you.
