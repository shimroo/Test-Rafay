the dillards bluegrass band








doug
and rodney are 
"the dillards"


 welcome
to the-dillards.com!!!



 
 july 2002: the
"darling boys" in new castle, in.





visit
weaver's
department store
- dillards music and all kinds of mayberry items.

when i think of the dillards,
one of the first things that pop to my mind is "the darling boys" from the andy griffith show.
i would expect that for those who are not fans of bluegrass music that
"the darling boys" would be the main reason you're looking at this
page.
 the dillards are much more than just the "darling" boys
but rodney, doug, dean and mitch will always be thankful to the
darling's for helping to spread their brand of entertainment to so many
generations.
