 welcome to the baea website 


who we are
the baea exists to raise the professional profile of educational audiologists and to provide a forum for communication between professionals.
what is an educational audiologist?
an educational audiologist (ed aud) usually is an experienced qualified teacher of deaf children and young people (qtod) or qualified clinical audiologist before they commence with the msc/pg diploma for educational audiology. an educational audiologist brings a combination of knowledge, skills, and experience that are unique within the field of deaf education (e.g., language development, speech discrimination, auditory processing skills development, speech and room acoustics, assistive listening devices (alds), radio aids, soundfield systems, hearing aids and auditory implants).
an ed aud brings an understanding of the way amplification, acoustics, ald and speech discrimination interplay in the speech, language and communication development and access to learning for a deaf baby, child or young person that no other professional can or does. an ed aud understands the relationships between listening to learn in various settings, cognition and expected levels of progress. an ed aud has skills, knowledge and experience of working routinely across the entire age range, currently from birth to 25 years, as per the code of practice.

baea membership - who can join?
the baea membership comprises mostly those educational audiologists working within education support services or schools for hearing-impaired children or young people. however other members come from a wide range of backgrounds and interest in paediatric audiology or hearing-impaired children and young people such as qualified teachers of the deaf, hospital paediatric audiologists, speech therapists, those working in auditory implant centres, and hearing aid manufacturers.

professional registration

    the first ever professional registration for educational audiologists was announced by the british association of educational audiologists (baea) in 2018. the voluntary registration is with uk's registration council for clinical physiologists (rccp) who enforce high standards of practice and maintain a public database of registrants for six disciplines.  further to the june 2018 press release,  final completion of the new educational audiology registration development process was completed in july 2019, following the professional standards authority (psa) accreditation renewal of rccp in early 2019. in may 2021, rccp announced it will become a subsidiary of the academy for health care science -  ahcs; with transition of business functions over the next 12 months and no immediate changes for registrants.

modules


educational audiology courses

early years training is available on the educational audiology courses as embedded as part of modules listed on the baea training page and also as a student-chosen focus option for each module's independent study and assignment.

bsa e-learning module

    bsa have hosted an e-learning module for the sake of raising awareness amongst audiology-related professionals of the role of educational audiology and its value.  it contributes significantly to joined-up audiology working between health and education which enables clinicians to more readily monitor 'real-life' functional benefit of hearing instrument (hi) fittings when patients are outside the clinic, providing more robust validation and potentially saving clinic time.  in turn this empowers clinicians' holistic partnership-working in terms of opening the auditory 'doorway to the brain' with impact on language, cognitive and social development contributing to literacy and well-being.

currently, the module is available to bsa members only.  however the first power point (no audio) is provided here.  further presentations with audio and supplemental material can be found in the bsa library/learning modules preview tab of bsa grow, which includes additional resources, or by clicking on the following links:

interprofessional education

stand-alone postgraduate modules in educational audiology are available for clinicians (or tods) for cpd; which align well with the british academy of audiology's higher training scheme for paediatric audiology. see training tab for information.
