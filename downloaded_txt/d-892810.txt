50 years of
access, work & rescue
carleton rescue equipment ltd. began its days as a division of carleton cycle & outdoor recreational equipment ltd. first established in 1937, we are a family business with deep roots in the outdoor retailing business.
the family and company’s spirit of innovation and its commitment to providing the highest quality of service, technical information, and proven products has made us a leader in the safety and rescue industry for over 85 years.
we are now known as ikamotsiipi carleton rescue. in the blackfoot language, ikamotsiipi means “rescue” or “bring to safety.”
as a proud indigenous business, we are now members of the canadian council for aboriginal business and acknowledge the ancestral lands and territories of the first-nation peoples in canada.
