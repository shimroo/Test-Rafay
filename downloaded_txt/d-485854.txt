    it’s breakfast meets lunch and vice versa when you dine at the country view restaurant. open most of the week from early morning to midafternoon, this greenland, new hampshire, eatery serves up both the first and second meals of the day, often blending components of each into its entrees.

    the two-level ember wood fired grill in downtown dover, new hampshire, is housed in a converted 19th-century fire station. downstairs, the ambiance is warm and relaxed, complete with a fireplace. upstairs the scene is more casual, with tvs, community seating, and a pool table.

    helen williams, owner and head chef of 2 home cooks, wants you to feel like family as soon as you enter her eatery. housed in dover’s cocheco park, the restaurant features a large wraparound bar that surrounds an open kitchen, giving customers a front-row view of the action, plus the ability to interact with the person making their meal. “we want to get to know the guests and be a little more personal,” williams says. “instead of walking into a restaurant, you’re walking into our home.”

    opened in december, 2016, the paddle inn in downtown newburyport operates with a “food, drink, sun, surf” theme—and it is working. “the response has been great,” says co-owner and executive chef suzi maitland, an experienced restaurateur with trina’s starlite lounge and parlor sports in somerville, massachusetts, among some of her other culinary business concerns.

    we would dine at the tiller restaurant just for the view. it’s stunning: crashing waves against granite cliffs and open ocean as far as the eye can see. this contemporary restaurant at the luxurious cliff house resort in cape neddick, maine, takes full advantage of its perch on rocky bald head cliff. gray-blue banquettes and wooden tables face a wall of windows overlooking the atlantic; a fieldstone fireplace warms a corner. the good news is that executive chef rick shell also takes full advantage of the location, working closely with local farms, dairies, ranchers, and fishermen and women to create equally stunning dishes, with deep ties to new england culinary traditions.
