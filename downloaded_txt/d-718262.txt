rimac services in detail

wellness visits
as your pet matures from a puppy/kitten to an adult onto a senior, we offer comprehensive wellness strategies that will enable you and your furry friend to plan for each life stage and the unique health needs associated with each stage. a vital part of the exam is the discussion between the client and the professional care giver at riamc.
the gradual onset of health problems in an apparently healthy pet often go unnoticed. depending on the communication between you and your doctor an informed decision of a yearly or bi-yearly exam can be determined. remember, your petâ€™s lifespan is shorter than ours. a lot can happen in 12 months.

diagnostics
laboratory testing plays an integral role in the early detection of changes in your petâ€™s health. diagnostic tests provide essential information by which our veterinarians can identify blood disorders, kidney and liver disease, diabetes, infection, cancer, thyroid disease and other hormonal problems.
rhode island animal medical center laboratory provides fast and accurate information so that your pet can receive appropriate treatment immediately after arriving at the hospital. when more sophisticated testing is required, we utilize a certified veterinary laboratory offering the expertise of board certified specialists in pathology, hematology, internal medicine and radiology. for your convenience we can also schedule in-house veterinary specialists in several different fields including internal medicine and cardiology.

dentistry
dental disease, specifically periodontal disease, is the most common ailment affecting pet dogs and cats. at riamc, we feel it is very important that our clients realize the impact dental care can have on their pets overall health.
an infection in your petâ€™s mouth is just like one in his or her kidney, heart, liver or lung. his body becomes stressed as it tries to chronically fight that infection. the infection can easily spread from the gums throughout the body via the bloodstream. dental infections are responsible for about 80% of heart valve disease which result in heart murmurs.
we offer ultrasonic teeth cleaning and digital dental radiographs that provides your pet with good oral health. as an adjunct to teeth cleaning, we recommend a dental home care plan that is specifically designed to your petâ€™s needs.

surgery
no procedure is routine when it comes to surgery at riamc. our team of doctors and surgical technicians provide an individualized anesthetic and pain management protocols for each pet undergoing surgery. for your petâ€™s safety, our operating suite is equipped with the latest in veterinary monitoring equipment including ekg, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, heart rate and respiration rate.
we are able to perform most surgical procedures from spays and neuters to more complicated abdominal surgeries, mass removals and some orthopedic (bone and joint) procedures. we take pride in our equipment and our modern anesthesia and patient monitoring systems.

pharmacy
rhode island animal medical center carries an extensive inventory of veterinary pharmaceutical items, supplies, and medications. for the convenience of our clients we have the ability to treat your sick companions right away. we do honor requests for scripts but do not deal directly with any online pharmacies.

prescription diets
the treatment of many conditions often requires the feeding of specialized veterinary diets. we carry a variety of hills science diet and purina prescription foods. if you need a special item please let our staff know and we try to accommodate.

daycare
if you have a puppy, high-energy breed or if you just donâ€™t like to leave your pet home alone all day, daycare offers many benefits:

exercise (most dogs donâ€™t get enough exercise which can lead to health and behavioral problems)
attention (many dogs get lonely and can engage in destructive behavior, such as chewing on furniture, etc.)
less stress (no rushing home to let your dog out or worries about working late)
reliability (our clean, safe and secure is open 7 days a week)
stay fit, have fun, and get clean â€“ add grooming and save $5

you can depend on our well-trained staff to give your pal plenty of tlc, as well as the opportunity to socialize with other dogs in a safe and secure environment. individual playtime, treats and group play are offered each day. dogs are supervised all day, whether outside in theÂ dog park or in our specially-designated indoor play area.
drop-off and pick-up times are as follows, but you can drop-off any time after start times and pick-up any time before end times:
monday to thursday: 7:30 am to 6:00 pmfriday: 7:30 am to 6:00 pmsaturday 8:00 am to 5:00 pmsunday 9:00 am to 4:00 pm
all dogs must be fully vaccinated and checked for proper disposition and like size. please call (401) 785-1000 to schedule an appointment.
we welcome personal visits so you can see the way in which we provide a happy and healthy stay for each guest.

boarding
creating a safe and comfortable stay for your pet is our highest priority.
our highly trained and experienced staff, and our clean, secure, and climate controlled facility produce a stable environment that you can depend on, regardless of the length of your petâ€™s stay.
we offer a variety of accommodation and budget options, with clean bedding provided on-site.
