initiative onharmonisation within atmospheric dispersion modelling for regulatory purposes
in 1991, a european initiative was launched for increased cooperation and standardisation of
                atmospheric dispersion models for regulatory purposes.
                a "new generation" of models was emerging and the parametrisations of dispersion processes are even now
                continuously improving. a need was felt for
                models to be developed in a well-organized manner and turned into practical, generally accepted tools
                fit for the various needs of decision-makers. on this
                background it was decided to organize a series of workshops to promote the use of new-generation models
                within atmospheric dispersion modelling, and in in
                general to improve the "modelling culture". the subsequent activities have now been going on for more
                than 30 years, and have developed to a series of successful international conferences.
a historical overview of the “harmo initiative” was presented by helge
                  olesen, former chairman, at the 18th harmo conference: twenty-five years of harmonisation conferences – looking back and ahead

past conferences and workshops
a series of international conferences started after the first four workshops, becoming a recognised
                  meeting place for model developers, model users and stakeholders. since year 2000 the proceedings,
                  consisting of 5-pages extended abstracts, are freely available on-line, subject to authors’
                  permission. proceedings, presentations and posters from the participants are available under the
                  webpage of the relative conference listed below. 
                  proceedings can be found also through a google scholar search and are indexed in scopus. ever since 1994 full-length versions of
                  selected papers from the conferences have been published in special issues of the international journal on
                  environment and pollution (ijep) until harmo19, and in air quality, atmosphere and health (airq) starting from the harmo20 conference.
