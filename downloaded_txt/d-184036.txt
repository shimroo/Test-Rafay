paul mccartney talks elvis: elvis was one of the biggest influences for the beatles and like the rest of the fab four, paul mccartney was captivated by the sound and style of the king of rock and roll. paul took inspiration from elvis throughout his career, with the connection remaining deeply personal.
                        in a recent interview paul mccartney revealed three songs which have stood out as his elvis favourites. 
1956's 'heartbreak hotel' established elvis as a star and launched him into new heights of fame. paul described the song as "electrifying".
âyou heard on the radio elvis presleyâs 'heartbreak hotel'. it was like, âoh my god, what is that?â- they weren't playing much of elvis' stuff on the radio in those days. to hear 'heartbreak hotel' i had to go into a record shop in liverpool and listen to it through headphones in one of those booths. it was a magical moment, the beginning of an era. listening to it that first time was the start of my elvis experience.
                        of course, it's an amazing song. lyrically, for starters, it was a real shock. elvis is a truly great vocalist, and you can hear why on this song. his phrasing, his use of echo, it's all so beautiful. it's the way he sings it, too. as if he's singing it from the depths of hell. it's a perfect example of a singer being in command of the song. musically it's perfect, too. the double-bass and the walk-in piano create this incredibly haunting atmosphere. it's so full of mystery, and it's never lost that for me. the echo is just stunning. 
                        now that we know it so well, you think, âoh, itâs elvis singing heartbreak hotel.â 





another elvis song thought of fondly by mccartney is 'all shook up' to rolling stone he recounted how the song once helped him shake off a headache in his teenage years. "i remember once, a friend of mine from liverpool, we were teenagers, and we were going to a fairground. this girl was so beautiful. everyone was following her â it was like a magical scene. i soon found myself with a pounding headache so i put on the elvis song 'all shook up' it was so powerful that by the end of the song the headache had gone.
                          another is 'i want you, i need you, i love you' revealing that the song reduced him to tears when he listened to it as an adult. âi suddenly realised the last time i listened to this thoroughly was before the beatles, before all that happened to me, and it just stripped it all away. it actually got me crying, wow. really did it to me.
                          it was like i was a kid playing snooker again and listening, with elvis singing, "hold me close, hold me tight....â

'viva las vegas' import vinyl: from the popcorn label a double album dedicated to the viva las vegas sessions. most of the sessions took place from july 9 through july 11 of 1963 at the radio recorders studio's studio b, located in hollywood, california. elvis briefly went back to the studio on the 8th and 30th of august to record santa lucia and whatâd i say. some overdubs & scoring sessions took place at the mgm soundstage in august & october 1963.
                        the sessions resulted in 12 master recordings besides some alternate movie versions. the movie premiered on may 20th, 1963, throughout the usa. however, there was never a soundtrack lp released for viva las vegas as was the custom at the time, although there was an extended play which flopped. the popularity of extended plays had been declining ever since elvis last put out an ep. along with the extended play, a 45 rpm was also released with the title song of the movie and ray charlesâ âwhatâd i say.â.
                        now you can enjoy highlights from these recording sessions on this deluxe double album.

(book review) 'elvis uk compact volume 1 - the ultimate guide to elvis presley's british cds 1983-2005' (john townson & gordon minto): in 2021, the elvis uk dynamic duo released the voluminous 1,400 page 'elvis uk 3 the ultimate guide to elvis presley's british cds 1983-2005 in digital "flipbook" format. 
                          in 2025, we have the first of three "physical" volumes presenting the contents of the "flipbook". 
 'elvis uk3' is an outstanding reference e-book, there is however a keen section of elvis collectors who prefer to own physical books as opposed to digital versions. 
                          while the original 1,400 page book was too large to print as a single volume, the authorâs idea of splitting it into three volumes is a very clever idea.
                          leafing through these 478 printed pages of 'compact volume 1' gave us another reason to dig deep into elvisâ cd legacy and enjoying the fascination of some stunning elvis releases.
 go here as ein's nigel patterson explores this information-packed glorious new printed book.

'the australian women's weekly icons 28': elvis is a regular front-cover star in 'australian women's weekly icons' publications.
in their 28th 'icons' edition, the first for 2025, they revisit more tales, triumphs and tragedies from hollywoodâs golden age. from the secrets of walt disney's studios, elvis' early sixties relationship with swedish-american actress ann-margret to lauren bacallâs original interview and much more thereâs plenty to explore in this 164-page issue.
"twin flames" it was an affair that set the world on fire â and almost ended his marriage to priscilla in the process. sarah rodrigues revisits the story of the woman who many felt should have become queen to elvisâ king.
at the age of 28, elvis presley was already an old hand at movie-making â heâd notched up 13 films, as well as countless hit singles. but his 14th film â 1964âs viva las vegas â was the one that was going to have a significant and lasting impact on his personal life. in a meeting engineered by mgm studio executives to ensure that there would be enough âchemistryâ between the king of rockânâroll and his leading lady, the swedish-american actress ann-margret olsson, the pair came face to face for the first time on an otherwise empty soundstage....

elton john talks elvis: this week on cbs' the late show with stephen colbert, elton john appeared and in the later part of his interview talked about meeting elvis...â 
at the end of the interview stephen colbert tried out his 'q&a' game to discover some interesting alternate facts about elton john.â 
the first few were basic questions, favorite sandwich, the first concert he attended etc before more intruiging ones including whether elton had ever asked someone for an autograph, to which elton  replied affirmatively and that it was elvis!
colbert teased, "now hold on a second here, did you get it?
elton john, "yep"
colbert, "more importantly, do you still have it?"





elton john, "yep!" and then explained, "it's on a tour program. i went to go see him in washington, d.c., so i have his autograph."
colbert, "does it say 'to elton....?"
elton john, "no. he was not well at the time, and he was very shaky signing....
i was just so incredibly impressed to be in the same room as him, so i value it very much."

in previous interviews elton john has also spoken about the effect elvis had on his life..
"elvis presley changed everyone's life. without him there'd be no
 




beatles, there'd be no hendrix, there'd be no dylan, he was the man that changed music - without question. elvis was the most influential musician in rock'n'roll, without him groups would never have picked up guitars. i know he drew his influences from gospel and blues, country music and black soul music whatever, but he was the king and he was the one that started it all.
when i first saw him i was a little boy in a barber shop in pinner green (a suburb of outer london) and i looked at an old life magazine and there was a picture of him and i thought he was from mars or something. and then that weekend my mum came home with his single 'heartbreak hotel' and that changed my life - i'd never heard anything like that before in my whole life.
it completely changed the way i listened to music forever. it was just so primal.. i'd never been around music like that, music that was so powerful. i'd certainly never heard an electric guitar played like that. the echo on the record! wow!â 

when i put the two together it was astonishing. elvis looked amazing and sounded amazing and it changed everything for me. it was rock'n'roll! it was what i wanted to be.

i saw him in las vegas and he was fantastic at the hilton but the only time i ever met him was very briefly before he went on stage in washington dc the year before he died and it was very sad. but even though it was very sad, even though he only went through the motions and he was not really there at that concert, in the end there was still flashes of brilliance. he was hugely overweight but emotionally when he sung a couple of lines he was still magical - and you don't lose that magic no matter how f**ked up you are. if you're brilliant, snatches of that brilliance will still come through.
what happened to him - and you forget that he died very early, he was only 42 for-christ's-sake, only 42 - it is one of the great tragedies. he was surrounded by a manager who just closeted him and ripped him off and he never had enough people around to help him, i don't think anybody was there to say to him, "hey elvis, you can't do that, you mustn't do that."




 
  in her recent memoir, lisa marie talked about meeting elton john....
                          ... aunt delta knew how much i loved elton john. one christmas she got me some of his records. my dad watched me open the gift, said "that's nice," and went off through the swinging doors that led from the dining room into the kitchen. i found out later that in the kitchen he said to aunt delta, "why did you get her those records? who the hell is this son-of-a-bitch that she's wanting to hear?"
"she likes him," said delta.
    soon after, before one of his shows, my dad met elton backstage. he needed to meet this person whose records i was listening to. elton and i have giggled about it ever since...
    i finally met elton a year later, for my ninth birthday. my mother arranged for me to go to his house. he showed me his clothes, his closet, his boots. he was very sweet. we had tea."

(new book) 'elvis october 1958 vol. 1' (paul belard): hot on the heels of his book about marion keisker, prolific author, paul belard, has also released the latest softcover in his "visual biography" series chronicling elvis' life story.
                          the book is large sized (21.86 x 28 cm) and contains 224 pages. there are some color photos but most of the images are in b&w.
                          the book description on "amazon":
"after nine days at sea, the uss randall docked at bremerhaven, in germany, on october 1st, 1958. hordes of fans and reporters waited for its most famous passenger, elvis presley. 
  if he thought his popularity had waned since he was drafted, there is no doubt that this welcome must have been comforted him. once on land, elvis took the train to friedberg, then reported to ray kaserne (ray barracks) where he would spend the rest of his military service.
"this day was somewhat similar to his induction day in memphis in march. according to some accounts, 170 reporters and photographers were on duty, following elvis during his first two days in germany."
    paul b. has advised that the second volume of elvis in october 1958 will be published soon as will another book, elvis november 1958.
                          paul's books can be found on amazon or for a signed edition he can contacted by email: pbelard@hotmail.com

note the only photo featured is the front cover.
"a live concert to me is exciting because of all the electrical generated in the crowd and on stage. it's my favourite part of the business" -elvis presley - september 4th 1972.
during the formative years of my 'elvis is king' fan club (founded in 1974), fans were traveling across the usa, following elvis on tour, or attending elvis' las vegas engagements and lake tahoe appearances.
they would lovingly and dedicatedly send reports, reviews and accounts of seeing elvis on stage, at hotels, in airports or in transport "as it happened".â 
these thrilling times, linking us to elvis in a unique way, were typed up and mailed to me to be shared with members within the pages of my monthly magazine newsletter.
in celebration of my 2024 fan club's 50th anniversary these incredible memories - cherished within the archives are shared here collectively for the first time in over five decades.
- they are for those old enough to remember the "glory days".â 
- they are here for the new fans discovering elvis.
- they are here for the generations yet to come, who will find elvis long after we all have left the world behind.â 





  - so "sit back and leave the driving to us" as elvis would often say.
  take a deep breath as the lights dim, the orchestra begins, and from the wings of the hilton, and the waiting areas of the hallways, elvis comes back to you one last time.â

ftd's 2012 release of a previously unheard soundboard 'another saturday night'â   from shreveport june 7, 1975 was the real delight.
disappointingly all the performances on this new ftd set have been out on bootleg before.
ein previously reviewed this tour's concerts as, "this mid-1975 period was a positive return for elvis and found him looking and sounding healthy and happy. being a popular period perhaps the set-list is a little familiar and ftd collectors will no doubt have heard a few similar 1975 shows before. however elvisâ good mood throughout is truly infectious and along with his well-sung and committed performances they





all go to making these concerts worth listening to."
previous bootleg releases of these shows all in good sound quality..

'marion keisker: the woman who first recorded elvis presley' new book: paul belard's latest book has been released. the 310-page softcover is a detailed account of marion keisker's life and key role in the elvis story.
"that woman was the one who had faith she was the one that pushed me... marion did it for me" - elvis presley
at the jaycee ceremony in january 1971, honoring elvis presley as one of the 'ten outstanding young men of the nation', elvis saw marion keisker in the audience. as he approached with priscilla, he said, "this is the woman i've been telling you about. she's the one who made all this possible. without her, i wouldn't be here today."
marion was sam phillips' assistant when he established the memphis recording service, and later sun records.
she is best remembered as the first person to record elvis in july 1953, then encouraging sam phillips (numerous times) to record him "commercially", therefore playing a pivotal role in elvis' ascent towards the pinnacle of his career.
throughout interviews given, marion discloses the workings of sun records, the sessions, elvis' moods during those first days of his career. there is a trove of little known or unknown anecdotes many fans will delight in. 
this book is a fitting and well-deserved tribute to marion keisker.'
 ein notes that this  is an important and great read!
a release focusing on marion keisker is long overdue and paul belard's great detective work has uncovered many rare photos and archival material.





another book (largely) about ms keisker, by the late darrin memmer, was due to be published in 2022, but didn't happen due to darrin's sad passing.

  news from earlier last week ... 





actress jan shepard has died: jan shepard, who co-stared in both âking creoleâ, 'paradise, hawaiian style' along with multiple tv shows such as rawhide and the virginian has died aged 96.
shepard died of pneumonia january 17 at st. joseph medical center, burbank.â 
shepard portrayed mimi, the sister of danny fisher, in king creole, as well as the wife of elvis' business partner danny kohana (james shigeta) in paradise, hawaiian style.
in interviews shepard recalled, âthe first time, i found elvis to be just the cutest kid around, a big teddy bear, a lot of fun that was before the army. but by paradise, hawaiian style heâd come back from the service and he had changed. he had a lot of bodyguards around him. on king creole we got along so great because we worked alone the two of us the whole first week of the shoot. he was a brilliant actor because he didn't need any advice, he automatically knew what to do. i came to work one day and i found a pair of earrings he put there for me that cost about ten cents - that he had liberated from the set. i have a marvelous picture where we are waiting to perform and we were just sitting down at the dining room table. i joked with him that he was "the last of the big spenders". it made him laugh so hard and they snapped this picture of the two of us. it's a fabulous picture of him, my favourite. elvis would play music on his guitar and he would ask me what i wanted to hear. elvis loved 'danny boy'.
by 1965 elvis was tired of it all, it as always the same movie, he hated it."






in a later interview with joe krein shepardâ  pointedly noted, "all col parker wanted was the money and he was stealing money from elvis and so was rca. i mean, they were just elvis. he was getting 50% of elvis and he didn't want to do anything that would take him to japan. elvis wanted to go to japan. they adored him overseas. colonel parker always said no.
you know, i think that when his mom died, that was just a terrible blow and that if she had lived elvis would still be alive today."
born josephine angela sorbello in quakertown, pennsylvania, jan shepard moved to los angeles in 1949 and joined a theater group and then trained at the pasadena playhouse.
shepard made her onscreen debut on a 1952 episode of fireside theater and was soon being booked on shows including  waterfront, public defender and the loretta young show.
in 1954 shepard appeared in her first tv western and that followed with the lone ranger, rawhide, gunsmoke, the virginian and the high chaparral.
it was her friendâ  dolores hart who got her the role in king creole by recommending her to hal wallis.

jocathy brownlee, elvis girlfriend has died: jocathy brownlee elkington, well-loved part of the elvis community, sadly died last friday jan 24. she dated elvis from august 1975 for several months after they met at a world football league game in memphis on  august 2, 1975. she was working part-time  as a hostess in the press box for the memphis southmen grizzlies. the night they met elvis was with linda thompson but she knew linda  as they had both attended memphis state university. the following week her friend barbara klein called to tell me that elvis wanted to give me $100 for being so nice to him in the press box - and that elvis wanted her phone number so that he could call and ask her out!
  jocathy explains, "sure enough, elvis called me, asked me if i would like to come to graceland, meet lisa and then go to the crosstown theatre and watch movies. that was our first date, and, after we left the theatre, we went back to graceland. once we returned, he surprised me with a brand new pontiac grand prix. he said to me, âhoney, i hope this oneâs okâ¦ it was the best i could do at 4 oâclock in the morning!â
we dated on and off  until the end of october 1975 and the only time that we were apart was right after he had to cut his las vegas summer season short in late august and was admitted to baptist hospital in memphis. once he was released from the hospital, we were together until the end of october.
elvis was such a generous person. if he werenât giving me a car, jewelry, money to buy clothes etc., he would give me things





that belonged to him. between elvisâ bedroom and bathroom there was a little closet where he kept various books, albums, items that were sent to him by fans etc. elvis walked into the little closet one evening when we were having a discussion about religion and brought out an album of his along with his praying hands and several other items. 
i asked him if he ever listened to his own records, and he told me that he rarely did!"
jocathy brownlee was a well-loved part of the elvis community and will be truly missed.

ein exclusives and news from earlier in  january ... 





 baz luhrmann explains more about his new elvis documentary: with heightened interest about luhrmann's future elvis documentary the director revealed some secrets from outside graceland and us deadline also asked him some questions...
luhrmann was back at graceland telling all, "i am thrilled to be back in graceland and to be able to say that it's true, it is very very true..â  i can't even begin to tell you what we have found during the making of 'elvis', in terms of never before seen concert footage.. and our sleeves are rolled up, we're working hard and we want to make something absolutely unprecedented and special with this material. so it's time, as we like to say, to tcb."
  luhrmann also explained to deadline, âthere has always been talk amongst elvisâ fans, both longtime fans and newer fans brought in by our film elvis, of missing reels and never-before-seen concert footage.
"during the making of elvis, from very early on in my process i had the privilege to access the studioâs vaults deep in the salt mines of kansas, where troves of old film negatives are stored. we were astonished by the sheer volume of unused footage from elvis: thatâs the way it is, the film of elvisâ legendary 1970 summer festival in las vegas, all shot on anamorphic 35mm, and also from elvisâs road concert film from two years later, 'elvis on tour'.





 âequally exciting was that we found not only material that has never been seen in this quality but also rare behind-the-scenes audio that had been feared lost, especially some fascinating recordings of elvis telling stories from his own life in his own words.â
âweâre still very much in the middle of creating this work, but there has been so much talk and such enthusiasm for this





  that i felt now it was time to share what has been happening with it. i canât say much more about it, except that i wouldnât call it a documentary, or a concert film; our aim here is to make something new in the elvis canon.
my creative team at bazmark is being led by my longtime editor, jonathan redmond, and weâve partnered with the terrific teams at authentic studios and sony music vision, with great support from warner bros., to bring something to the screen that befits the magnitude of elvis as a performer but also offers deeper revelations of his humanity and inner life.â
'bazmark' / authentic studios are producing the documentary.
the film will be distributed by sony music vision, in partnership with sony legacy recordings.

david lynch director and elvis fan dead at 78: director-writer david lynch who radicalised american film with a dark, surrealistic artistic vision in films like 'blue velvet', 'mulholland drive', 'twin peaks' and 'wild at heart' died 15 january 2025, he was 78.
lynch had an immaculate sense of how to use well-known songs in his movies. he was a master manipulator constantly deploying major hits into unexpected corners of his films, recontextualizing classics by everyone from elvis presley to blue velvet's roy orbison. whether he was borrowing from the pop world or creating something of his own, his approach to music resulted in moments that were sometimes spine-chilling and always surprising.
lynch stated, âiâve loved music always, and my music fire was lit by elvis presley, really, and all that was happening back then.â





david lynch was a true elvis fan, his movie 'wild at heart' which featured nicolas cage doing his best elvis impersonation as sailor ripley on the run with laura dern's lula fortune. nicolas cage would of course later go on to marry lisa marie!  in the film nicolas cage would sing a stunning rendition of elvis' "love me".




later in the movie cage then sings 'love me tender' to lula.
during rehearsals lynch discussed elvis and marilyn monroe with cage and dern. he also bought a copy of elvis' golden records and suggested to cage that he should sing two songs, 'love me' and 'love me tender'. cage recorded them himself so that he could lip-synch to them on the set. cage asked lynch if he could wear a snakeskin jacket in the film and lynch incorporated it into his script.
in an interview with spin magazine lynch explained..
... hearing rockabilly music as a kid was like being hit with a truck filled with happiness. so many musicians when they saw elvis for the first time, they just slammed their head with their fist and just sad, âdamn! this is it!â and it was just suddenly so obvious. it wasnât there, and then it was there. and it had this unbelievable power, and it just screamed out. it was unbelievably beautiful. i just felt this thrill, this love of the sound. it was like grabbing onto an electric wire.
- fifties music held a happiness for sure, but you know elvis also sings 'heartbreak hotel' and thereâs a kind of sweet sadness, and that dream thing that could go either way. the â50s dream, like the fleetwoods 'come softly to me' was real popular. and all the great ones there, they caught this thing. in every decade the music paints the mood. so if you listen to what was popular in the â50s, from â56 on, maybe, and itâs a summer night and youâre listening to this or youâre slow-dancing in a basement with a girl, you can go back to that time.

 'elvis last tours vol.2' in-depth ftd review: ftd's 3-cd 5âdigipak 'elvis: the last tours volume 2' features recordings from six elvis performances in march 1977, norman ok march 25 & 26 , abilene tx march 27, austin tx march 28 and alexandria la march 29 & 30.

      elvis was not in good health, had been rowing with girlfriend ginger alden and the last four dates of this second tour of 1977 had to be cancelled. 
      so one has to ask how much do you enjoy elvisâ performances in 1977? five of these soundboards have never been released before and it is elvisâ abilene concert that is the real highlight.
      of course, if you are a collector who appreciates elvis in 1977 then this set might be perfect for your collection.
elvis soundboard super-collector geoffrey mcdonnell along with ein's piers beagley explore this new six concert pack in-depth to see what fans might discover..

elvis 90th birthday success on us charts: forbes reports, just in time for elvis' birthday, that elvis' success on the us charts is more than just rock'n'roll.
elvis presley is widely regarded as one of the most successful rock musicians of all time.â while he didnât invent the genre, he is still seen as one of its pioneers to this day, as he helped popularize it in america, and then the rest of the world.
the late superstar is often found on billboardâs rock charts, if anywhere. he can sometimes make space on some general lists as well,  especially around the holidays when his catalog surges.â 
thatâs the case this first week of january 2025, though his name also appears on tallies dedicated to several other styles as well.
presley claims a hit album on five different charts that focus only on one genre. 
not bad for someone who is 90 years old this very week!â 
elvis' current success underlines not only the starâs continued popularity across america, but also how his work can be classified under different labels- including both work he released during his lifetime and afterward.
of course, presley performs best on the rock rosters.â 





'the classic christmas album' reaches no. 1 for the first time on the top rock albums list this week, earning him another posthumous chart-topper.â 
he nearly repeats that success on the top rock & alternative albums chart, where the holiday collection returns to its all-time high of no. 2.
on the top country albums chart the classic christmas album is also a new peak of no. 4.
presley might not rise as high on the top country albums list as he does on the rock rankings, but he earns twice as many appearances with the essential elvis presley up from no 41 to no. 37 on the same tally giving him a pair of simultaneous top 40 titles.
elvis: ultimate gospel reappears on the top christian albums chart this week at no. 43.

spotlight "elvis presley: sun's newest star": printed in the us 'cowboy songs' june 1955 issue this was the first national magazine article about elvis.â

mrs camden ‘made in germany – private recordings’ review: from the budget mrs camden label this cd features personal recordings 
taken from a recently discovered tape made by elvis while stationed with
 the us army in germany in january 1959. 
what is so fascinating about this period is that, although the colonel stopped elvis recording anything professionally in germany, elvis was still bursting with music.  elvis was jamming at home on multiple songs that he would later record professionally for rca. these original jams on songs such as âhis hand in mineâ, âlike a babyâ, âi'll take you home again kathleenâ, âi will be trueâ, âdanny boyâ, âthe foolâ even an attempt at âare you lonesome tonightâ plus âthereâs no tomorrowâ  are totally enthralling.
historians always talk about elvis vast knowledge of every musical genre and here is proof of his influences.
a lot of fans, including myself, would truly appreciate a âbest ofâ these home-recordings and just in time for christmas 2024 the budget label âmrs camdenâ have done exactly that.

'the mono to stereo interview with anthony stuchbury': the new stereo elvis box-set 'presley the essential '50's masters' from producer anthony stuchbury will be released by the french rdm label next week.
                          the question of whether elvis' mono fifties classic recordings should be re-released in "new stereo" is hotly debated among hard-core collectors and this box-set includes all of elvis' 50's mono masters in stereo!
so this week is the perfect time to talk to the man behind the mixing desk, for the backstory behind this recent development of mixing elvisâ original mono recordings into stereo.

'from elvis at christmas' mrs 'stereo' album review: the cover of elvis' original 1957 christmas album was truly disappointing as it always looked like rca wanted to keep elvisâ image as small as possible. elvisâ 1971 christmas album was an even worse design. 
for their new album 'from elvis at christmas' the mrs label have finally created a cover worthy of elvis - and it is a stunner.
elvis albums are all about the tactile feel  and this vinyl features a super-impressive snow-glitter colour. it even sparkles as it spins... 
and the real treat here is that mrs present elvisâ christmas album in gorgeous stereo - and âboy mah-boyâ does it sound superb.
from the very first seconds of âsanta claus is back in townâ when the jordanaires sing âchristmas, christmasâ on the right channel, dudley brooks piano kicks in left and then dj fontanaâs drums burst on the centre channel with elvis singing, âwellllllll, itâs christmas time pretty baby and the snow is falling on the ground...â you know this is going to be a sensational ride.

                          reviews have been glowing since day one, the latest including a four-page text and image overview in itâs elvis time magazine (netherlands) and a detailed review in the cult rock & roll magazine, ugly things (based in california).

 'elvis last tours vol.1' in-depth ftd review: ftd's 4-cd 5âdigipak 'elvis: the last tours volume 1'  features recordings from seven elvis performances in february 1977, west palm beach (feb 13), st. petersburg (feb 14), montgomery (feb 16), columbia (18), johnson city (19) and charlotte (20/21).
      by 1977 elvis was running on low, his set-list had become stagnant and 
 fans were lucky to hear elvis perform any rare song in 
his predictable set-list.

elvis did not look healthy at the start of this tour but his weight and voice definitely improved as the tour progressed.
so one has to ask how much do you enjoy elvisâ performances in 1977?  
there were certainly a few highlights but overall most of these concerts sound all too similar.
of course if you are a collector who appreciates elvis in 1977 then this set might be perfect for your collection.
elvis soundboard super-collector geoffrey mcdonnell along with ein's piers beagley explore this new seven concert pack in-depth to see what fans might discover..

'elvis uk â compact vol.1 'the ultimate guide to british cd releases 1983-2005' book out now: 
volume 1 of the three-volume, soft-backed set 'ultimate guide to elvis presleyâs british cd releases' (each volume published in turn over a period of several months â thus spreading the cost) is out now. priced at â£50 per book (which includes p&p costs for uk buyers) directly available from www.elvisukbooks.
 apart from minor changes to the layout, the print copy editions will contain exactly the same content as the downloadable, digital flip book version (entitled 'elvis uk3 the ultimate guide to elvis presleyâs british cd releases 1983-2005'), first issued in early 2021. â 
        this trilogy of books represents the first major attempt by anyone to chronicle in exhaustive and painstaking detail the rise of elvisâs compact disc releases from 1983 onwards â cross-referenced where appropriate with vinyl versions. and while particularly focused on the uk, there is a huge amount of overlap with other territories which makes it of major interest to elvis collectors throughout the world. â 
uk books say that those who want a copy in time for christmas really should order quickly. this is likely to be a limited press run. â 
the second and third volumes will be available in the early part of 2025, though released separately to ease the cost burden for collectors. 

ein is delighted that this massive volume  is now being published as a 3-volume physical book.

(review) 'vintage rock presents - elvis: the ultimate album guide': the 2024 âvintage rock presents elvisâ is 130 pages examining his album catalogue â from studio, soundtracks and live concerts to compilations, 7â eps and remixes.
                          each album is introduced by a generously sized image of its cover followed by thoughtful analysis of the record's content, and its context in the elvis presley story. there is also a coloured rectangular box neatly detailing key release information and track listing.
                          fans will no doubt be impressed with the breadth of the thoughtful views expressed by each contributor and there is plenty in the magazine to stimulate debate.
                          it is  unfortunate that well-written periodicals aren't afforded the same level of attention to detail as some other elvis publications.
                          einâs nigel patterson spent a rainy afternoon reliving what elvisâ eclectic album catalogue offered, the good, the bad, and the mediocre.

'from here to the great unknownâ book review: after all the publicity and hype lisa marie's revealing memoir has recently been published. there is no doubt that being part of a famous family certainly does not guarantee a happy life.
as keough explains, âthe early parts of the book are mostly my mother's voice, in the tapes she speaks at length about her graceland childhood, the death of her father, the dreadful aftermath, her relationship with her mother, her difficult teen years. sheâs frank and funny about my father, danny keough. she talks openly about her relationship with michael jackson. sheâs painfully candid about  later drug addiction and the perils of fameâ¦
if you have ever wondered how lisa marie coped with life post-elvis or noticed those old tabloid news reports saying that she had once again âgone off the railsâ or spotted the tension between her and priscilla,  the answers and much, much, more are in this stunning memoir...
while elvis died when lisa marie was only 9 years old there is still plenty new to discover from this intriguing book..

 âgolden elvis!' mono ii stereo cd review:  in the fifties when scotty, bill and d.j were in rca studios with elvis they were of course playing in âstereoâ. it was rcaâs engineers who mixed the multiple microphone feeds down to mono.
in this 4-year period elvis changed the very world we live in with his unprecedented success and  it was his almighty rca 45 rpms that rocked the world.
'elvisâ first two golden records lps encapsulated this stunning creativity and the two albums are neatly combined here in anthony stuchburyâs new rdm release âgolden elvis!â mono to stereo. 
and it is a sensational compilation.
from the almighty blast of âhound dogâ, via âjailhouse rockâ, âtoo muchâ, i need your love tonightâ, through to âdonchaâ think itâs timeâ elvis in the fifties doesnât get much better.
 ein's piers beagley turns the "hifi high and the lights down low" for this in-depth review
                        (cd reviews, source;elvisinformationnetwork) 





note: in a neat coincidence, the above golden records! mono > stereo review was completed before yesterday's announcement from ernst jorgensen that rca were also looking into releasing elvis' mono recordings in stereo sometime in the future! (see story below)â  





stereo sun-sessions from sony/rca?; rolling stone this week featured an interview with rca's ernst jorgensen who confirmed that they were looking at releasing elvis' mono recordings in stereo using ai digitally extracted stereo.
ein has been suggesting this for years often to be slammed by the 'old-school' who said it would never be done officially!
in the interview jorgensen confirmed..
.. jorgensen recently asked emile de la rey, who worked on the sound for peter jacksonâs get back documentary, to do a test remix of âgood rockinâ tonightâ using jacksonâs proprietary ai technology. the results, âa perfect separation of instrumentsâ along with the removal of tape hiss, were far superior to any more widely available  methods, so jorgensen is waiting for access to that level of technology. 
once heâs got it ernst says, âiâd like to do everything from the fifties. because even the sun recordings, 





they are very simple. thereâs an acoustic and electric and a slap bass. but when you open that up, itâs still like a new revelation. itâs not like it becomes thin and you think, âoh, is that all there is?'â
jorgensen has been in charge of presley reissues from the groundbreaking 1992 collection 'the complete 50s masters' to the just-released box set memphis. and when the technologyâs ready, jorgensen is hoping for an ambitious, ai-fueled reworking of presleyâs 1950s masterpieces, starting with his epochal recordings at sun studios between 1954 and 1956.

book review - 'elvis uk 78 rpm': recently published soft-cover 'elvis 78 r.p.m. the ultimate guide to elvis presley's british 78s 1956 - 1960' by john townson and gordon minto is their  latest forensic look into elvis' uk releases, this time 228 
pages dedicated to elvis 78rpms, along with plenty of bonus chapters.
â â78sâ were the dominant record type for more than 50 years before disappearing circa 1960. 
today, they hold special significance for many who grew up with them. given 78s were in their last few years of mass production when elvis arrived on the scene, his 78s are much sought after by collectors and largely forgotten by the general fan.
'elvis 78 rpms'  includes a history of both the hmv and rca releases but also provides a context for the 1950s pop scene.
it discusses each 78rpm release individually with scans of every release, plus relevant photographs plus   magazine  articles and adverts.
it also incorporates historically significant events of the period throughout and cross-references with us releases where appropriate.
there are also several picture covers, and interspersed within listing images and information are many âfrom the timeâ news clippings which add historical interest.
 how exciting it must have been to be there as elvis exploded onto the music scene!

elvis in literature #5 "rock and roll - an introduction - was elvis really the king of rock and roll?" (michael campbell and james brody): continuing our irregular series of how elvis is discussed in various publications, in this book two professors of music contend that an analysis of elvis' sun and early rca recordings does not support the commonly accepted claim that elvis was / is the king of rock and roll.

updated 'elvis / memphis' in-depth review: the sony rca 'elvis / memphis'â 2024 5-cd box-set was released last month.
      the publicity promised.. "memphis is a comprehensive collection that takes listeners through the many recordings elvis had done while in memphis - from his songs at sun records, to his american studio and stax sessions, through to his 1974 hometown show and finally, his last recordings in graceland. 
      this 5-cd collection of elvisâ songs over the years features 111 tracks, 88 of which are newly mixed versions of the select recordings, pure and without overdubs."
      the five cds each focus on sun records, american studios, stax studios, live mid-south coliseum memphis and graceland. elvis fans have of course bought these tracks multiple times before and ftd have even released most of the "undubbed masters".
      however with 'elvis / memphis' engineer matt ross-spangâ  remixing these crucial recordings, often creating something unique and new for 2024 and there is much to enjoy.
      in fact listening to this set is like a five-course 'memphis degustation' since every individual recording session has a different flavour and vibe. .

epe future plans: for elvis fans, the really interesting point was when joel weinshanker (majority owner of epe) explained his future plans.
this included the following points
- epe wants to bring back "the life" to graceland of when elvis lived there. 
there has been too much sadness recently.
his idea is to only do new concepts that elvis would do or approve of.
- epe are going to be doing "something special" on the mansion grounds every few months. some fans can participate in, some not.
- the new special tour 'presley for a day' will be unique and expensive, however a fair portion of the profits are going to charity & good things for the local community.
part of this tour will be 'moriahâs house' which was the stable and home for lisa marieâs horse.â  weâre starting with that house.
elvisâ legacy was lisa. elvis said, "the best thing i ever did in my life was have lisa". 
now her daughter riley has taken over and is extraordinary - and solely focused on what is best for elvisâ legacy.





 âour road to fiftyâ is the new plan as they head to the fiftieth anniversary. we have three years until 2027
- there will be three to four new buildings opened on the mansion property. epe will be announcing these and they will be doing things that elvis would have done.
some of the things that elvis designed himself.
- one could be a recording studio built on the property. this was something that elvis not only always wanted, but he designed. in the archives there are architectural drawings for that.
- there will be one new elvis movie between now and 2027 - possibly two.
- baz lurhman is working on his elvis documentary.
there should also be a "streamer" show.
- there is the london âelvis evolutionâ event where youâll be able to go into virtual rooms that elvis was in and interact with all of it.
- the whole thing is that in this world of such quick change, where movies and music are all so disposable, elvis is one of the few things from 70 years ago that is still incredibly relevant. 
elvis was a revolutionary.
- so fans should âspread the gospel of elvisâ.
- elvis always respected his neighbours even he might disagree with them. so please ignore the bad social media, respect your neighbours. ask yourself, "what would elvis do?"
- 
so we are all going to keep going to elevate elvisâ legacy and keep thinkingâ  âwhat would elvis want, what would elvis do?â

(book review) elvis, hero of the comic books (nigel patterson): respected elvis author and reviewer, gordon minto, recently put on his reviewerâs cap to take on what he rightly describes as âa strange landscapeâ of how elvis is portrayed in comic books (aka sequential art), a subject, which until now, has not been well covered or understood. 
                          the book in question, elvis, hero of the comic books, was written by einâs nigel patterson and sublimely designed by elvis day by dayâs, kees mouwen. â 
the book includes stunning artwork from a number of releases and an eclectic variety of elvis related comic book ephemera.  elvis, hero of the comic books features more than 600 images! 
 read gordonâs detailed review to discover why he found the book to be ârefreshingly different, extremely eye-catching, well-researched and well-written, while offering a new slant on thingsâ.â  â

"that's all right" 70 anniversary spotlight: seventy years ago today elvis presley would walk into 706 union avenue and by the end of the evening his recording of 'that's all right' would change the course of music history.
elvis author tony plews' 'walk a lonely street' is a unique book that tells the tale of elvis presleyâs rise to fame and presented as a series of consecutive short stories, it offers a new perspective on presleyâs musical and cultural achievements.

every elvis biography has, of course, described the recording of âthat's all rightâ but none have really captured that special day in such a cool, inspiring, involving and natural way. 
in 'walk a lonely street' itâs as if tony plews was actually there watching...
on this  70th anniversary every elvis fan should read this fabulous spotlight about 'that's all right'.

'elvis: stateline sahara '74' ftd in-depth review: 'elvis: stateline sahara 1974 lake tahoe' released as a 3-cd 5â digi-pak
   features three previously unreleased performances from elvis' third 
  lake tahoe season - 
                          may 19 (evening show), may 20 (midnight show) and may 25 (midnight show).
  just two weeks before this lake tahoe season elvis had been playing to audiences of over 18 thousand at the los angeles forum, so it is understandable if elvis sounds a little more on âcruise-controlâ but being less o-t-t is also a positive in that they sound more intimate.
                          ftd have already released three concerts from this tahoe season plus five of the best tracks from this set.

'the blue hawaii sessions' box-set ftd in-depth review: released last month, 'the blue hawaii sessions' was the eleventh in ftd’s “complete sessions” packages. this is the audio-set that was released earlier as part of 'the making of blue hawaii'. the 8 inch deluxe 4-cd package includes the complete sessions "newly-mixed from the original 3-track tapes", a 24-page booklet with informative flashbacks from musicians, songwriters, session data, memorabilia and global chart information.
the set includes 50 'officially previously unreleased' session outtakes. however most of these have to be 'false-starts'.
there is however over four hours of polynesian influenced material to enjoy and lots of studio banter to eavesdrop on. the set also includes all twenty-nine takes of elvis' classic chart-topper canât help falling in love.
 over 5000 words ein's piers beagley investigates in-depth what this new set offers and whether the previously unreleased outtakes add anything to our understanding of this important soundtrack session.....

'elvis: at 3am sahara tahoe 1973' mrs cd review:  this deluxe 2cd set features two shows from elvis’ may 1973 engagement at the sahara tahoe in lake tahoe, nevada. included is a rare 3am charity performance as well as the midnight show from the previous night. 
both shows for the first time are presented in stereo. 
the accompanying booklet includes memorabilia and rare photos along with liner notes that set the scene.
despite having to perform three concerts in the one evening, elvis was feeling  inspired and although it was 3am he still treated the âmotherâs dayâ benefit more like a closing night performance. elvis was in extremely jovial spirits, teasing the band and adding some crazy lyrics. he also added unique  live versions of âmy wayâ, âfaded loveâ, âfunny how time slips awayâ and a rare âitâs overâ.
with the cassette hiss removed, the musicians and backing-vocals in stereo and elvisâ vocal raised to the correct level, this mrs release sounds just like an rca recorded multi-track and is the best representation of the âreal elvisâ live in 1973 that fans could hope for.

book review 'the king and the jester': elvis author paul belard's new "special interest" book all about elvis and manager col parker is out now.
the cover notes, "as this uncultured philistine said of himself, "i did not know what to make of elvis, or his music. i did not care, but i saw the reaction of the audience says and it was enough for me". parker promptly realised that elvis was his own ticket to wealth."
belard's new 260 page book's  twenty three chapters include, 'the hank snow affair', 'the snowman', 'the lost years', 'the narcissist',â  'world wide tour', 'what could have been' and 'exposing the con man'.
the author makes his disdain for parker known from the outset and he does not hold back about what he sees as one of, if not the biggest, travesties and examples of unscrupulous mismanagement, in show business history!
the book is a very strong read and one that is very much a counterpoint to the recently published "rose colored glasses" account, 'elvis and the colonel: an insider's look at the most legendary partnership in show business', by parker employee greg mcdonald and marshall terrill.
some fans have suggested that baz luhrmannâs 2022 elvis drama made parker out to be too much of a cartoon villain but after reading this book the movie looks even more truthful than fans might have believed. ...

(film review) priscilla â film by sofia coppola: while baz luhrmannâs major hit film in 2022, elvis, was a colorful narrative and frenetic musical explosion, in 2023, sofia coppolaâs, priscilla, is more subdued, but still a colorfully hued and musically expressive story.
 coppola is an acclaimed filmmaker and director. thematically, her films explore themes of identity, isolation, and the complexities of human relationships, and these underscore, priscilla.
 einâs nigel patterson recently watched the film that has divided the elvis world.

updated- cd review 'the joan deary tapes vol1' - and has ernst won the war?’: two years ago ein posted an article suggesting that the elvis bootleg era was over, that ftd and ernst jorgensen had truly won the war. 
      so it was a surprise to many that a new bootleg label âjoan deary incâ suddenly popped up two months ago promising a very similar series of releases to the madison âa legendary performerâ set.
      they promised "unique content... with never issued before outtakes. some very different mixes among other glorious sounding tracks. every track comes in great sound quality and has been remastered for optimal listening pleasure..."
      ein was suspicious from the start - to be honest i saw no need to purchase this cd - but several ein readers wanted to know more before they put down their hard earned cash.

 'elvis on tour' box-set in-depth review: the january 2023 'elvis on tour' sony release is a 6cd / 1 blu-ray box set comprised of the audio from four of the shows (and two rehearsals) that were part of elvisâ 1972 north american tour. 
        originally recorded for the elvis on tour concert film that was released later that year, the set features a total of 145 tracks, including 91 previously unreleased tracks, as well as the award-winning concert film on blu-ray.

elvis live aug 23, 1969 album review + elvis concert review 1969: ... "the atmosphere throughout the entire hotel was nail-bitingly electric! it is difficult for me to describe and paint a true portrait of attending in person this unique occasion - elvis' return to splendor live in 1969 - but i'll try my best.â  i want, and hope, you will understand the excitement of what has to be the pinnacle of elvis' career to date!"

'what was elvis searching for?' ein spotlight: the question is raised â but never answered â in the title of hboâs recent absorbing, imperfect documentary 'elvis presley: the searcher'.
                      at the start it seems clear what the teenage elvis was searching for â an escape from the oblivion of poverty in the american south. yet his quest was cultural as well as financial. 
                      later elvis read obsessively, seeking out such books as the impersonal life, joseph brennerâs guide to self-discovery and kahil gibranâs book of fables, the prophet. in his copy of gibranâs tome, elvis jotted down the line: âa singer can sing his songs but he must have an ear to receive the songâ. 
                      so what exactly was elvis searching for?                        in this fascinating ein spotlight respected author paul simpson takes a close look at this all important question which, for some reason, was basically ignored in the recent hbo documentary..

mindi miller interview with ein: mindi miller was a working actress when she met elvis in early 1975. she was interested in karate (she performed all her own movie stunts), exploring spirituality and the bible and so they had a lot in common.
mindi miller and elvis bonded over their common interests and soon afterwards he asked her to go on tour with him in april 1975.
  she stayed friends with elvis through the years - along with members of the 'memphis mafia' - and attended his funeral.
  ein's sanja meegin recently caught up with mindi miller to talk about her close friendship with elvis over the years.
  in this fascinating interview she discusses. . . 
- her first night with elvis
  - how elvis persuaded her to cancel her overseas movie & modelling plans

'marty lacker: a life well-lived' & elvis at american studio's interview: it was with immense sadness that last month ein had to report on the death of our great friend - and a true friend to elvis - marty lacker. we will miss him dearly.
marty is well-known as one of the key members of the memphis mafia and also co-best man at elvis' wedding. he was known for both his honesty and being forthright with his opinions. he was the only member of the memphis mafia who still watched and commented on recent elvis news. he had no issue with holding people to account (especially ones who would inflate their importance within elvis' legacy) and would regularly  ask ein to add his comments or to correct any inaccuracy.
elvis fans often ask about marty lacker's background, how he came to meet elvis, as well as his involvement in the music industry outside of working for the king.
as a prelude to ken sharp's fascinating interview with marty lacker and a discussion about elvis' famous american studio' memphis sessions, ein presents "marty lacker: a life well-lived" in which marty tells of his life in the music industry, his friendship with elvis along with his dislike of the over-controlling col parker.

did elvis record 'tiger man' at sun?: a question that has puzzled elvis fans through the years is whether he actually recorded the song âtiger manâ during his years at sun studios.
the basic question is why did elvis refer to 'tiger man' several times in concert as âthe second song that i ever recorded, not too many people heard itâ?
and if elvis did record it, then why hasnât any reference to it at sun or proof of its existence been found?
elvis would first perform âtiger manâ in concert at his first 1969 las vegas international season and would continue playing it through the years â usually in a medley with mystery train - until his last performance at saginaw on may 3 1977. he would sing it over 150 times on stage!
the thought that there might be an acetate or undiscovered tape of elvis at sun singing âtiger manâ is a mouth-watering concept - but is it an unlikely fantasy or strong possibility?
go here to our detailed 'tiger man' spotlight as ein's piers beagley puts in the hard yards to check the facts from the fantasy .
