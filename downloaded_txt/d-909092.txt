just a quote





i'm busy writing an essay that is due tomorrow, because i've spent that last week pottering around it without getting into the meat. so i thought i'd leave you with a quote, from yes i'm afraid so, stephen king, 'the literary equivalent of a big mac and fries.' it has some sort of truth with myself."people want to know why i do this, why i write such gross stuff. i like to tell them i have the heart of a small boy... and i keep it in a jar on my desk." - stephen king

a boost back to blogging





chilout : children out of detentioni told you all about my article a few weeks ago that was published in 'the rights of man' quarterly. well it was mentioned at the above link on chilout.org. for those who do not who chilout are, they are a major advocacy group for refugee rights and to be added to their articles archive is a very big deal. after brad's post i wasn't feeling too good, but after this and a call from my aunty about how much she loved my website i'm feeling much better.tonight i registered my domain name and have begun to think about the redesign for the new site.

blogger in limbo





in light of last weeks post at blog'd, i've been taking a break from blogging. in response to claims that i cannot handle criticism, let me say this. brad's post was not criticism but nothing more than cheap slander that hides his own insecurities as a person. honestly, i've been hurt by this.i may or may not return to blogging, but for now i'd rather not.

hawthorne manor





hawthorne manorwarning: this topic may be limited to the realm of the nerdsi found this site last night after reading an article for university about text-based role play games and the relation to the idea of the self. i was curious, as a writer, to find out how i might come across such a game and found this place. you create a 'character' and describe your interactions with other characters through words and it is an extremely good exercise for creative minds. this role-play is based in a haunted house. if you're not too ashamed at entering the realm of the nerds than go check it out.

a .net/.com without the f***ing credit card





again i have brought my mind back to the subject of buying .com and some paid web space with no ads and no pop-up and it will be all mine. i occasionally browse the web and have found some great prices for domain names and hosting. the domain names i am after are available and quite accessible. but there is a fucking problem. i cannot get a domain or hosting package because i don’t have a ‘debt collector’ i.e. a fucking credit card. i have the money to pay for this because of the great prices going around at the moment, but cannot pay for it without some stupid bit of plastic that i can’t get and i don’t want.if someone could find me, or knows of a hosting/domain company that…- is preferably australian- has a hosting package that can be used with wordpress- doesn’t have to pay via credit card- can be paid monthly, preferablyis it that hard?

vsu to be crushed by defectors.





student union bill in peril as nats defy pm - national - smh.com.au  the watertight destruction of the working class in the bloody hands of john howard has seemed to spring some leaks. first there were reports that a queensland nation senator may cross the floor on howard’s attempt to destroy unions, and destroy the rights of workers. now, another two more senators from the national party, with many more to follow, may block another one of howard’s attacks, the removal of student unionism. student unionism which is the basis of extra curricular funding, student’s rights and the political voice of students would be removed under the new legislation and replaced by a controversial voluntary system which would see the decline of the student voice. this sign that vsu (voluntary student unionism) and the destruction of unions will not go ahead due to defecting senators is very promising, and we can, in part, thank to people who have lobbied for these causes, just like the refugee activists have.
