the dda group is committed to advancing equality, diversity and inclusion in our agency and our industry, both collectively and as individuals. we recognise that as a sector we need to do more to be actively anti-racist, and champion the work and careers of colleagues and creatives who experience discrimination, while also creating more equitable working environments. as a conduit into the industry through our long-standing internship programme – we are focussing on ensuring that we make our hiring and recruitment processes more diverse and freer of bias, more fairly compensated, and more meaningful to new entrants into the entertainment and communications sector. our aim is to offer everyone a seat at our table. we want to build a culture at the dda group that prizes meritocracy, openness, fairness and transparency – and recognise that takes work. we will actively condemn and address any discrimination, bullying, racism, or harassment which occurs, in keeping with these values.we also partner with the creative mentor network to lend our support to their work with young people from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds.
