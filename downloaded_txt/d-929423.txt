						independent pictures						




						independent pictures was founded in 1993 by filmmakers looking for venues for independent work, particularly independent work from filmmakers who are not yet commercially successful.  originally called the off-hollywood flick fest and renamed the ohio independent film festival, the event gained followers by offering audiences truly independent films they wouldn’t ordinarily see: films that have not been picked up for theatrical distribution.   independent pictures is a 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit.  since 2020, ip has been focusing solely on supporting filmmakers through the fiscal sponsorship program.
