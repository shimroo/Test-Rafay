drain

      “straight up, no one is having more fun than me when we’re up there!” beams drain frontman sammy ciaramitaro, whose face is perpetually glued in a grin. for anyone that’s seen the santa cruz hardcore firebrands live, there’s no mistaking that fact. drain isn’t just a good time as sammy presides over the chaos of stagediving bodies and mic-grabbing frontline; it’s a party—and everyone is invited. (dolphin shorts and boogie boards are optional but encouraged.) “the vibe of it is, enthusiastic, hectic,” says the vocalist. “five people deep singing and stagediving, then kids going berserk behind that. it’s a great vibe and i think people pick up on that.” 
 
that, in a nutshell is drain. the quartet inject a serious dose of relatability—not to mention catchiness—into hardcore’s penchant for toughness and brutality on their epitaph debut living proof. ciaramitaro’s desperate, snotty howl rides roughshod over thrash-leaning riffage as rhythms bounce in a big way. if you’re picturing the pacific ocean waves that rise and fall along the coastal town, occasionally violently so, you’re not far off.

royale lynn

      royale lynn brings a signature blend of hard rock and country to life with fearless ambition. 
 
a small-town girl turned nashville singer/songwriter, lynn grew up with avril lavigne and breaking benjamin in her cd walkman and makes music with gutsy abandon and charm. lynn’s songs resonate with folks equally cozy at stagecoach festival or sonic temple.  
 
heralded by billboard as “a ferocious newcomer with ceiling-scraping vocals,” royale lynn’s boundary-smashing amalgamation of hard rock and country demonstrates the growing appetite for her brand of genre-bending.   
 
“i know there are a lot of people who grew up in the country that love rock, and vice versa,” lynn reasons. “i want to bring together a community of people who embrace being different and who are open to talking about mental health in small towns.” 
 
that coming together is already well underway, as evidenced by the success of self-released singles like “six feet deep” (which blew up on tiktok and instagram) and “redneck rockstar.” over one million people around the world listened to royale lynn on spotify alone in 2023. “six feet deep” acquired over 20 million social media views between facebook reels, instagram and tik tok.  it shot to no. 1 on billboard’s hard rock digital sales chart.  
 
the earnest resolve, huge hooks, and catchy melodies of songs like “rocket man,” and “runs in the water” are undeniable. she played dozens of shows in 2023, including support slots with luke combs, eli young band, and jarrod niemann, as well as a slew of headlining gigs across the country. in november 2023, she signed a worldwide deal with epitaph records. 
 
the sky’s the limit as royale lynn shares more of her music and herself with the world. “i just want to create,” she says. “if i sound more rock on some days and more country on others? who cares? why stay in a box? i won’t stay in a box. it’s just not something i can do and remain authentically myself.”
