ruby's clay studio & gallery




ruby’s clay studio & gallery has been in the heart of the castro since 1967.  ruby’s offers a place for creativity and community, serving a range of studio users from preschoolers whose work is fired for free as part of our community outreach program, to adults taking a clay class for the first time, and to those that are hobby and professional artists.  ruby’s clay studio & gallery keeps studio costs low by enlisting hundreds of hours of volunteer service and through careful financial planning.  artists working in clay are often dependent on sharing space and necessary equipment.  please consider helping us in continuing to keep ruby’s clay studio & gallery an arts center whose objectives are to promote community appreciation of the ceramic arts and to encourage self-expression and technical and artistic development through exhibitions, classes and the resources provided by a shared learning facility for many years to come.
