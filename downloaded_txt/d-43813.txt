hair pulling and the like are very much not a choice, and it is usually not a stress response gone too far.
a bfrb is not a phase which people usually grow out of and recovery requires guidance, tools, treatment and support.
with early appropriate treatment, dedication and hard work, bfrb recovery is possible. the sooner you get help, the greater the chance of a full recovery, but it is never too late to become pick free.
if you have concerns that you or someone close to you has trichotillomania, it is advisable to take the issue seriously, and to seek support.

many people with bfrbs also find themselves faced with rapid, recurring and unhelpful thoughts, fears or images. they may also have other compulsions which they perform, feeling that these alleviate their anxiety.¬† those with these conditions are usually aware that their behaviours and sometimes their thoughts, differ from others‚Äô. this can lead to shame and a lack of sharing.for someone with a body focused repetitive behavior, it can be extremely hard and almost impossible to move on from distressing thoughts and the unwanted behaviour can seem the only way. the behaviour then activates intense shame and sadness, and the cycle starts again.¬† 



together, we change our world for the better 







thank you for visiting bfrb support charity. you are not alone, and with the right bfrb support, healing and recovery are possible. join us in our mission to support, educate, and empower those affected by bfrbs.
