about kickapoo located 30 minutes east of champaign-urbana and 10 minutes west of danville, the kickapoo mountain bike trails and kmbc were established in 1993. with the new addition of trial 10, you’ll find 18+ miles of singletrack bike trail at kickapoo (all of which is unidirectional) with an additional 5+ miles of gravel/dirt road. the trails have signage and offer a variety of challenges for every level of rider.  roots, rocks, off-camber trail, climbs, descents, flow, creek-crossings, extraordinary views overlooking lakes and the “national wild and scenic” middle fork river — kickapoo has it all.  these features and a dedicated force of kmbc volunteers make these trails some of the best in the midwest. notice: illinois department of natural resources prohibits the use of motorized vehicles on the kickapoo mountain bike trails — including e-bikes.  historya demand for mountain bike trails at kickapoo state park, along with a lack of state funding, led to the club forming in 1993. park leadership agreed to allow volunteers to build and maintain trails on over 1,000 acres of land in the northeast corner of kickapoo state park. with the formation of kickapoo mountain bike club (kmbc), local trail riders can now safely and responsibly build, maintain, and ride new trail. kmbc also works closely with the illinois department of natural resources, as well as the kickapoo state park superintendent, to ensure that there is as little impact on the environment as possible. kmbc’s workkickapoo mountain bike club, with the assistance of park employees and local businesses, has constructed 18+ miles of unidirectional, singletrack trail, which has been mapped and signed by kmbc volunteers. kiosks were constructed and erected at several different locations on trail in 2016.in 2018 kmbc received approval to build a new 3+ mile loop adjacent to trail 1 and completed this work in spring 2019 with nearly 700 volunteer hours.  trail 1 is a fun, flowy and scenic trail which offers views high above kickapoo’s lakes and the “national wild and scenic” middle fork river.
