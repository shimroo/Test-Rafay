	 supaman dat hoe-explanation
	 
    


      i haven't posted in a while for personal reasons, but i had to post this because it is the funniest mess i've read in a long time. lmbao-fa sho~ i really must be getting old, because this is foreign to me."haters get mad cuz i got me some bathin' apes!" lolsupaman dat hoe-explanationdo y'all really know what "superman dat ho" means? i know i didn't andthe answer is some of the most shocking and funniest sh*t i've heardsince i first learned what a "dirty sanchez" is or when my boy told meabout "riding the bull".so here's the deal. most dudes (myself included) has been in thesituation when you've been trying all night to sleep with a certainyoung lady. y'all have been messing around for hours and you've triedeverything from "i'll still respect you in the morning" to "just let meput the head in" but she keeps shutting you down hard like a faulty cartrunk.- well, according to our songwriter/rapper soldija boy, now's the timeto give up and "superman dat ho"!!!i'll try to keep this as clean as possible for those of you who readthis at work . so basically, you let her fall asleep and you commenceto.............. "take things into your own hands", you know, make it a partyfor one! hopefully you catch my drift by now. you then "release" on herback while she's sleeping.- next, you take the sheets and cover her up with your little soldiersstill on her back. what happens next is actually the funny part!throughout the night, your liquid love will dry and wind up sticking thesheet to that lovely lady's back. when she awakens the next morning,she'll stand up with a sheet stuck to her back like a cape!my friend, you have just supermanned dat ho!!! i will say that i've never done it but, i can't front, i kinda want to now lol lol!!!she has a cape!!!

      i'm blaming trimspa.  but that's just me.  anna nicole smith's media-hyped journey of celebrity, marked by dubious successes and all-too-human tragedies, ended thursday at a venue as colorful as her life when she collapsed at the seminole hard rock hotel & casino and died at a florida hospital.  nearby residents and casino patrons said smith, a former stripper turned playboy playmate, diet maven, reality show star and prospective multi-millionaire, frequented the hotel on the indian reservation and was known for partying loud and late.five months after the birth of her daughter and the death of her 20-year-old son, smith, 39, was found unconscious around 1:39 p.m., when her private nurse called hotel staff for help, seminole tribe police chief charlie tiger said. at 1:45, tiger said, a bodyguard started cpr in smith's hotel room, no. 607.complete story
