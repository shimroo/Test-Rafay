stretchy and beanie

what’s an independent cat to do when his friend decides she’s the leader of their pack? this story of friendship and power dynamics is a read-aloud joy.
beanie, a ginger-haired girl with a fierce heart, is the perfect pal for her newfound companion, stretchy mchandsome the cat. that is, until beanie gets it into her head that she should teach stretchy how to be a perfect pet. her lessons really curl his whiskers, and when hiding from beanie isn’t enough, he has to take an even bigger leap. then it’s beanie who needs a lesson of her own: how to be an accepting friend rather than a bossy-boots.  find out more.
