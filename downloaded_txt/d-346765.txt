choppers
are
the people who ride them- they're inventive, fast and free, and of course,
they're resisting repression. there's a grain of boldness in everything
chopperhedz
do. and that boldness, that spirit of
individuality, that proverbial
"i am," speaks a language that isn't heard in mass produced machines.
.
the
bikes
of chopperhedz are built to threaten convention and
inspire
individuality. our bikes are a uniquely american form of motorcycle,
just as jazz is a uniquely american form of music.
.
this
site is a dedicated tribute to the solitary souls who split the
night with their ungodly roar searching for whatever is left of the great
frontier.
