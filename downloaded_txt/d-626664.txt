about the alliance midwest district


we are together
our family of churches and leaders are better together than we are alone. each church and each worker are seen and heard.
the geographical boundaries of the midwest district of the christian and missionary alliance include illinois and indiana.  across the two states nearly seventy local churches and ministries span the social economic and ethnic spectrum reaching into the heart of the urban centers, impacting the medium size cities, and venturing out into the vastness of the rural landscape.  ministry is facilitated in ten different languages presented in multiple formats all centered on getting to know christ as savior, sanctifier, healer and coming king so that we may effectively engage the mission christ commissioned his church to complete.
our district office is conveniently located on the west side of indianapolis, and we are working hard at creating a welcoming and resourceful space for you to use.  we mean it.  we’d love for you to come visit!  in the meantime, we invite you to contact us or to visit the rest of this site to see more of what god is accomplishing through the family of churches of the midwest district.

family is key


geo groups
geo groups are the smaller parts of our district family, formed by geographic regions.  we participate in these groups because we believe we are better together than we are alone. geo groups aim to pull district workers and families together because we value culture and practice over personality and programs. we are much more interested in a healthy soul, mind, and body at both the personal and corporate levels. we possess a deep desire to engage god in his fullness and are earnest for revival.
find your geo group
below are the geo group coordinators for different regions in our district.  reach out to them so they can get to know you better and share information on their gathering times.

from the wordand we all, with unveiled face, continually seeing as in a mirror the glory of the lord, are progressively being transformed into his image from [one degree of] glory to [even more] glory, which comes from the lord, [who is] the spirit.2 corinthians 3:18,  ampfor we are his workmanship, created in christ jesus for good works, which god prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.ephesians 2:10,  esvremain in me, and i [will remain] in you. just as no branch can bear fruit by itself without remaining in the vine, neither can you [bear fruit, producing evidence of your faith] unless you remain in me. i am the vine; you are the branches. the one who remains in me and i in him bears much fruit, for [otherwise] apart from me [that is, cut off from vital union with me] you can do nothing.john 15:4-5,  amptherefore if anyone is in christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.  now all these things are from god, who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and he has committed to us the word of reconciliation.  therefore, we are ambassadors for christ, as though god were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of christ, be reconciled to god.2 corinthians 5:17-20,  ampbut he said to me, “my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that christ’s power may rest on me. that is why, for christ’s sake, i delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. for when i am weak, then i am strong.2 corinthians 12:9-10,  nivbut those who hope in the lord will renew their strength. they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.isaiah 40:31,  niv
