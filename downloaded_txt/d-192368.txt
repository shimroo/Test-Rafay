tom lake


in this beautiful and moving novel about family, love, and growing up, ann patchett once again proves herself one of america's finest writers.in the spring of 2020, lara's three daughters return to the family's orchard in northern michigan. while picking cherries, they beg their mother to tell them the story of peter duke, a famous actor with whom she shared both a stage and a romance years before at a theater company called tom lake. as lara recalls the past, her daughters examine their own lives and relationship with their mother, and are forced to reconsider the world and everything they thought they knew.tom lake is a meditation on youthful love, married love, and the lives parents have led before their children were born. both hopeful and elegiac, it explores what it means to be happy even when the world is falling apart. as in all of her novels, ann patchett combines compelling narrative artistry with piercing insights into family dynamics. the result is a rich and luminous story, told with profound intelligence and emotional subtlety, that demonstrates once again why she is one of the most revered and acclaimed literary talents working today.











weather girl


a tv meteorologist and a sports reporter scheme to reunite their divorced bosses with unforecasted results in this electrifying romance from the author of the ex talk.ari abrams has always been fascinated by the weather, and she loves almost everything about her job as a tv meteorologist. her boss, legendary seattle weatherwoman torrance hale, is too distracted by her tempestuous relationship with her ex-husband, the station’s news director, to give ari the mentorship she wants. ari, who runs on sunshine and optimism, is at her wits’ end. the only person who seems to understand how she feels is sweet but reserved sports reporter russell barringer.in the aftermath of a disastrous holiday party, ari and russell decide to team up to solve their bosses’ relationship issues. between secret gifts and double dates, they start nudging their bosses back together. but their well-meaning meddling backfires when the real chemistry builds between ari and russell.working closely with russell means allowing him to get to know parts of herself that ari keeps hidden from everyone. will he be able to embrace her dark clouds as well as her clear skies?











the gentle art of swedish death cleaning


a charming, practical, and unsentimental approach to putting a home in order while reflecting on the tiny joys that make up a long life.in sweden there is a kind of decluttering called döstädning, dö meaning “death” and städning meaning “cleaning.” this surprising and invigorating process of clearing out unnecessary belongings can be undertaken at any age or life stage but should be done sooner than later, before others have to do it for you. in the gentle art of swedish death cleaning, artist margareta magnusson, with scandinavian humor and wisdom, instructs readers to embrace minimalism. her radical and joyous method for putting things in order helps families broach sensitive conversations, and makes the process uplifting rather than overwhelming.margareta suggests which possessions you can easily get rid of (unworn clothes, unwanted presents, more plates than you’d ever use) and which you might want to keep (photographs, love letters, a few of your children’s art projects). digging into her late husband’s tool shed, and her own secret drawer of vices, margareta introduces an element of fun to a potentially daunting task. along the way readers get a glimpse into her life in sweden, and also become more comfortable with the idea of letting go.











divine rivals


when two young rival journalists find love through a magical connection, they must face the depths of hell, in a war among gods, to seal their fate forever.after centuries of sleep, the gods are warring again. but eighteen-year-old iris winnow just wants to hold her family together. her mother is suffering from addiction and her brother is missing from the front lines. her best bet is to win the columnist promotion at the oath gazette.to combat her worries, iris writes letters to her brother and slips them beneath her wardrobe door, where they vanish—into the hands of roman kitt, her cold and handsome rival at the paper. when he anonymously writes iris back, the two of them forge a connection that will follow iris all the way to the front lines of battle: for her brother, the fate of mankind, and love.shadow and bone meets lore in rebecca ross's divine rivals, an epic enemies-to-lovers fantasy novel filled with hope and heartbreak, and the unparalleled power of love.











know my name


universally acclaimed, rapturously reviewed, and an instant new york times bestseller, chanel miller's breathtaking memoir "gives readers the privilege of knowing her not just as emily doe, but as chanel miller the writer, the artist, the survivor, the fighter." (the wrap). her story of trauma and transcendence illuminates a culture biased to protect perpetrators, indicting a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and, ultimately, shining with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life.know my name will forever transform the way we think about sexual assault, challenging our beliefs about what is acceptable and speaking truth to the tumultuous reality of healing. entwining pain, resilience, and humor, this memoir will stand as a modern classic.











the violin conspiracy


growing up black in rural north carolina, ray mcmillian’s life is already mapped out. but ray has a gift and a dream—he’s determined to become a world-class professional violinist, and nothing will stand in his way. not his mother, who wants him to stop making such a racket; not the fact that he can’t afford a violin suitable to his talents; not even the racism inherent in the world of classical music.  when he discovers that his beat-up, family fiddle is actually a priceless stradivarius, all his dreams suddenly seem within reach, and together, ray and his violin take the world by storm. but on the eve of the renowned and cutthroat tchaikovsky competition—the olympics of classical music—the violin is stolen, a ransom note for five million dollars left in its place. without it, ray feels like he's lost a piece of himself. as the competition approaches, ray must not only reclaim his precious violin, but prove to himself—and the world—that no matter the outcome, there has always been a truly great musician within him.











elatsoe


a texas teen comes face-to-face with a cousin's ghost and vows to unmask the murderer.elatsoe--ellie for short--lives in an alternate contemporary america shaped by the ancestral magics and knowledge of its indigenous and immigrant groups. she can raise the spirits of dead animals--most importantly, her ghost dog kirby. when her beloved cousin dies, all signs point to a car crash, but his ghost tells her otherwise: he was murdered.who killed him and how did he die? with the help of her family, her best friend jay, and the memory great, great, great, great, great, great grandmother, elatsoe, must track down the killer and unravel the mystery of this creepy town and it's dark past. but will the nefarious townsfolk and a mysterious doctor stop her before she gets started?a breathtaking debut novel featuring an asexual, apache teen protagonist, elatsoe combines mystery, horror, noir, ancestral knowledge, haunting illustrations, fantasy elements, and is one of the most-talked about debuts of the year.











something


"when i know a friend is hurting then my heart starts aching too, like it's asking me a question . . . is there something i can do?"based on a familiar passage from matthew 25, this picture book explores themes of compassion and empathy, encouraging children to take positive action when they see a need in the world around them. from big things--like helping to plant a community garden or trying to find a home for an animal in need--to small things--like making a card or welcoming someone new--there is always something we can do! the book's lyrical refrain will stick with kids long after the book is closed: "if there's something that you notice, there is something you can do. keep your kindness radar working--maybe something starts with you!" immerse your little one in a world of kindness and hope with this gorgeously illustrated offering from natalee creech.











the mostly true story of tanner & louise


twenty-one-year-old tanner quimby needs a place to live. preferably one where she can continue sitting around in sweatpants and playing video games nineteen hours a day. since she has no credit or money to speak of, her options are limited, so when an opportunity to work as a live-in caregiver for an elderly woman falls into her lap, she takes it. one slip on the rug. that’s all it took for louise wilt’s daughter to demand that louise have a full-time nanny living with her. never mind that she can still walk fine, finish her daily crossword puzzle, and pour the two fingers of vodka she drinks every afternoon. bottom line: louise wants a caretaker even less than tanner wants to be one. the two start off their living arrangement happily ignoring each other until tanner starts to notice things—weird things. like, why does louise keep her garden shed locked up tighter than a prison? and why is the local news fixated on the suspect of one of the biggest jewelry heists in american history who looks eerily like louise? and why does louise suddenly appear in her room, with a packed bag at 1 a.m.  insisting that they leave town immediately?  thus begins the story of a not-to-be-underestimated elderly woman and an aimless young woman who—if they can outrun the mistakes of their past—might just have the greatest adventure of their lives.











all together now


the small town of bridgeford is in crisis. downtown is deserted, businesses are closing, and the idea of civic pride seems old-fashioned to residents rushing through the streets to get somewhere else. bridgeford seems to have lost its heart. but there is one thing that just might unite the community -- music. the local choir, a group generally either ignored or mocked by most of bridgeford's inhabitants, is preparing for an important contest, and to win it they need new members, and a whole new sound. enlisting (some may say drafting) singers, who include a mother suffering from empty-nest syndrome, a middle-aged man who has just lost his job and his family, and a nineteen-year-old waitress who dreams of reality-tv stardom, the choir regulars must find -- and make -- harmony with neighbors they've been happy not to know for years. can they all learn to work together, save the choir, and maybe even save their town in the process? all together now is a poignant and charming novel about community, family, falling in love -- and the big rewards of making a small change.











wonder


i won't describe what i look like. whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.  august pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. starting 5th grade at beecher prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past auggie’s extraordinary face. beginning from auggie’s point of view and expanding to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others, the perspectives converge to form a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. in a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope.r.j. palacio has called her debut novel “a meditation on kindness” —indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.  











the luminaries


hemlock falls isn't like other towns. you won't find it on a map, your phone won't work here, and the forest outside town might just kill you. winnie wednesday wants nothing more than to join the luminaries, the ancient order that protects winnie's town—and the rest of humanity—from the monsters and nightmares that rise in the forest of hemlock falls every night. ever since her father was exposed as a witch and a traitor, winnie and her family have been shunned. but on her sixteenth birthday, she can take the deadly luminary hunter trials and prove herself true and loyal—and restore her family's good name. or die trying.but in order to survive, winnie enlists the help of the one person who can help her train: jay friday, resident bad boy and winnie’s ex-best friend. while jay might be the most promising new hunter in hemlock falls, he also seems to know more about the nightmares of the forest than he should. together, he and winnie will discover a danger lurking in the forest no one in hemlock falls is prepared for.not all monsters can be slain, and not all nightmares are confined to the dark."you'll want to get lost in the world of the luminaries again and again.”—leigh bardugo, #1 new york times bestselling author

outlive


#1 new york times bestseller • over two million copies sold • a groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert “one of the most important books you’ll ever read.”—steven d. levitt, new york times bestselling author of freakonomicsan economist and bloomberg best book of the yearwouldn’t you like to live longer? and better? in this operating manual for longevity, dr. peter attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health. for all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. dr. attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting. this is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. dr. attia’s aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. in outlive, readers will discover: • why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn’t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack.• that you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging.• why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity “drug”—and how to begin training for the “centenarian decathlon.”• why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern.• why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all. aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. with the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.
