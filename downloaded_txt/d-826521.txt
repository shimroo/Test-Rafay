welcome to lebanon valley family ymca
the original lebanon valley family ymca started modestly in 1898 – where a small group of men gathered who were interested in building a better community. since its inception, the lebanon valley family ymca has been a respected nonprofit institution, serving the entire community as a source of health and wellness, recreation, enrichment, after school programs and numerous other services for children and teens.
the original constitution and bylaws of the lebanon valley family ymca express the following, “the object shall be the spiritual, intellectual, social and physical welfare of young men.” we remain true to our historical mission founded on christian values. today, our purpose is to improve the quality of life in our community by offering programs, services and facilities that promote strong families, good health, fitness, wellness, community services, child and adult development with equality for all. we encourage a sensitivity to the physical, mental and spiritual enhancement of all persons regardless of age, sex, race, religious affiliation or economic status.
