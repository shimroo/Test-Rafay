jan 25, 2025 -
additional information - tmc gpr-90 series 
		of receivers - during the 
		restoration of gpr-90 sn:1893, i discovered that the z-matching, ferrite 
		core transformer t1 was shorted. this seems to be a relatively common 
		problem with the gpr-90. even though the receiver seems to somewhat 
		operate, a shorted t1 will affect the proper operation of the rf gain 
		control, the avc and other issues. since t1 is a "custom part" with no 
		easily available substitute, i built a replica that looks like t1 and 
		works like a good t1 should. all of the necessary information is 
		provided to allow building a replica t1 for your gpr-90 (if needed.) the 
		ferrite core necessary is easy to purchase and inexpensive. 30 gauge 
		magnet wire is needed and a few other easy to find items. detailed data 
		about the construction of the original t1 and detailed instructions and 
		lots of photos of the t1 replication process is included. -

new article - 
		the technical materiel corporation gpr-90 series of receivers 
		- producing the gpr-90 receiver wasn't tmcs primary business focus. 
		tmc's output of commercial-military radio electronic equipment was 
		vast,...staggering in the enormous quantity of different equipment they 
		produced. their one "ham receiver" was the gpr-90 but its "spin-offs" 
		form an impressive collection of commercial-military radio receivers. 
		covered are the gpr-90 ham receiver and its military variants, then the 
		military-commercial 
		gpr-90rx, gpr-90rxd and the gpr-92. various accessories, including the 
		gsb-1 ssb adapter for the gpr-90 and the commercial-military msr-type ssb 
		adapters are covered. detailed circuit descriptions, a detailed analysis 
		of the internet reviews of the gpr-90, reworking a gpr-90rxd and its 
		matching msr-6 ssb adapter. a performance review of the 
		gpr-90rxd operated with the msr-6. lots of info and lots of photos.

expanded article 
		- hallicrafters sx-28 and sx-28a - 
this sx-28 write-up was first uploaded 
		onto this website in 2005, nearly 20 years ago,...certainly it's time for an update or 
		two. i've added a new receiver to the receiver profiles,  the 
model sx-28 fcc 
		version. these fcc versions were built for the radio intelligence division, the rid, at 
		the fcc. this receiver is one of the earliest of the sx-28s and is from the 
		very first production run. i've also added some of the paper items that 
		aren't seen very often such as a sx-28 warranty card, two dated 
		inspection tags and other paper pieces. the entire write-up was edited 
		with lots of new additions and information. many new photographs and 
		lots of new information. -

		hammarlund sp-600-vlf long wave receiver 
		- detailed write-up on this version of the super pro sp-600 that tunes 
		from 540kc down to 10kc. circuit description, operation, performance 
		using both loop antenna or long wire antenna. details on maintaining the 
		sp-600-vlf including the how to fix the infamous "slipping" tuning dial 
		(works for the hf sp-600 too.) 
		the unusable hammarlund manual is critically reviewed and concludes 
		that the manual's alignment procedure was never used by commercial 
		technicians for sp-600-vlf alignment. instead, a new complete alignment 
		procedure is presented that follows a conventional and easy approach to 
		perform a sweep alignment of the sp-600-vlf's if section with full details 
		and photos showing the oscilloscope images. i've owned and used my 
		sp-600-vlf for over a decade so there's lots and lots of detailed

		1933 usn rag-1 long wave receiver - 
interfacing an original power unit 
		chs-20032 with the 1933 usn rag-1 required some circuit analysis of the 
		unusual hygrade-sylvania circuits in both the receiver and the power 
		unit. major component value change was required since the ct b- return 
		was through the sensitivity pot in the rag-1 (original pot was missing, 
		so original value was unknown but was calculated after the original 
		chs-20032 became available.) the complete story on getting both of these
