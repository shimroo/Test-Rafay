"emmaus equipped me for life beyond graduation. i am grateful i was able to be educated about the business world through the lens of biblical teaching. i was able to obtain a full time job before i graduated because my employer saw that emmaus turned out thoughtful attentive students who would bring honesty and personal connection to the workplace."







grace volgarino
















"i started off my university career at a huge university on the east coast, and after transferring, i woke up grateful everyday that i was getting my education at emmaus. the professors know you more than just by your name and studying under their knowledge and wisdom, kindness and compassion, and love for the lord is such an honor and blessing. the counseling and psychology department allowed me to grow not just in my knowledge but in my heart for the lord to discover my passion: working with others for the glory of god."







kasey jason
















"my years at emmaus were some of the most enjoyable and rewarding years of my life. not only was i able to learn more about my future career, but i was also able to enjoy learning more about god's word. the faculty members were very personal and gave much care and attention to the students in the education program."
