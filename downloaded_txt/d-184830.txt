                            range of products at competitive prices, with a full package of services to compliment our
                            selection. by combining the buying power of our membership, we negotiate specialized

                            may be insignificant to a large manufacturer. with a coast-to-coast network, battery
                            alliance offers its members the most comprehensive suite of products and services at optimum
                            prices, with payment terms to suit their operations.

testimonials



"battery alliance has maintained great customer service over the years and that is a
                                    big reason we do business with them. it is not a circus to order things like the
                                    other buying groups in the business. pat is always a pleasure to speak with and
                                    handles customer service issues in a timely manner. also, baiâs ease of completing
                                    transactions and payment terms is unmatched in the industry."

"we have been a member of battery alliance for over 15 years. over that time battery
                                    alliance has helped us as a small company grow our business by offering us
                                    competitive wholesale cost. this has helped us compete with bigger companies yet
                                    keep our own independence. whenever we need help they have always been a phone call
                                    away, the staff has always been helpful to resolve problems or just answer
                                    questions. they are always looking for new vendors to help us grow our business and
                                    new ways to work with us to keep us growing our business."

"intermountain battery has had an affiliation with battery alliance for the past 30
                                    years, and it has been exceptional. the customer service that we have received on
                                    our account has been superior. it is well above average and they are always
                                    professional, as well as willing to understand our customer needs and deadlines.
                                    battery alliance has always been more than fair on any issues that have come about.
                                    their staff is up to date on new market strategies and product lines."
