our testimonials




brought a big group of boy scouts down for an overnight paddle, what a great outfitter! they understood the complexity of getting a group like that down the river and helped at every step of the way. highly recommend!

experience instant and undeniable peace. from the moment we started to the instant you finish it is an awesome experience. they are dog friendly and have some great staff. you are literally in control of your canoe trip. highly recommend this to all walks of life. the end point takes a little skill to get off but nothing too bad to handle. again, we will be returning or recommending.
