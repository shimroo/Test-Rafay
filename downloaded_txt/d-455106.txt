savings through self-funding







self-funding saves, but how you self-fund also matters. maximizing value calls for the right administrator… and there’s a crucial distinction between aso organizations and the third party administration that allows medben to deliver real self-funded savings. 







administrative services only (aso) organizations are typically run by large insurance carriers who package their medical administration with other services operated by the same company… so if you’re “saving” money in one area, there’s a good chance you’re paying it back in another.





with medben third party administration (tpa), clients have the ability to select from different vendors who compete for their business. medben helps you build the best plan design and cost saving solutions… we help you choose the best option for you.

forensic claims review







good claims management takes more than just auto-adjudication and getting the payment out the door. real claims savings requires that you pay the right price only for the services necessary… and don’t get locked into contracts that prevent a thorough claims review. this is how medben forensic claims review delivers.







medben forensic claims review brings together skilled examiners, advanced algorithms, and medical specialists to detect and correct claim inconsistencies.





our forensic claims review means that you pay the right claim at the right price.







delivering…
alternative reimbursement strategies







self-funding offers employers  the flexibility and independence to better manage health care costs through alternative reimbursement strategies, like direct-to-employer contracting where health systems partner with health plans to lower cost and improve care… reference-based pricing that affords employers the opportunity to reimburse according to medicare pricing… and fair market reimbursement that combines the best of ppos and reference-based pricing.







medben clients who use alternative reimbursement strategies spend on average 19.6% less than traditional ppo plans alone.





45% of medben clients now use alternative reimbursement strategies in their plan design.







delivering…









 transparency is important in the pharmacy benefits world – there are too many games and hidden costs. but to save money you also need an independent pharmacy benefits manager that passes through all savings and 100% of paid rebates. this is rare in a world where health insurance companies use pbms as another profit line. but it is where medben rx delivers.







medben rx clients spend on average 18.1% less than other pbms.





82% of medben clients currently use medben rx.

managing a health plan requires  insight. insight for health plans requires information combined with a deep understanding of employee benefits. this is where medben analytics delivers for our clients.







medben analytics offers actionable reports that show you what is working with your plan while highlighting areas of potential improvement… and greater savings. 





medben analytics’ benchmarking capabilities enable you to compare your data against and national norms and/or specific industries. you can also narrow your reporting by plan type, number of lives and other metrics to get a true measure of how your plan stacks up.







delivering…









it makes sense. structure a wellness/disease management program that encourages members to get preventive screenings from physicians in order to identify and manage chronic and potentially catastrophic conditions early, and you will improve plan performance and employee health. wellness saves and medben wellliving delivers.







through early detection and prevention of chronic conditions, medben wellliving clients spend an average of 6.3% less compared to those who don’t use wellliving.





medben wellliving clients spend less per member on all major chronic conditions.





42% of medben clients currently use medben wellliving.

medical solutions.medben will work with your clients to find the best solution to meet specific employee population needs. increasingly, organizations are going outside the ppo box and turning to direct-to-employer contracting, reference-based pricing, and other alternative reimbursement strategies with set pricing that makes it easier to predict expenses. and their members can visit the doctors they prefer and still realize lower out-of-pocket costs.

pharmacy solutions.medben rx follows a simple philosophy: the client's money belongs to the client. our pharmacy solutions are designed to get members the right drug at the lowest cost, with total transparency to the employer. these include:


pricing solutions that ensure clients pay just what the pharmacies pay.
appropriateness solutions to find the most effective drugs at the best cost.
access solutions that give members new ways to lower their drug cost.














direct-to-employer contracting
many medben clients blend their rbp plan with direct-to-employer (dte) contracts, which promote the use of quality care through local providers. in exchange for encouraging members to visit contracted facilities, providers bill the plan at mutually agreed-upon rates.
medben has been facilitating dte contracting for over a decade with doctors and hospitals across the midwest, and we continue to gain access to more exclusive dte contracting. this strategy ensures that when members utilize area providers, they receive the best pricing options available.
