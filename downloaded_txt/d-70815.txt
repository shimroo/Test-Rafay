i feel like i was led here
nothing happens by coincidence and odds are you stumbled onto this site (me) for a reason. you have to ask yourself what "is" that reason? are you here because you are interested in a reading? do you feel like someone on the other-side is connecting with you? if so click here
maybe you are here because you are on a spiritual path and want to learn more about the psychic world, or how you can use metaphysical tools to make some positive changes in your life…today! click here
if you have absolutely no clue who the heck i am, or what i do… but you some how found yourself here – i am a psychic medium – work with energy – talk to dead people – (yes… for real) and i would say sign up for the newsletter to learn more about this world via your inbox when my newsletter goes out (which is totally free) click here

i want to learn more
great!
my favorite thing to do is to raise awareness so people like you can put it into everyday action. i don’t think a private reading is what you need – you might want to join the evolve community. it is a great way for people to jump in and connect not only with me, but with other like-minded folks from all around the world. there’s too many benefits to list being an evolve member here – but click here and you might be one of the five people who win a private reading each month just because they are evolvers (that’s what the community has nicknamed each other)!

i'm curious
curiosity means that you are "feeling" or being pulled to experience something more in your life than you can consciously define. did you ever think that you had spirit guides? a team of energies that are working with you to help you navigate this lifetime? maybe you are feeling you need guidance because you are at a crossroads? maybe you just realized "hey! that’s the guy from crossing over??!?" and you want to watch him live…
if you are interested in a private reading: click here
if you are interested in a reading, but don’t want to quite do a private session whether it be for cost or you don’t know what to expect – attend a group event. click here
if you want to learn and expand your understanding of the world of energy - click here for the free email newsletter
