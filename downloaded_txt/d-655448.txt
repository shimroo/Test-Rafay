i have not forgotten about my little blog...





while i have been absent, i have not been idle.  i have been, to my delight, able to maintain a certain intensity in the routine of my life.  while cuckolding is not a day in and day out part of my life with my husband, loving female authority certainly is.  my husband and i are experimenting with sensory deprivation and hypnosis to attempt to reach new levels of intimacy in this dynamic.  with such a willing subject, i believe i am so far effective, but really, how do i know for certain.  he is so compliant without any of the ritual and drama of these new experiments.

10th installment





i was brought out of the room, and put into a chastity device before being locked unceremoniously into a steel cage where i spent the rest of the night.  outside, i could hear the three of them fucking, screaming, and ultimately laughing and talking quietly.  kay was not part of their inter-circle,not one of them so to speak, but she was much more privileged in this group than i was.  i contemplated my new existence as i drifted off to sleep.i was awoken fairly early.  ryan had gotten up to pee, and came in to get me up so that i could go out and buy the groceries i would need to prepare them all breakfast.  he let me out of the cage, but kept the chastity device on me.  “hurry back, and make sure the bacon isn’t too crisp,” said ryan. when i returned from the grocery store, i could hear them up and talking quietly from the bedroom.  soon, the talk evolved into sex, and i could hear soft moans coming from both of the women.  breakfast was nearly ready when i heard my wife call to me.  “jay, come in here.  i’ve got something for you.”  i scurried into the bedroom and saw kay positioned in the middle of ryan and suzanne.  they were all naked and looked unbelievably beautiful together like that.  “right here, jay, right between kay’s legs,” ordered suzanne.  i nestled into position with my head at kay’s pussy.  she held her legs tightly together.  “open your legs up, dear,” she said to kay.  kay spread her legs and i could see now why i was called into the room.  ryan’s semen was spilling out of my wife.without a word being spoken, i put my mouth to her pussy.  i felt her hand touch the back of my head and pull me in closer.  “good boy,” she said.  “you surprise me, honey.  i didn’t know you had this in you.”  she purred as suzanne leaned in to kiss her.“that’s enough,” said ryan.  “you’ve had your breakfast, now go get ours ready.”i scurried out of the bedroom and back to the kitchen.  there was work to be done.*** chapter 5 ***i was sent home late that morning and was told that kay would be dropped off at the house by 5:00.  i was to have the entire house cleaned from top to bottom and the laundry washed, ironed and put away.  my wife, i was informed, had some training of her own to undergo, and that when she returned home, it would be my turn to get an “expectation setting” conversation.i worked like mad to get the house clean.  i was just putting up the last of the laundry when kay walked in the house shortly after 5:30.  “meet me in the guest room in fifteen minutes.  bring wine and one glass.”  she stepped into the master (ironic word) bathroom and shut the door behind her.fifteen minutes later, i was kneeling in front of the wingback chair in the guest room waiting for my wife to arrive.  i wore only the chastity device that i had been wearing since last night. she stepped into the room wearing only a short, white robe.  she took a seat in the chair, and extended her hands to take the glass of wine from me.  “i guess we didn’t know what we were each capable of becoming,” she said in a whispered voice.  she smiled and sipped on the wine.  “and i still think we can become so much more.  don’t you agree?”“yes,” i replied.“first, let me tell you that i now know everything.  i know how you responded to suzanne’s ad for a professional mistress.  i know how you became a whore to both of them while i sat home, feeling lonely and ignored.  i know how you set me up to be seduced by ryan… how you were so willing to have him fuck me.”  in truth, i wondered if she did know everything.  did she know, for example, she was on camera when ryan was fucking her on the massage table?  at this point, however, did it really matter?“i’m sorry,” i muttered.“don’t be.  it’s all working out perfectly as far as i’m concerned.  i like our new arrangement very much.  i think you do as well, am i right?”“yes, i confess.  i do like it.  i don’t understand it, but i love it.”“it’s ok, honey.  i’m here to make this dream a reality for you.  you will become my perfect, submissive cuckold in every way.  you’ll wear that chastity device on your pathetic cock all the time.  i’ll expect that you obey me perfectly, and that you do things that you know please me on your own initiative.  ryan will fuck me when it pleases him.  you may or may not be involved.  he also thinks that i should recruit a small group of lovers other than him.  he thinks they should be men that you and i both already know.  any suggestions?”“no, i’m sorry, i don’t.  i....”kay interrupted me.  “don’t worry.  i have some ideas.  for example, i’ve never told you this, but jack hanover has been flirting with me for years.  he called me after you fired him.  he said that while you two would obviously never be friends again, he wanted me to know that if there was ever anything i needed, to please call him.  i never called him, but i have masturbated to the thought of being fucked by that man a hundred times.  he’s still single;  i checked.”“honey, he’s still friends with chuck (my rival at work).  he would tell chuck and everyone at my company would know.”“would know what, jay?  would know that he fucked me, or that not only he fucked me, but that you are also a submissive cuckold… a man that likes to watch his wife be fucked by other men.  which did you mean, jay?”“either would be bad,” i said.“well, maybe i’ll just keep you in the closet while jack fucks me.  maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if your rival knew he was only fucking me and not the whole truth.  but when he leaves… when he goes home… you’ll be out of the closet and then you know what happens.  right, jay.”“what’s that?”kay leaned back and opened up her robe.  she put one leg over the arms of the chair and the other over my shoulder.  “ryan fucked me hard right before i left.”  her pussy exposed, i could see that it was still red and swollen from the sex.  it was barely dripping ryan’s semen.  i put my mouth to her crotch and licked hungrily.  “there you go.  i know you love doing this.  you’ll really love doing it when its jack’s cum, won’t you?”“anything for you, dear.”“and suzanne, she promised to teach me how to keep you in line.  she’s says there are lots of wonderful ways to remind you who’s in charge around here.  i’ll be getting some of my own equipment… strap-ons, paddles, cuffs.  and you’ll be doing a lot of housework.  when you are not at work, and not traveling, you’ll be home, cooking, cleaning, and doing everything you took for granted from me for years.  and i may be here… or maybe not.  i might be called over by suzanne or ryan, so lick them, suck them or fuck them… whatever they want.”  i bowed my head in resignation of what awaited me.“but don’t worry, dear.  i really do love.  i really do care for you.  you know this don’t you?”“yes, of course,” i responded.  “my eyes have been opened to what it is that you need.  i never appreciated how fundamental submission was to who you are.  i knew you had asked me to play “games” with you before... tying you up, that sort of thing.  i just never knew that this was just the tip of the iceberg.  i never understood how deeply you craved complete submission.  does this all resonate with you?”“yes, it does.”  i was not telling her what she wanted to hear.  this was the truth.“tell me.  i want to hear it from you.”“i’ve never been able to escape the fact,” i started to respond, “that i knew i could be closer with you if i were to submit to you.  i am so sorry that i went behind your back to tried and fulfill these urges to submit, but they were so strong.  i am so sorry i pulled you into this the way i did.  i love you so much”“don’t worry, baby,” she assured me.  “i’ am going to take good care of you.  i love you more than ever.  this is all for the best.”  she pulled me back into her pussy.  i started to service her again, but she stopped me. “don’t kiss it, just be close to me…  just breathe.”  i lay against her with tears forming in my eyes.  “i love you so much.”“no more talking, just breathe.”

9th installment





we met all met at a latin club where they serve dinner around the perimeter of a large dance floor.  this was in an odd part of town, and i bet that we were one of the few couples in the club that were not speaking spanish that evening.  there was certainly nobody there that we knew.of course i pretended that i had never met suzanne, and that i had only briefly met ryan when i had bought the gift certificate.  there was dinner, and then dancing, and a polite request from ryan to bring kay onto the dance floor.  there was wine, and there were awkward but scripted moments, and soon we were back at suzanne and ryan’s home with even more wine.if i omit details, it is as much because i feel that they are not important as it is that i do not remember them.  i do remember thinking that it was clearly scripted on kay’s part when we were alone for a moment in their living room and she asked me if i minded her dancing with ryan.  “no,” i told her, giving her my own scripted responses, “actually, it really turned me on.”this comment lit a fire under my wife.  she kissed me like we were newlyweds again.  when suzanne and ryan returned to the room, i got up to use the restroom.  when i came back, the three of them were sitting together on the couch giggling like school kids.  “so, jay,” called ryan when i stepped into the room, “it turned you on when i was dancing with your wife?”  kay slapped at ryan’s chest teasingly.  she looked at me as if to apologize with her eyes.  “why,” he asked.  “why does it possibly turn you on?”this was not scripted, but it was my moment nonetheless.  “i’ve always had a fantasy of watching kay with another man,” i said.  kay’s jaw dropped.  i stood there silent and exposed.“what do you mean,” asked ryan.  “you’ve fantasized about watching another man dance with your wife… kiss her… fuck her?”  i stood silent and motionless.  “because if kay is game, i’d be up for it.  kay… would you like to kiss me?”“go ahead,” said suzanne, “it turns me on too.”  kay smiled, but did not move.  she looked to me for my response.“it’s ok, honey.  if you want to….”  she closed her eyes and moved her parted lips to ryan’s mouth.  there was a moment, a gentle coming together of these two lovers, and then stillness and silence.“stand,” commanded ryan.  i watched kay react to his words.  she stood, compelled to obey him.  “undress.”  kay looked back at me, not for approval, but only to gauge my reaction.  it was a forced, half smile.  it was not that i was upset… i was drifting into sub-space.  she lifted her shirt over head, not bothering to undo the buttons.  she stepped out of her shoes.  she let her skirt fall and stepped out of it as well.  she stood, her back to me, wearing black lace panties, garters and sheer stockings.  i had not seen her wear garters in ten years. “take off the panties, but leave the garters on,” commanded ryan.“you want to watch me fuck your wife?”  ryan’s eyes met mine, but kay’s remained with her back to me.  “yes,” i answered.  ryan stood and undid the buttons on his shirt, one by one.  he pulled his shoes off, removed his socks, and stood bare-chested in front of kay.  “kneel down,” he told her.  she obeyed and buried her face in his hard stomach, unable to wait to connect with his flesh.  “you, kneel also.”  he spoke to me as if my submission was a given.  it was; i knelt.kay moved to undo ryan’s belt, and was soon helping him step out of his pants.  had i not already known what was happening, kay would have betrayed the ruse as she started to kiss his cock with a practiced familiararity.  suzanne took a position behind me, and started unbuttoning my own shirt.  soon i was naked, all fours on the floor, staring at my wife deep-throating another man.  “you love this cock, don’t you, dear?" said ryan as he stroked her hair.  "you’ll do anything i ask of you.”i hadn’t noticed that suzanne had left the room, but she stepped back into it dressed only in a vinyl corset and a strap-on.  in a latex-gloved hand she held a bottle of lubrication, and in her other hand she held a collar and leash.  i lifted my neck to accept my collar, and then i felt her working my asshole with her finger and gloved hand.  the dildo on her strap-on was small, much smaller than what i had learned to take over the course of my time with her.suzanne was now positioned behind me, barely on the verge of entering me while she tugged on the leash just enough to keep my head up.  ryan took this as his cue.  he positioned kay on all fours facing me, my feminine mirror image.  as she had her back to me up until now, this was the first she saw of what i had become for suzanne, and her eyes opened wide… her surprise dissolving into a wicked smile.  in ryan’s hands appeared a collar and leash of his own.  he held it out in front of kay to see it. "are you ready for this he asked?"  she nodded in affirmative with her eyes still locked on me.  she took it from him, fumbling with it as her hands shook while putting it on her own neck.“crawl forward,” ordered suzanne.  “close enough to kiss your wife, but don’t touch her yet.”ryan looked at suzanne and nodded his head.  instantly i felt her vinyl dildo push inside of me.  at the same moment, i saw kay’s mouth widen, her eyes shut, and i saw ryan’s neck tighten.  he was inside of her, fucking my wife like his whore.  “kiss each other,” commanded ryan.  “you belong to us now, the games are all behind us.”  our leashes were kept tight enough to remind us of our positions as my wife and i kissed each other with a new passion and abandon.  i could feel ryan’s thrusts into kay like the reverberations of a bass drum, and suzanne matched them beat for beat with her own strokes into me.   “is this what you want,” i whispered to kay.“more than anything,” she answered.  it was over.

eighth installment





i'd love to finish this story in elise sutton's pre-dominant newsletter... thoughts?***************after i left ryan and suzanne, i did not even go back to my office.  i went straight to the airport where i would have to catch a flight that would have me out of town for the entire week.  on the ride to the airport, i was trying to make sense of what was happening to me.  there was no doubt that i was pursuing behavior that gave me a powerful sense of macabre satisfaction, something that filled a need and satisfied a craving that to anyone else would seem completely irrational.  it seemed that in pursuing this need i was sacrificing everything that had ever mattered to me in my life.  the only term that came to my mind for this irrational behavior on my part was addiction.  cuckolding was my heroin, my junk, the thing that occupied my thoughts and moved me towards what seemed like a life very different than the comfortable one that i had lived up to now.  i was trading it all for the overwhelming sense of indisputable and perfect knowledge that my submission was complete.  i would be balled up in a corner, my mind warmed by submission but my soul cold and shaking from what i had sacrificed.i called kay that evening, just to check in, realizing that she had no idea that i had witnessed her affair with ryan.  she was a little cold and distant, and indicated that her day was uneventful.  i told her i loved her and let her know i was missing her already.  there was a pause before she told me she loved me as well.  her tone was very convincing.  i thought maybe i could stop everything in its tracks if i just acted quickly to reconnect with her.little did i know that even as i was speaking to her, she was in the bathroom readying herself for an evening with ryan.  she met him out at a restaurant frequented by people much younger that ourselves, and in a trendy but out of the way part of town.  there was very little risk that they would have run into someone we know… unless of course, it was engineered.when suzanne walked into the restaurant, ryan acted as though it were a complete surprise.  “wow, suzanne… there’s someone i want you to meet.  this is kay, she and i work out together.  kay, this is suzanne… my roommate.”“roommate,” remarked kay, raising her eyebrows in surprise.“oh, don’t worry… there’s a long way between roommate and girlfriend,” answered suzanne.“who are you meeting here,” asked ryan.“actually… you, ryan.  i left my keys in my briefcase which is sitting in the back of meg’s car.  you had mentioned you had the reservations, so i just swung by to see if i could borrow yours.  i’ll be home, and i’ll just leave the door open.”“that’s no problem,” said ryan, “but why don’t you join us for at least a glass of wine.  i mean, you drove all this way.  kay… is that ok with you?”“sure, why not,” said kay.suzanne ended up staying through most of the dinner.  kay played right into their plans as the two women hit it off marvelously. after suzanne left ryan and kay at the restaurant to finish their desert without her, kay rambled on about how sweet suzanne was as ryan continued to refill her wine and continued to pour on the charm.  kay was becoming putty in their hands.when kay and ryan finally got home, suzanne was already sitting in front of the couch watching tv in very dim light, easily unnoticed.  the two lovers opened the front door and pushed their way into the foyer, mouths locked and hands exploring each other with a sense of hurried anticipation.  kay was drunk, and ryan intentionally kept her back to suzanne as he lifted her into the den. then he positioned her down on the couch so that suzanne was still not in plane sight.  suzanne remained in the shadows, sitting motionless and still… wearing a tight-fitting woman’s t-shirt and panties, drinking white wine.it appeared that kay was not aware that suzanne was in the room.  her eyes were half closed as ryan managed to get her dress off and lay her down with her back on the couch.  he pulled off his own pants and straddled her chest, reaching back behind him to play gently with kay’s pussy with one hand while positioning his cock in her mouth with the other.  kay was distracted by her hunger to taste and satisfy ryan.  she didn’t notice when the strong hand between her legs was replaced by a softer, gentler hand.  and if she even noticed when that hand became a warm mouth, she said nothing. as kay’s hips started to gyrate, ryan and suzanne knew that they would soon have her.  suzanne let the pace of her tongue become more rapid.  ryan shifted so that one foot was on the floor and one knee was on the couch, his cock remaining in kay’s mouth the entire time.  the result of ryan’s shifting himself on the couch was that his body no longer blocked kay’s view of suzanne.  kay’s eyes opened and fixed on the beautiful blonde woman between her legs.  a woman was eating her pussy for the first time in her life. she embraced the moment, and her fingers found their way to the back of suzanne’s head.  she ran them through the fine, straight hair and moaned softly.with this ryan pulled his cock out of kay’s mouth and lifted her up into his arms.  suzanne stood and removed her own shirt and panties.  she followed ryan into their bedroom.  he was laying kay straight out on the bed on her stomach.  suzanne moved around to the front of the bed, propping herself up against some pillows so that her open legs came together to give kay her first taste of pussy.  ryan lifted kay’s hips slightly. he positioned the head of his cock at the precipice of kay’s warm opening, but waited until he saw her lips touch suzanne’s pussy before pushing inside of her.  suzanne stroked kay’s hair as ryan fucked her with only his own pleasure in mind.  this was only the beginning of my wife’s seduction, but as it continued, kay’s pleasure would become less and less consequential to ryan and suzanne.  ironically, their indifference would only serve to heighten kay’s pleasure.despite the distraction of ryan’s hard, thrusting cock, kay proved to be very adept at licking suzanne’s pussy.  suzanne later told me that kay was a natural, and wasn’t content to just go through the motions.  she was ravenous, exploring every corner of suzanne’s crotch, inhaling deeply as if the aroma intoxicated her as it also did me.after ryan released his seed in kay, he got up and left the room to clean up, leaving the two women to cuddle in each other’s arms and kiss and neck like new lovers often do.  suzanne let her hand find kay’s pussy, and put her finger inside to drench it in ryan’s cum.  she put it inside my wife’s mouth and she nursed it like a hungry kitten.“do you like losing your inhibitions with us?” asked suzanne.“yes,” nodded kay.“i seem to sense that you might have a submissive side,” remarked suzanne.“maybe,” responded kay.“we’ll see,” said suzanne as the two drifted off to sleep, still embracing each other.suzanne was gone the next morning when kay woke up, but ryan had crawled back into bed in the middle of the night.  he had made kay breakfast, and they drank a cup of coffee together making comfortable small talk until kay left shortly thereafter.“you’ll be back tonight, right?” asked ryan. “i mean, you said your husband would be gone all week.”“if you’ll have me,” smiled kay.“oh, we’ll have you,” replied ryan with his own smile beaming from ear to ear.***when kay returned that night, it was ryan’s turn to have slipped away.  suzanne greeted kay at the door with a kiss on the cheek and told her that ryan had gone to buy some wine, but he would be back soon.“i wish i’d known,” said kay, flashing two bottles of wine that she had brought.suzanne smiled and walked kay into the kitchen to grab a bottle opener.  she handed it to kay and kay worked on the cork, pulling it and filling three glasses that suzanne placed on the counter.  she leaned forward and kissed kay before handing her a glass.  kay was smitten.“so you had fun last night?” asked suzanne.“absolutely, i feel like i’m letting myself go for the very first time.  my husband and i have drifted so far apart that there’s no intimacy anymore.  i wish that wasn’t so, but it is.  last night i feel like i made up for lost time.”“we loved it too.  we talked about it all day.  ryan and i think we can have something really special with you, but you just have to trust us.”“what do you mean?” asked kay.“oh, i’ll explain later.  just tell me about your day.  the two women drifted off into small talk and munched on some cheese and crackers that suzanne put on a plate for them.  soon, however, suzanne’s cell phone rang and interrupted them.“it’s ryan,” she said looking at the caller id.  “no, i haven’t said anything about it yet.  yes, i promise i will.  hurry back.”“said anything about what?” asked kay.“well, we have this little fantasy… do you think you’d be up for something a bit kinky?”“well,” answered kay with a smile, “by my standards i’ve already been up to something kinky.  what do you have in mind?”“ryan and i were thinking,” she bit her lip and cocked her head just a bit, “that it might be fun tonight if you were our little sex slave.  we wouldn’t do anything that made you uncomfortable, just a little harmless role playing.  what do you think?”kay rubbed her finger around the rim of her wine glass.  she put the glass to her mouth, closed her eyes, and emptied it before setting it back down on the calendar.  “your wish is my command,” she said with a smile.“perfect,” responded suzanne.  she filled kay’s glass and instructed her to wait in the living room while she grabbed a few ‘things’.  she unlocked the door to her chambers and went inside, closing and locking the door behind her.  when she stepped out ten minutes later, she was dressed to the nines.  from the leather tips of her thigh-high boots, to the top laces of her leather corset, she was in amazing form.  in her right hand she held a collar and a leash.  as she walked into the living room kay started to stand.  “sit back down,” ordered suzanne.  she extended her gloved hand to kay’s mouth, and kay put her tongue to work licking the tips of suzanne’s fingers.kay was made to strip and kneel in front of suzanne.  “i’m not going to put this collar on you, not yet anyway.”  she held the collar in front of kay.  “if you really want to belong to us, you’ll put it on yourself.  but we’ll explain all this to you later.  although… i bet right now you’re thinking you want to belong to us, don’t you?” she pulled kay’s mouth to her waist.  “kiss your mistress’s pussy.”  kay’s lips touched suzanne’s body.  she closed her eyes and lost herself in her submissive passions.“save some of that energy for me, pet.”  it was ryan.  he had slipped quietly back into the house from the garage and standing naked beside suzanne.  he leaned down on one knee and kissed kay softly on the side of her mouth.  she tried to make more of the kiss, but that was all he offered.  ryan took a seat on the couch across the room.  “come here, pet.”  kay stood to walk to ryan.  “no, no… crawl.”  kay dropped back to her knees and crawled to her new master.  ryan spread his legs slightly.  “suck on my cock… that’s a good girl.”suzanne was now standing behind kay.  she had pulled on her strap-on, but in her hand she held a very small vibrator.  she placed it against kay’s pussy, and kay turned to see what was happening.  “no, no,” said ryan.  “eyes on me.”    the combination of her first foray into submission, and the pulsating vibrations that suzanne was working between her legs was intoxicating kay.  she wanted only to satisfy ryan, and he was coaching her to fight her gag reflex and to take his cock into the back of her throat.  he stopped he as he got close to cumming, and had her lick his balls and place only soft, gentle kisses on the length of his cock.  “what do you think your husband would think of this?” asked ryan.  kay paused to look up at ryan.  “i think he couldn’t imagine this.  he’s very sexually… dull... i guess that’s the word  he wouldn’t think i have this in me.”“call me ‘sir’ when you speak to me, ok, kay.  call me ‘sir’ and suzanne “ma’am”.”“yes, sir,” responded kay.  she went back to kissing ryan’s balls.“many men,” said suzanne from behind her, “get very turned on by watching their wife act like such a slut.  i bet your husband would like to watch you suck ryan’s cock like you do.  do you know what it’s called when a husband likes to watch his wife get fucked by another man?”  kay shook her head.  “it makes him a ‘cuckold’.  it makes him a submissive, cuckold.  the woman not only ends up fucking whoever she wants, she ends up with a husband that does whatever she tells him to do. do you think that maybe your husband would want to be a cuckold?”kay stopped suddenly and looked at them both very seriously.  “why the interest in my husband all of a sudden?”  “sir.  refer to me as sir.”“yes, sir.  sorry, sir.  why the sudden interest in my husband, sir.”“because you cannot wear that collar… you cannot really belong to us as long as we are a secret from him.  we don’t want to share you, we want to own you.”suzanne, who has been running the vibrator she held against kay on a very slow speed, suddenly turned it up.  then she positioned the head of her strap-on against the moistening lips of kay’s pussy.  kay closed her eyes and caught her breath.  the pleasure was catching up to her.  suzanne pushed herself inside of kay and leaned in to whisper in her ear.  “you want to belong to us, don’t you?”“tell you husband that you’ve arranged to go out to dinner with your new trainer and his girlfriend on saturday night.  we’ll take it from there,” commanded ryan.“yes, sir.”  these were the last words she muttered before abandoning her body to the pure sexual pleasure of sucking ryan’s cock and being fucked by suzanne’s strap-on.saturday would be here before she knew it.

loving female authority



the purpose of this blog is to share my very deeply held views on the subject of wife-led households.  a wife-led, or female-led, houseold is one where husbands submit to the loving female authority of their wives.

in creating this blog, i feel like i stand on the shoulders of giants.  elise sutton, emily addison and lady misato have all made great contributions to thinking in this space.  i hope my own ideas can carry on in the thoughtful tradition of these women.
