old edgefield district genealogical society
 






















welcome to the old edgefield district genealogical society






  the purpose of old edgefield district genealogical society (oedgs) is to promote genealogical and historical research in old edgefield district. oedgs was headquartered in the tompkins memorial library buildings, in the town of edgefield, for almost forty years. the facilities were wonderful and provided an ideal climate for our many members and guests to visit and research our extensive collections. however, oedgs has moved its library to a new location, in the town of johnston (still in edgefield county).   on this note, oedgs is the largest genealogical society in the state of south carolina with over 400 members across 40 states, and in england. oedgs’ library collection encompasses over 5,500 historical and genealogical books, approximately 2,500 surname files, 2,000 subject files, hundreds of reels of microfilm, a digital archive, a large selection of african-american and native american genealogical resources, and is constantly adding to its library collection.  there is an extensive collection of family histories as well, with new titles being acquired regularly. many of these histories were donated by the authors or by family members. the society welcomes additional material from members and researchers to add to these collections.   we are so grateful and excited that we are finally establishing our genealogical library in the building that the town of johnston renovated for us. the facility is incredible and with our volunteers, who are the very soul of the library, we are creating a place that will last for generations to come. our grand opening will be held on sunday, march 9th, at 3:00 p. m.   please contact us by email at oedgs85@gmail.com or phone at 803-336-9292 if you have any questions or concerns.    oedgs is a non-profit organization supported by memberships, donations, and sale of publications. [the internal revenue code, section 501 (3) allows tax deductions for the value of materials donated to the chapter.]
