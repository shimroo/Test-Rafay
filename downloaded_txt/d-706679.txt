about the website


the isle of tiree genealogy website was set up in 2005 by keith dash, a descendant of john macdonald of balinoe, tiree, who emigrated with his family to australia in 1853.  the website was an outgrowth of the former rootsweb sct-arl-tiree mailing list, established in 1998, that put descendants of tirisdeach (persons of tiree) around the world in touch with one another. we soon realized that we needed something in addition to the mailing list where our genealogy and history research could be stored and made available to everyone, whether inside or outside our mailing list group. a website was the answer. subscribers to the mailing list were the foundation contributors to the website and set it on its way. the website is privately funded and there are no fees or charges to access the material on it.  all the material is contributed by people who give their time and expertise freely in the interests of genealogical research.

tiree





tiree, the most westerly island of the inner hebrides group off the west coast of mainland scotland, is small and flat, about 20km long and 2-12km wide, and almost treeless.there is evidence of stone age and iron age settlements, and celtic and viking occupations. viking influence lasted until the mid 1200s, and many norse place names still survive on the island. after the defeat of the vikings, the island again came under the control of gaelic-speaking peoples, at first the macdougalls, then the macdonald lords of the isles, and then the macleans. there were conflicts between the macleans and the mainland campbells, and in the 1600s the maclean estates in tiree and mull were taken over by archibald campbell, earl of argyll. tiree has remained under the ownership of the campbells, dukes of argyll, since that time. the gaelic language has survived in tiree, as have the gaelic traditions of song, poetry and storytelling. over 40% of present-day islanders are fluent speakers of gaelic and it is taught to children as a second language in the island's schools.  the island's population peaked at about 5,000 in the 1800s and today is about 700.  the early islanders survived by farming and fishing, but at little more than subsistence level.  for centuries tiree had been a grain producing island, but from the 1700s onwards the islanders began to rely more on potatoes than on cereal meal as a staple food.  with the outbreak of potato blight in the late 1840s, which devastated crops in scotland as well as in ireland, the people of tiree experienced a number of years of severe famine.





even before the famine years of 1846-1854 tiree had become seriously overpopulated.  the population had increased from 1,500 in 1750 to almost 5,000 in 1840, by which time many island people were living in severe poverty.  the 8th duke of argyll, when he succeeded to the estate in 1847, wrote that tiree had "a vast semi-pauper population".  he became an enthusiastic advocate of assisted emigration to relieve the situation.  from 1847 to 1853, 1,354 tiree people were assisted to emigrate, principally to canada, and an unknown number of others left for the mainland.  it was claimed that this was "a purely voluntary emigration", but there is evidence that the poorest people were targeted by persuasion or coercion.  summonses of removal were issued against 174 tenants on the island and others were "warned" of removal.  between 1847 and 1861, the number of small tenancies, those paying an annual rent of less than £5, declined from 242 to 52.  the duke's tiree estate manager, or factor, was colonel john campbell, known on the island as the 'big factor' or the 'black factor'.  he was energetic in implementing the duke's policy of raising rents, evicting those in arrears, and arranging assisted passages to overseas countries.  the houses of evicted families were burned, and islanders caught giving shelter to these people risked being evicted themselves.  you can find the ruins of their houses, now just piles of stones overgrown with grass, in the fields around the present-day townships.

today the population of tiree is about 700, but there is a much larger community of many thousands of people scattered around the world, mainly in canada, australia or new zealand, who are descendants of tiree emigrants.  our ancestors may have been coerced to emigrate, in their new homelands they may have been called 'primitive' because they spoke gaelic as their first language and were not proficient in written english, but they and their children were the builders of new nations.
