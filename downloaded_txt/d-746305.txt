good day, thank you very much for your answer. i fixed everything. i assembled the antenna according to code 2.

the antenna is very old, i have second hands,  the previous owner replaced the crossbar with a steel one. it fell and broke.  some elements were bent, i straightened them a little. the traps are in excellent condition.

i opened everything and looked, everything was fine, there were only some shavings.

i am very pleased with the antenna.

thought you might like to see this. we recently had the remains of hurricane beryl go through central new york. they clock wind gusts  of up to 80mph.

the tree is 20 feet away from the tower.  we lost power on are road for 27 hours with power lines and poles blown down. a golf course near us had 65 trees down. as you already know, i recently rebuilt this 30 + year old antenna. it still stands in tact with the us tower.

thought its about time i send  you a letter about your products. i purchased a ta-33-m from a private individual here in florida where we have wind storms, salt air, you name it, we have it. i got the antenna home and cleaned it up and ordered new parts from you for mounting.

the ta-33-m is replacing a beam from another manufacturer that left a lot to be desired. your beam is fantastic, i run only cw and barefoot and usually run 5w. even with 5w, if i hear them, i can work them. the ta-33-m is a work horse, built extremely rugged and im expecting it to last for years to come, even down here in hurricane alley.

thanks again for a great product and im in the process of ordering your ta-40-kr 4m add on.

thanks again:

ta-33-jr

subject: my ta-33jr from 1971


hiya, folks. i just looked to see if your firm was still around after all these years. i was delighted to see you are!

the only yagi i've ever owned was a ta-33jr. back when i'd just upgraded to general, as wb2nbs in 1968, my parents gifted me a heathkit sb-102 for high school graduation. that rig replaced an aging knightkit t-150a (better known as the tvi-150 for good reason.) 

after several months of cooking my lips on the mic  when using a 130-ft end fed zepp (without any rf ground) i went looking for a "real" antenna. leo cuniff w2oeh, of beckman instruments fame, (sk) was my neighbor & elmer. he said, "you can never go wrong with mosley."  

i bought one at the next hamfest. it spent four years strapped to a brick chimney on the family home.  at the time i had no idea what an swr bridge was, so i just assembled it by color codes and a tape measure. 

performance was astounding. on a path from 2-land to alaska, just a few degrees change would give me a sharp peak on received signals. and i could easily null out qrm as long as it wasn't on the exact same heading. four years later when i drove up to fairbanks. alaska, it rode on top of my vw minibus, taped into a slim bundle alongside my a 50 foot push-up pole.

it stayed with me over 40 years, and never failed to delight me when i was staying someplace long enough to put it up. 

i gave it to a newly-minted ham in 2009 when i was living in an apartment and he was in a house.

now that i'm retired and living in a house, i wish i had a mosely beam again. i am blessed with an xyl who recognizes the joy i get when i snag some rare (for me) dx using my homebrew fan dipole. but it's pretty hard to rotate the trees in my backyard.

 owning this antenna is almost like cheating!!   i love it!

anyway, our strong winds are usually from the west, what is the best direction to park it?

hello melissa. after several delays, i was able to, finally, assemble the ta54 xln 6 with the kr-30 kit added to it. firstly, i want to congratulate and thank the entire team at mosley for a product of the highest quality. the workmanship and its precision is impressive. the set of instructions for, both the antenna and the kit, are simple and straightforward. i followed them, religiously, and when the ta54 was installed on the tower, the swr readings on all bands were almost identical to those in your booklet. on april 17, with the tower fully retracted and the antenna at 25 feet above ground, my first qso was with s01ws, on my first call in a huge pile-up. the antenna is currently at 45 feet and i have worked all continents, except antarctica. i am very happy with the performance of the antenna on all bands (6m has been closed, lately) and i am so proud to be the owner of a mosley electronics product.

please, do make sure everyone involved know how much i appreciate their work. 73.

i bought a second hand pro 57a and removed it from a fellow moving to an hoa back in 1998 on new years day,  in windy, deerfield, illinois. after getting it down, and packing it up, it was time to move it to my home qth of montague, michigan. once it was home, the following spring i did a survey of what parts might be needed to restore this huge antenna to new condition and mosley customer service was kind, and professional in every aspect. with a few ordered parts, and some patience in tuning the array, it was ready for the tower.

its been up since 1999, and performs as well as it did the day i put it up! penetrox or other conductive grease is a must for rebuilding these, so dont leave it out!

the mosley company builds antennas for your heirs!

hi,
i have a mosley ta-33 sr for my primary hf antenna.  i acquired this antenna used probably about 20-25 years ago and it is still going strong.  in 2014, my location was experiencing a high wind event (sustained winds 40+mph).  my tower blew over and it bent the reflector element on my antenna.  a friend of mine gave me a replacement element which i installed and the antenna continues to perform well to this day.  i did not replace the tower but did install the antenna and rotor on a heavy pipe strapped to my chimney.  i have been licensed for 46 years and qrp operation has recently re-sparked my interest in hf.  i am using a small 5 watt xiegu g1m transceiver for ssb communications. with band conditions constantly improving, i am consistently receiving excellent signal reports, with some operators expressing surprise that i am only using 5 watts of power.  often times, they ask what type of antenna i am using.  when i tell them the antenna is a mosley ta33 the operators will compliment the antenna.  recently i worked a bermuda station who had a huge pileup on his signal.  i was able to break through the pileup and received a 59 signal report from the bermuda station who also happened to be using a ta33 as well.

the mosley ta33 is built like a tank.

hello, i have been a user of mosley ham radio antennas since 1989, having a ta36 classic, one of those very large ones, which unfortunately i lost, to be prudent in a change of address.

for today, and since 2013 i bought them a ta-33 mwarc with a 40m band. and it has worked very well for me.

very happy with your contribution to my hobby to date; i already have to do some replacement of the insulators, which is normal due to the long exposure to solar irradiation conditions and the dryness with which this area of the southern hemisphere in chile has had for 13 years to date, something similar to that in the south of california, since we are in the same parallel (33 degrees south approximately).

thank you mosley, greetings to all your workers.

well the good news is, i am able to use a external high power turner and 
tune it. before,i couldnt even do that. i am bringing in a lift and i have all new parts for the 2 driven elements. i am changing to the new phasing lines
that are pre-drilled with your new bolts and brilium washer etc. i just bought
new brown traps and i have red traps that i have taken apart and tested.

if i have to take all 8 traps a part and clean them i will with the lift. 
i can crank the tower to 23 feet and reach them all pretty easily i hope.
i will keep you informed so someone else doesnt have to go through this.

keep in mind, this has been up since 1993, and given me great service
and worked quite well for the 20 + years. it doesnt owe me anything. 
if all fails i will buy and put up something else.

mosley continues to impress!  not only has the antenna worked for an amazingly long time - but eight years ago we were able to get assistance and parts  - and you continue that legacy of service with your prompt support.

many thanks.

this is a great view in the morning. ta-63n with kr40 is up replacing my 50 + year old ta-33 that retired to a new to hf hams antenna farm. the ta-33 was purchased used 50 years ago and still works well. needed to add warc bands and replace tower so got new tower and beam and retired ta-33 to good home.

i havent had near the time i want to play with the ta-63n. what little time i  have had with it shows it to be great. love having 6 through 20 meters with gain and the rotatable dipole on 40 with just one feedline. great compliment to my hf  6 rig.

mosley ta32m - a2n6 - my430-14 antenna stack

subject: good to go!


i want to thank all of you at mosley for the great antennas and the help getting them set up! i have attached a picture of the top of my tower for you to see.

the 70 cm is at the top, 2 and 6 in the middle and of course the great ta-32m on the bottom. the hf is working perfectly with many overseas contacts in the last 30 hours the tower has been up. 

70cm, 2 meters and 6 meters work just as well. 

it took me working alone 60 days to lower the tower, replace all bolts (115 of them), build, test and mount the antennas and coax. it was a lot of work but worth it.

if you look closely at the picture, the 2 and 6 are a little offset from the other 2 antennas. my fault and it drives me crazy that i made that mistake. i will fix it in the fall. does not affect the operation though.

all swr readings are 1.4:1 or lower. 1.1:1 on hf.

thank you again and best regards!

another ta-33 still going!

sent: friday, may 20, 2022 11:12 am
subject: mosley ta 33 m

in the late fall of 2018 i was approached by a 90 + year older woman, the widow of a ham i knew only slightly.  she had a tower and antenna bracketed to her cottage  and was afraid it might fall during the winter. it had been three years since her late husband had done any maintenance on it and she was sure it needed work.  she just wanted it removed..

i went to look at it  the tower was a 60 +  foot crank up tower with a ta 33 m  at the top and several smaller uhf and vhf antennae mounted on the sides of the bottom section. her husband had homebrewed a tilt over base and wired the tower to the end of the ridge beam of the cottage at about 15 feet above ground..  there were no other lateral supports !   this was the only thing that kept it from tilting over.  i immediately reinforced that attachment.

she offered me $200.00 to get rid of "that thing "   i sensed that $200.00 was a big chunk of her budget so i offered to buy it for $200.00.  her eyes lit up.  i then explained that i would do the job when the weather broke in the spring. her tone changed and i sensed that the $200.00 was important to her so i said i would give her the $200.00 now, but take the tower down in the spring when the snow melted and it was more comfortable working outside. 

we had a deal.

this old lady had  a following of animals she fed.  a few deer, a few feral cats, and three very large turkey vultures who actually came when she called them.  as i learned later, they liked to perch on the large antenna.   when i lowered the antenna to the ground in the spring, i found claw marks all over it  and the end sections of the elements (stingers?) fell apart in my hands.  with the help of your customer service i was able to replace the sun damaged insulators and the end pieces of the elements.  the stainless steel hardware was as good as new.  the traps were in good shape and the heavier gauge sections of the elements cleaned up  well.  the rotarator needed work.  it and the tower have gone to my son.  the antenna sits on top of one of my other towers and works well.  my first contact with it was in eastern europe.  thanks to you policy of being able to supply parts for  even your oldest products, i have three mosely antennae with a combined age of at least 150 years.  they are all good as new.

dear mosley electronics ,
when i was a novice most of my elmers had a 3 band beam or quad and were working lots of dx!  i just had to get one of those when i became general and i did. the ta-33sr went to the top of my wishlist.
i bought the antenna and a 30 ft tower in 1970 and had many years of fun working dx, mainly the pacific & asia. when i moved from ca to ny the antenna was damaged in shipment. i needed help to identify the damaged traps and which part numbers to order.
i called mosley and mrs mosley took my call !  in no time i had a list of part numbers and instructions to make the repairs and most importantly how to reassemble everything properly.
i still have the antenna its been in storage for awhile as its too large for the size of my property maybe at my next qth !
thanks for making an antenna that  l a s t s .

i have a cl 33 that a fellow ham had in dalton ga and when he moved he needed the antenna removed from tower as he had sold the tower to another ham. i went over and removed the antenna from tower loaded it onto truck and delivered to my address in chatsworth. after 10 years of laying in back yard one winter i took it upon myself to tear it apart and clean and repair unit.

i took one arm at a time into my garage and disassembled cleaned and found broken coil form in 2 arms like it had been dropped on one side.  they were not destroyed but just broken. i cleaned and reassembled the units and stored them in safe location until i got all arms done. about 2 years later was able to get top section on 30 foot tower and old ham 4 rotor i rebuilt and have them together now for over a year. my first true use was during the annual 4th of july 13 colonies event where i was able to get for the first time all 13 colonies.

i love this old antenna and rotor they work great together. i could work europe easily on 20 meters and look forward to many more years of service.

i would like to submit the following testimonial to express my appreciation to mosley-electronics.

this week, i installed my mosley mp-33-nw (see picture attached). this is my 3rd mosley beam in 3 different locations; delaware, florida and michigan. in my opinion it is the finest quality beam on the market. it is constructed of excellent material and the color coding makes it easy to assemble. 

in addition to manufacturing a top quality product, the people at mosley are what make the difference. when you call, a real person answers the phone. there are no phone prompts to go through and wait time is minimal. the people are nice and knowledgeable. they always seem glad to answer my questions no matter how basic they are. i don't ever feel rushed when i call.  they are 100% professional. sometimes i have had to call back more than once but they don't ever seem to mind.

mosley is my antenna of choice which i highly recommend if quality and service are important to you.

thank you,

tim, 

i want to thank you for the excellent diagnostic when we spoke abt my s402  a couple of months ago.

i was finally able to take down the antenna and replace the insulators/standoffs.

i sent several pics so you can zoom in and see just how much material bubbled inside one of the insulators.

pretty amazing.

its all back together and will need to add  choke and so on before putting it back up. as it was the first time i put it up and tested it swr was flat at 7.050 10 ft off the ground.

the only comment is that the bottom #10 bolts that go into standoff/insulators  are abt ¼  shorter than originals, i called your office and spoke to one of your colleagues about that, he suggested i use the new parts.

again many thanks for all your help and support.

this past weekend, i finally was able to install the ta-40-kr that i
purchased around december 2020/january 2021 to my ta54-xln-6

primarily using the ft-8 mode and the signal reports vs the 43 foot vertical
were very nice.

i have attached a picture in case you would like to post in on your website.

good morning tim, 

some news about my ta-63n. 

we reassembled the antenna yesterday and changed the cable to rg213...and the verdict is out....

it was indeed at the level of the very low loss cable that the problem was...

the swr conforms to the specifications of the antenna. 1.1/1 to 1.2/1 in the middle of each band and even 1.0/1 on the 17m and does not vary with the power increase...which is normal. what a pleasure...

thank you very much for guiding me to the solution and your informed opinions. without you, i would probably have gone in circles because the very low loss cable had been tested several times without showing any problem. even with 1kw.

probably as you suggested, a micro break in the core that causes undetectable harmonics with my measuring equipment.

thanks again for the very good support. 

i had chosen mosley for its reputation both for the quality of its antennas and for the after sales support. 

i am not disappointed...mosley is true to its reputation.

i attach the picture of the antenna on the tower.

you can use it for your mosley web site if you want so as well as this email in whole or in part.

thanks again.

hi gary,

here i'm again :-)

many thanks for the spare-parts for the mosley mini-33a.

i did the cuttings already and the result was that i had to cut 5 cm at each side of the antenna, including the reflector and the director.

i installed the antenna with the coax balun and you can find the swr results in the table below.

for now i will stop with the antenna work because it gets colder and colder and not a good idea to climb on the tower anymore this year.

this was a test in ft8 ( beam in direction to the west) on saturday 17 october 2020 so the antenna is working!
 
i wish you a nice day and many thanks for your advises!

i look forward for your reply!

good morning melissa,

just wanted to send a quick note, that the ta-33jr showed up in excellent condition. 

looks like you folks been doing this for a while...
as i was an engineering technician with nasa for 36 years, i worked on many prototype designs and fabrication.

i was extremely happy with the fabrication, design and packing of such a fine antenna.

it went together with ease, with all parts marked and fit that was perfect...   just starting to play with it today and so far, looks to be more that i expected,  happy - happy - happy.....

i have just finished giving maintenance to a my 60 year old tribander, and once it was completely disasembled  all that was needed was cleaning the elements with soap and and wáter including the traps.

once it was assembled according to the original dimensions taking care to place the traps according to the instructions  and cleaning all the connections from the outlet of the radio to the the connection to the antenna the resulting swr readings with my mfj analyzer  the results were 10 m 1:1.2, 15 m 1: 1.2 20m 1:1.

the antenna is 122 feet above ground and all contacts from my shack to some south pacific islands including tasmania and new hebridis were above s9 with only 75 watts output .

obviously propagation helped a lot.
i am ok in qrz.com for some personal information and some pictures of my shack ans some equipment.

i purchase my mosley mp-33-n-warc with the 40-meter conversion kit on may 19, 2020 and it was delivered to my florida home on july 27, 2020 right on the schedule they gave me when i placed the order.  i purchased my first mosley antenna, a ta-33-jr.-n-w, on march 28,2012. i am getting ready to place an order for another mosley antenna for my summer home in harbor springs, mi.

i am a loyal mosley customer because i trust them and the consistency of their products. the quality of their products is excellent. a few days ago, i completed assembling my mosley mp-33. i dreaded opening the carton and putting it together. much to my surprise, the assembly was so easy thanks to their color coding. i am not a very technical operator and i anticipated issues. i was worried about nothing because i had no issues. it went together so fast i couldnt believe it.

the other thing i want to comment on is their people. when i call mosley, i get a real person within a couple of rings. no hold time; no waiting. the mosley team are all very nice and patient when answering my questions. i have never felt they are trying to make a quick sale. there is never any pressure or hard-sell. they want satisfied customers. and, they do not rush the call.

there are no short-cuts or cutting corners with mosley. if you want a beam for a lifetime, mosley is it.

hello mosley:

i took the antenna down to access the traps, and have a closer look at the rubber boots on the top of the traps.  these are all intact.  i did find water coming out of the bottom of the 30 (top trap), and 17 (middle trap).  
i also noted the rubber sleeve on the top part of the rubber boot wasnt tight?  i believe moisture was able to wick down through this into the traps.  so, i sealed them by wrapping these boots/caps with stretchy self sealing tape, etc.  after doing this, i have found that the traps arent as badly affected by rain or fog.  therefore doing this improved the situation.

im impressed with this antenna.  i like its performance, and the fact it covers 40 to 10 meters easily.  i was also impressed with how it was boxed for shipping, and how it was marked, labelled, etc for putting it together.  well done.

subject: re: mosley ta-33-m 3 element antenna msp

thanks gary for your quick reply. 

i decided on the mosley antenna because i had read many reports praising the mp33n .

this was my first choice but it was not immediately available in the u k. the fact that you have an unbroken record over many years of manufacturing first class antennas was the deciding factor in choosing mosley. 

after giving the antenna  a series of tests, as i have already said, i am very pleased with its performance and together with your reply to my minor doubts reassured me that i made the right choice.

may i comment on one thing.   i have been involved in amateur radio since 1951 and i find it strange having to decide on setting the optimum length of the element to middle of the top or bottom section of the band.  perhaps this due to having  a wider band in the usa.  i suggest that it would be helpful if antennas intended for sale in the uk had pre drilled holes for the centre band.

kind regards,

thanks for all your assistance. after cleaning up the q match connections (one on the ground side of the 40/20/15/10 element was very corroded and loose) and replacing 3 cracked antenna mounts i'm happy to say the intermittent swr om my ta-63m 'seems' to have been tamed.

you are a credit to the amateur radio industry.  your patience, professionalism, and advice finally got me on the right path to correcting the problem.

for the time being i'm leaving the beam in the 63m configuration. maybe when it gets cooler here in texas in the fall i'll make the conversion to the current n dimensions and spacings.

subject: rv-4c testimonial

this is the one commercially made vertical amaterur radio antennas i can brag about.

i bought my rv-4c from a local ham.  i don't know its age. i do know construction is excellent.  compared to the other brands this is not the cadillac, but it is the roll royce or mercedes benz. 

i live in an antenna restricted area.  this antenna fits the requirement of being easy to deploy, and it works great even at this low point of the sunspot cycle.

2 years ago i used a competitor's antenna for field day. it took more work to put up and resonate, even though i had it up previously.  it also did not work as well as the rv-4c.

this year i used an rv-4c.  quickly assembled and raised on one of my speaker stands. i deployed 4 counterpoise radials as stated in the manual.  i only operated qrp and had more contacts than in 2019 running  100w.

i've since used it at night and on week ends (times when i don't need approval for a portable antenna).  in the short time i have it up i have already worked 30 states and 18 countries since field day.
pending approval i hope to install the rv-4c behind the house.  until then i'll use it portable.

i confidently recommend this antenna to others due to its high quality and excellent performance.

subject: comments about mosley and customer service

to: fellow hams

i just hung up the phone from talking with chad at mosley electronics about obtaining parts for my old mosley ta-33 jr. beam that has been in storage for over 40 years.  sort of a barn find type thing.  it was missing several hardware pieces and needed new screws, bolts, brackets, caps, etc.  chad was very helpful and patient with me as we went over my parts lists and made sure i was ordering the exact correct parts.  i felt like i was talking with a buddy from down the street, not a "corporation" person.  

i plan to get this antenna in good shape in time for field day for our local club, then make it available for other field set-ups.  this is but one of four mosley beams i have owned over the past 56 years.  i currently have a classic 33 that has been up for 35 years and has gone through a major ice storm that caused the elements to droop severely and several severe mid-west winters. that antenna has not been down since i first put it up and it still looks and works as good as new. the elements are not bent, or slewed out of alignment.  

here is what i can tell you about mosley electronics:

1.  they are an american company and self-owned.  there is not "parent company".  they call their own shots.  as a result, they are not pressured to compromise quality for the sake of shaking out more profit. 

2.   as nice and helpful as they are, you probably won't have the opportunity to talk with their customer service / parts dept. people because things just don't go wrong with these antennas.  oh, if your tower blows over and damages your antenna or, if like me, you put it away for years and then can't find all the parts when it is time to put it back together, then you may need to give them a call. how many things do you have that you can still get parts for, from the original manufacturer, 30-40 years after you bought it!  
hint:  if you see a used mosley antenna for sale at a hamfest flea market, even if it is missing some parts, not to worry.  you can get the parts needed to get it back working like new.  don't miss an opportunity for a bargain.
                
3.  when they say these beam antennas are easy to put together, they are not kidding.  you don't have to do any tuning or complex assembly of parasitic elements, etc.  the elements and traps have color codes that tell you what fits with what.  if the color codes have worn off, you can figure out what-is-what by simply looking at the measurements in the instruction manual (available online if you buy a used one without the assembly pamphlet). 

4.  unless you like pulling your beams down to the ground every two or three years to fix or adjust things, then these mosley beams are the way to go.  very trouble free.  

5.  pricing:  they may not be the cheapest antennas on the market, but keep in mind they are very high quality and, most likely, you are not going to have to spend a penny on repairs or take it down for adjustments for, ...well, i don't know how many years.  i am over 35 years with my cl-33 and still going.  i am guessing my coax will go bad before the antenna does.  remember when you bought something "made in usa" and you knew it was made with the best materials and craftsmanship available anywhere in the world and built to last?  well, mosley still holds those kind of american values.  

i don't know anyone at mosley and this was the first time i had a need to call them.  so, this is an honest assessment of the company.  5-stars !

the pro-57b seems unfazed by it but our roof not so much so and will need replacement. 

my question, we would like to put a metal roof i am concerned if it would affect the performance of my pro-57b. the antenna is at approximately 35 feet above ground, our roof is 8 to 9 ft above ground - about 25 ft between roof and antenna. the tower is on one side of the house so at any one time about half of the antenna is above roof.

tim, you can use this "mash note" in your advertising!  

i have owned two mosley antennas in my ham career.  i got the first one, a 10 year old ta36 as payment for a debt & bought the 40m traps, etc. before i put it up.  that was 1968,  it served me well until 1994 when like a @#$%^& fool, i sold it for $250 because i just knew i would never have another tower.

lo and behold, i bought this qth in 2002 and some years later i put up a tower.  i bought a new-in-the box ta33mw for $200 from a guy who was getting a divorce & needed untraceable cash.  i then bought the 40kr tips at market price & put the whole shebang complete with a hb 6m yagi and an 18 el. 2m yagi. 

we had  a storm come through which slightly bent my hbdx40 tower.  

the ta33mw/40kr survived without a scratch.

there is no other antenna than a mosley.  the rest are just aluminum!

both antennas worked flawlessly.   i just took my 50 ft tower down because i am moving from ny to florida.   i have donated the ta36 to the local scout camp for their use and jamboree on the air.   after wiping it down it still looks new and works perfectly. 

it withstood hurricanes, snow and ice storms, thousands of contacts round the world, 3 lightning strikes, and whatever else in the 42 years it was up, so far. 

thank you for making such a reliable, sturdy product.   i would recommend mosley without hesitation.   ease of construction.   very low swr.    its has brought me some great contacts.   i live on long island.   my house elevation is 135 feet above sea level.   used the rotor plate with a 10 foot mast. the rotor is the yeasu g-1000dxa. 450 degrees. tower was rohn 25g. 5 sections with the anti- rotation arms and 3 guys.

greetings, 

finally got around to assembling and mounting the mini-32a i purchased a few months ago.  tuning was simple; nearly spot on to the suggested starting point dimensions.

swr is great across all three bands.  even the band edges are easily matched to 1.1:1 with the flexradio internal tuner.

my first five contacts were germany, belgium, spain, aruba and argentina with only 50w.

thanks mosley for the nice design!

hi all at mosley!

i have previously been in touch with you regarding this wonderful antenna, that i inherited via a long detour from my father.  it is shown here after a severe snowstorm that virtually stopped all transport in stockholm and sorrounding areas.  naturally i wanted to check my antenna site, which i can do remotely via the security cameras with good picture quality.

the sun just broke trough the clouds and the antenna was absolutely shining from above my 50ft tower, remarkably beautiful at least to me!

the story of the antenna i sent last time is attached below for info.
still a great antenna, i could not be happier except for maybe adding a second director, is that even possible?

and, looking at the preliminary scores, thanks to this antenna i will, for the second consecutive year, become #1 sweden in my class in the 2018 cq ww..!

that is a dream come true and to do it twice is fantastic, i am totally over the sausage here! 

have a great week all friends at mosley from a snowy white and beautiful stockholm, sweden ! :)

best regards,

subject: pro 67b replaces ta-36   

just wanted to say thanks... i finally got the pro 67b up to sadly replace my much used ta-36.   same great quality, same damn flat blade screws as the ta that's been up and down at four qth's since 1990. everything mosley said it would be and more with great swr across the bands
with a little tinkering. 

it bothers me to see some of the reviews where hams complain: the manual is too small, antenna is too big, there isn't a diagram separate page to tell you where to place every part and screw, .front lobe is too wide, front to back ratio is too small..blah, blah... that scares many young hams away from a great product. sure, there are others, a little more gain (they advertise in dbi)  on 20, lighter, smaller, that fall apart with an inch of maine coastal ice.

my advice ( as an old marine at 70...wife says i'm just full of advice...) tell those guys to just read the manual, use it as a learning process, find an old timer that's had one, and probably still has.. ask questions, build it once right, put it up high and forget it for 20 years while you enjoy what it will do.

still the best antenna built.

to: 'mosley electronics, inc.'
subject: re: pro-96

hello chad,

i am not sure who at mosley might be interested in this, so i decided to pick on you.

the pro-96 beam has been atop my 72 foot crank-up tower for about two months now and has been performing excellently! i am more than pleased with the antenna. it has performed exactly as the specifications indicated it would. in fact, the swr on all the bands is slightly better than the predicted figures of the brochures. the swr is so good that i dont really need to use my antenna tuner if i choose not to.

assembly was a bit awkward only because i had to work alone until the time it was put onto the tower. even so, it went together quite easily and with no problems other than the one mistaken measurement i made, which you helped to clarify.

my first contact with the 40 meter portion of the beam was the japanese research station in antarctica. what a pleasant surprise that was with the conditions being as poor as they are at the bottom of this solar cycle. the beam has cut through pile-ups, heard signals that others dont and looks fabulous atop the tower.

i want to thank those at mosley who put this design together and cut the parts for it. everything was flawless. i made the right decision when i made the purchase and have absolutely no regrets. thank you all for a fantastic addition to my station.

best wishes (73),

bob walters

ps: i have attached a picture of the beam along with its cousin the mosley am-56, which is also a fabulous beam.

we had hoped for.  and the construction is outstanding. we did have to add more tie downs then we at first though but this is not a problem. one antenna is installed atop a 3 story building with 2 sets of tie downs. when the storm came thur here last month and winds were gusting 65 to 70 mph. the antenna withstood it without any problems at all. thank you for an outstanding antenna and i hope to be ordering more sometime this spring.

subject: tw-33-m & sf-402-a

hi there,

before asking my question i would like to say what an excellent antenna is
the shorty forty.  i finally put it up at 15m and it has transformed my 40m
working.  for example today i was 59+ into california at my dawn, as usual. i realize it's a reduced size antenna but the increase in performance from my previous antennas on 40m it great.

now comes my query. i have a tw-33 as numbered above.
at present it is down.  the question is: can i run it without the extensions for 30m?  i don't use 10mhz, so it will not be a great loss to me.
i realize i'll have to protect the traps.  fyi i made a two-element 12m/17m beam using some mosley traps from a 20/15/10m tribander. of course, i had to re-tune them. it was great:  until i got the tw33-m.

the tw-33 is even better. i sold my home-brew for a good price!

as i wrote above, can i leave off the extensions for 10mhz?

friends at mosley electronics, wa8rei of freeland, mi here.  i've had a pro 67 b at 48 feet for nearly 6 1/2 years now.  i bought it used from a silent key's estate in atlanta, ga.  i have no idea how old it is.  all traps were disassembled and cleaned, as well as all tubing connections prior to installation.  the tower is guyed at 25 and 46 feet by 3 massive, commercial grade guy anchors and 3/8 inch wire rope.  the tower base is on a 5 x 5 foot concrete slab, 3 feet thick.  i have a yaesu gs-065 thrust bearing roughly 2 feet below the boom of the "monster mosley" which greatly reduces the load on the rotator.  the mast sits snugly inside the tower top section and is well lubricated with all-temperature grease.  i have used a hy-gain ham iv rotator with absolutely no issues.  i do not attempt to rotate the antenna in a windstorm!  duh!  in 6 1/2 years, the antenna performs like new.  it has withstood 65 mph winds, rain, snow and ice storms.  the 40 m. elements have a little droop, but really perform.  i run only 100 watts, no amp, but bust many dx pileups.  i often run 5 watts qrp in contests or sprints and have many winning plaques and certificates.   the antenna is resonant on 6 meters and performs well on that band with no dedicated elements.

i am glad to see mosley ads in qst after a long hiatus.  young hams know nothing of mosley quality antennas unless they are told through ads or hams who own them.  i'm sure many old timers like me have heard of the ta-33 or ta-33 jr just by word of mouth from am, ssb or cw operators!  

"here's the original!  none better has ever been made!"  i'll vouch for that!  i'd take a mosley over a steppir [with more wind load] any day.  

thanks  to all employees for designing and making an excellent product.
