st. croix beach guide
did you know... st. croix is ringed by beaches of all shapes and sizes, some are long white sand stretches, others are small patches shaded by low sea grape trees and towering coconut palms. some have smooth sandy bottoms ideal for swimming, and others have rock and coral-lined entries perfect for snorkeling!

did you know... st. croix is the only caribbean island where a diver can:
âdive a wall that drops over 13,000 feet
âdive a reef that is the largest living reef of any caribbean island
âdive five wrecks that are within 100 yards of each other
âdive a piermore info     









st. croix weddings / romance
did you know that... many couples are opting to save the money (not to mention the stress and hard work) of a big wedding at home by escaping to a caribbean island for a combination wedding/honeymoon. upon their return, they can share the event by showing the video and photographs at an informal reception.

all the islands are beautiful and, on some, weddings have become a major promotional tool. so why should you choose st. croix above others?more info









moving to st. croix
did you know... in addition to it's long and rich multicultural history, friendly people, open spaces, the blue sea and near perfect year-round weather, there are a number of reasons to consider relocating to st croix. most importantly, the u.s. virgin islands, which includes st croix, operate under u.s. law which is important in both business and personal matters. 

this means mainland us companies do business here including retail stores such as k-mart, radio shack, office max, mcdonald's and wendy's. also u.s. financial services including a variety of u.s. mortgage, insurance and banking companies offer local service.  u.s. cellular phone companies including at&t and sprint, both operate here.more info 









st. croix cruise ship arrival
our port

the ann e. abramson pier is named in honor of the virgin islands public works commissioner who was responsible for much of the rejuvenation of the frederiksted area. this is the pier where most of the large cruise ships dock, as well as military ships, submarines, and other naval vessels. from time to time, tall-ships especially from denmark, can be seen here.

the dock itself has been a favorite diving place especially for viewing bright coral, sponges, and a multitude of fish life. a night dive should reveal the sea-horses unique to this pier. visitors arriving at the pier often walk through the small town of frederiksted and walk to the nearby beaches and beach club.more info
