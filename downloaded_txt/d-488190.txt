igbt & scr drivers, inverters, converters, bridge rectifiers, switches & semiconductor assemblies









high power inverters

	5-500 kilowatt inverters, ac controllers and igbt inverters are available with full bridge, half bridge, 3-phase bridge, chopper and soft start circuits.  options include air or liquid cooled, voltage feedback, current feedback, thermal feedback, snubbers,  laminated bus, dc filter capacitors, fuses, and blowers/fans. our single phase or 3-phase inverters are designed to fit a wide range of applications or custom designed to fit uniqe requirments.




high power converters

	our high power converters are available in single phase, three phase, poly phase, ac switch, parallel configuration and static switch configurations.  options include air or liquid cooled, voltage feedback, current feedback, thermal feedback, snubbers, laminated bus, filter capacitors, output bus bars, and blowers/fans.  these products are widely used for high-power motor control, high-power ac-dc power suppplies and high-power dc-dc power supplies.


high-power semiconductor assemblies
our high-power semiconductor assemblies are available with single, doubler, three phase, full bridge, series stacks, parallel, ac switch, static switch, common anode/common cathode topologies.  options for include air or liquid cooled, bus bars, gate firing boards, fuses, snubbers, blowers/fans, thermal switches, insulated mounting and fiberoptic interfaces. we offer a wide range of power semiconductors to satisfy a wide range of power management requirements.
 




igbt and scr gate driver boards

	our igbt and scr gate driver boards come in full bridge, half bridge, 3-phase bridge, single, doubler, twelve pulse, ac switch and high voltage driver circuit boards.  options for our igbt and scr converters include voltage feedback, current feedback, thermal feedback, device fault protection, circuit protection and fiberoptic interface.  our scr and igbt controllers are made to fit a wide range of applications and can be quickly customized to meet unique applications.




custom high power systems

	we offer custom high power systems design utilizing our years of experience with power component technologies.  we we can design build entire high power system with state of the art enclosures, digital / analog interface signals, control and monitoring circuitry.  our advanced cooling techniques with baseplates, heatsinks, fans, blowers and liquid cooling devices ensure your custom power supply design will have the best in thermal management.
