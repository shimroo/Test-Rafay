since 1934 lone tree golf & event center has been a favorite to bay area golfers. set at the base of mount diablo state park, the rolling terrain provides spectacular vistas of this scenic delta region. the course design blends ample landing areas allowing for playability, with intriguing green complexes that provide just the right amount of challenge. the occassional wayward tee shot may require navigating mature red oaks, cypress, eucalyptus, and the ponderosa pine that frequent the rough areas.
