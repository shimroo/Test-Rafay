dragtruk enters a new era!

up until this point, i have been soley responsible for maintaining
dragtruk.  my ever shrinking amount of spare time has
regrettably allowed the site to fall into a state of disrepair.
fortunately, that is about to change.  i've modified the
software which runs the site to allow for multiple admins, as opposed
to just one.  having more than one person to police the site and 
keep on top of things should greatly increase the quality and value of
the site in general.

i would like to take this opportunity to welcome 
kevin tolliver 
to the
dragtruk team!  kevin is an experienced drag racer, has appeared on
the speed channel's "pass time" show, and is obviously no newcomer to
running a truck down the quarter mile; he's been with dragtruk as
a user basically since the site's inception, and currently has
three trucks listed.  he has graciously volunteered
his time and effort to make dragtruk a better site, and i would
like to extend a hearty "thank you!" to him for that.
as an admin, kevin will be working with me to keep on top of the
double listings, bogus entries, and basically clean up and maintain the site in general.
if you have questions or need any help, he can be reached via e-mail
at kevin@dragtruk.com.

many thanks to the dragtrukkers like kevin who have stuck with the site despite
its slow decline.  hang in there, it just gets better from here!
