i am sorry but advancing years and prices have forced me into a position where this site is more of a vanity project. my hertford blog pages have been removed and only a few other posts remain.
what remains is links to my published books and how to purchase them on amazon and draft2digital as well as the most popular articles on folly island, round the horne, billy bunter and such like.
thanks to all those people who have read the site, contacted me and in such way added extra colour to various pages. for the time being the site will remain up and running.
latest published paperback : the mysterious death of sarah stout. an unsolved death from 1699 in hertford. murder, suicide or accident. the facts, background and solution explained here.
