focus on
kfx sic integrated handlebar





the kfx sic (stable integrated cockpit) 1-piece handlebar is the complete race ready cockpit.  by integrating the bar and the stem, fsa has eliminated unnecessary hardware and components. the result is a lighter weight system with increased strength in a visually stunning package. icr compatible, allows for up to 5 cables or hoses to run internally resulting in a clean, integrated cable routing solution for frame and bicycle brands.

focus on
ns vas stem





fsa's new vibration absorbing stem for gravel application is the first of its kind.  featuring significant vibration damping via 360 degree handlebar isolation. in turn, reducing forces and impacts to the rider's hands and arms.  the result being less arm pump and hand fatigue for a better ride and shorter recovery.
