i am very negligent of this blog - but i have recently updated my new blog (which is focused more on the house): http://groudasfamily.com/nicolesblogand i've done a little stitching, but not much to show yet.  i want to at least finish the current motif i'm on before taking a picture but it's all over one so it's a slow going motif.  plus i haven't had a lot of stitching time, i had one stitching day a few weeks ago and that's about it!

2010 stitching - my stitching treasuresfinally some stitching!  i got this pattern with the silk threads and charms for my bridal shower from all my friends (they actually paid for a shopping spree for me and this was the top of the list).  so new year's eve 2009 i pulled it out - around 11:50pm actually and this is my foray back into stitching!i've now been organizing my sewing room again and getting really into it.  new year's eve/day i stitched the outline and then last week i stitched the deer and rabbit.  another night i stitched the flower bush and top left start.  last night i stitched the 3 mini motifs (over 1), the 2 potted flowers and started on a backstitch block.i love working with silks and this piece is such a wonderful treat.  i do hope to continue this until i get bored and then start some other pieces i've had in mind for a while!

my other website is temporarily down - should be back up by the end of the week but i think i'll start updating this one on stitching stuff again ...the problem was i wasn't stitching at all because of house related projects.  so my other blog is all about the house.of course the not stitching does not work for me :)  so as of new year's eve i started a new project!  i'll post a picture soon now that i know i'm going to blog about it.but first - let me go over my 2009 goals and see how i did...2009 goals1) hem my bridesmaid dress for sister's wedding [done]2) hem other bridesmaid dress for sister's wedding [done]3) make flower girl dress for sister's wedding [done]4) finish page 3 of celtic banner [more than halfway through page 3]5) make baby sampler for coworker's baby by first birthday [done]6) work on amish quilt [nope :(]7) finish embroidery on leanne's quilt blocks [nope :(]all in all it was a good year for not really stitching - i pretty much only stitched celtic banner during my maine vacation and the sampler for a coworker.  but that is changing now!i'm not going to set goals this year since months seem to fly by with everything going on but i do hope to stitch for fun and sew for fun and blog about it more often than last year!

it seems i can't keep up more than a single blog - so i've switched over to a more family friendly blog that catalogs our activities.  unfortunately stitching isn't high on that list of activities lately since we're working on the house primarily but there will be halloween costumes up shortly since i'm working away feverishly on those.if you want to continue to follow my life the new blog is located at:http://groudasfamily.com/nicolesblogso this may be goodbye for my blogger blog - we'll see. 2 months away from blogging here is indicating that it's too much for me to maintain a second one :)

finally a picture!i framed the baby sampler yesterday - the baby's first birthday just passed so i thought this would be a good gift for her.  i decorated the matte a bit because it just looked so plain when it was just white.in other news we just finished up our vacation last week to celebrate our 1 year anniversary!  i can't believe it's been a year already!  this time last year i was in hawaii!  man how things change.  this year we spent most of our vacation working on the house.. details with pictures to come of course!  we also went down to nyc for 3 days (well really 1 day with travel on the other 2 days).  and this week it's back to work and craziness but i'm just holding out for labor day weekend when we  go camping with the whole family!
