a life of prayer and service on the prairie
 
the benedictine sisters of sacred heart monastery make their home in western north dakota. we strive to provide a contemporary template for gospel-driven living by modeling a communal, monastic, christian way of life.
since the arrival in 1910 of our sisters in north dakota, god has always guided us to preserve this way of life and ensure our viability in times of change and challenge.  our monastic life of prayer and work follows the natural rhythm of the western prairie, with times for working and resting, growing and harvesting, living and dying. the “promise of the prairie” reflects god’s sustaining power in our lives, even in times of uncertainty and doubt.
