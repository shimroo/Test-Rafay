the book is about journey of one man's life who survived deadly childhood ordeal. losing loving parents, brothers, sister and relatives. losing everything multiple times and starting over from nothing. it shows dedication, mental thoughts, perseverance and hard work that he endured to get to where he is now. i congratulate his accomplishments. i am glad you made it through and hope you continue to be successful.

the hardships and trauma that killing fields survivors had to deal with is unimaginable and the fact that some never let that stop them is pretty amazing. tony lai tells the full story, where many of these memoirs stop in the refugee camp or upon arriving in the us, tony shares what he accomplished over the following 40 years, and that was a lot! i recommend this one as a great variation to the other memoirs about the killing fields.
i did receive a copy of the book from the author, but that in no way affected my review. it was a great book.

this book is an autobiography of a cambodian orphan who lived through the killing fields and fought against all odds to be successful in post-war cambodia. the book is easy to read. it begins with his life in the killing fields, the loss of his parents and his post-war journey from cambodia to the refugee camp in thailand, to new zealand and finally to america. drifting from one place to another at the very young age, he fought against poverty by going to school part time, working various jobs, and testing his limits with new skills to achieve his “financial freedom.” i am amazed by how many jobs he had to go through during his 30 plus year journey, from “bicycle taxi driver” to goldsmith, to chef, to real estate agent, donut-shop owner, hamburger-shop owner, computer network administrator, and finally to “the inception of khmer tv”. he persevered despite the misfortunes of his business burning to the ground during the rodney king riots, and being robbed at gun point. in his last chapter, he describes his approach to success in life. it is inspiring and worthwhile for our younger generation to think about.
thank you for sharing your mazing story.
