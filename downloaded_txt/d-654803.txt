about us 



in 1991, i visited a health show trying different things. one of them was kinesiology. i was curious to know why the person on the stand was able to move my arms and legs around without my control? so to find out, i joined a weekend course in kinesiology. one thing led to another and i qualified in 1992 with the association of systematic kinesiology.after collecting a few years‚Äô worths of dr sheldon deal‚Äôs seminars, i wanted it all organised in one volume, and the first edition was written. a few more years have passed since then and i have updated and expanded the first edition with the latest techniques to help kinesiologists.

clients testimonials 








as you know, kinesiology is not my only therapy, and therefore i don‚Äôt use it 100% of the time, now when i do need to use it i can be so much more effective because i can always find the answer easily.i know i am a good kinesiologist in my own way but seeing the book has made me realise how much i had forgotten! one of the reasons i had stopped using some of the techniques was because i had no diagrams to remind me, now i have.thank you for all your hard work in producing this book. an invaluable tool.cyla higley homoeopath, kinesiologist, reflexologist and acupuncturist with 17 years of experience  the first thing that strikes one is the fact that the compendium contains many, many illustrations. the illustrations are clear and easy to understand. the combination of text and illustrations adds a new dimension to easy learning and understanding to many of the techniques.the second thing to be noticed is the sheer number of techniques and procedures covered in this compendium. contributions have been added from many sources with accreditation to those concerned. the compendium is simply and clearly indexed and cross-references occur regularly throughout the text.this is a book to have. it provides a great deal of information and enables new techniques to be part of one‚Äôs treatment. the compendium has been updated from the previous edition and alan lam obviously has been able to offer simplicity and more clarity to his previously already marvellous book. this is a reference book to have for all kinesiologists.i take great delight in endorsing this wonderful reference on kinesiology.john logue ask committee member, uk guild of hypnotist examiners committee member, masters in neuro-linguistic-programming (nlp), full-time kinesiologist with 10 years experience as a therapist  dear alan, thank you for sending me your updated compendium of techniques so quickly. i am happy to be able to confirm that it surpasses the previous book i had in all ways, and that says a lot in itself.i call your book the ‚Äúultimate test kit‚Äù. it is with me by the treatment table and on all my teaching trips. i can find very easily any technique i need and because of your cross reference many techniques i had not remembered. it is precise and concise and therefore extremely useful. it saves me from referring to so many notes and papers, saves me a lot of time, all the charts we use are there with information for my clients, etc.it obviously contains the best kinesiology information that is, the sources are impeccable as are the design and the graphics. we are all so fortunate that you have chosen to use your great skills to our benefit.thank you very muchbrian miller a member of the academy of systematic kinesiology for 11 years, initial council member of the association of systematic kinesiology (ask), and initial advisor to the kinesiology national occupational standards authority england. co-founder of the whole health centre london, the coveyheugh project scotland, body management systems and functional kinesiology uk and europe  this second edition of ‚Äòkinesiology; a compendium of techniques‚Äô represents a quantum leap from the first edition. many of the techniques, such as cranial corrections, are now accompanied by really detailed graphic reproductions making written instructions and information 100 per cent clearer and easier to understand. for the individual kinesiologist to use personally or as a teaching aid this edition is a must.geoff powell full-time kinesiologist/stress management counsellor with 15 years of experience  i would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in kinesiology. i use this book constantly as a source of reference. with the best will in the world, everyone falls into a routine. this book helps me break out of that rut. it is very easy to pick up and use.trevor gale trustee of ask, full-time kinesiologist with 9 years of experience  fantastic, your clients deserve this book. it‚Äôs helped me become a more effective therapist. it reminds you of the techniques you‚Äôve forgotten you knew. tremendous value ‚Äì a must-havelincoln coutts kinesiologist in full-time practice for the last 8 years
