	dear sir

	i came into your shop in skipton recently with three friends, one of whom had used your o.s.t. ointment for several years for a painful knee joint. my other friend and i bought jars for similar painful knees. after 24 hours use we now call this ‘miracle ointment’. to be relieved of pain and now finding walking and stairs a lot easier it is just such a relief.

	yours faithfully

	just a quick note to say thank you for my speedy delivery of the gifts i ordered. they smell wonderful and am now placing my third order but this time to treat myself.

	thanks again.

	dear sir

	i recently purchased my second jar of active life cream. i thought i would take the time to write to let you know how fantastic the cream is but also how helpful the lady in the shop was. i needed the cream urgently before we flew on holiday and so i called to order. the lady who took my order upgraded it to first class (free of charge) and even said she would try to get in that days post. i received the cream in plenty of time and will be back for more when this has run out. thank you for the lovely customer service.

	kind regards
