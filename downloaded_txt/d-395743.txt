art quilter | author | teacher














ruth b. mcdowell (1945-2024) was a pioneer in the american contemporary quilt movement. utilizing the medium of found commercial cotton cloth, and the technique of traditional right-sides-together piecing, ruth’s body of work represents a sustained and extraordinary development spanning nearly 50 years. themes in her work follow several interweaving paths: geometry, botany, the natural world, color and pattern, abstraction and composition.
