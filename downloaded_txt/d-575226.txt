  a beautiful one-night getaway from houston.  the ant inn transports you back to a more genteel time and wraps you in its history.  easy to find off 290 we were there in no time.  our room was spacious and had a king bed.  the tv had more channels than we have seen in any other hotel, ever.  reception informed us of everything, even the sodas and ice cream in the ice room.  and our full breakfasts were included the next morning.  the hotel has free easy parking and the buildings all surrounding it were full of interesting murals. it was a perfect night.

  a beautiful location with very clean rooms and friendly owners. i booked the austin room and the charleston room. both were wonderful! i also loved the back balcony and how close the inn was to all of the downtown shopping. i would absolutely stay here again. actually, those travelling with me said that they would like to return to brenham just to stay in the inn!. rooms: all full of antique furnishings and very clean. walkability: the inn is close to all shopping, but the inn itself only has stair access to all but one room. all shopping is within walking distance of the inn.

  the room, decor and offerings were fantastic. our room was full of charm and superbly comfortable. the complimentary ice cream and sodas in the fridge were definitely a nice perk. the complimentary "cook to order" breakfast was wonderful and the hotel staff was perfectly polite and professional. i'd definitely stay again when back in brenham.
