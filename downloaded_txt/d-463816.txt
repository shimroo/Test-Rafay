thank you for your email, and for asking tiffany to work with us.  she was an absolute gem, and is exactly what we have been hoping for as we looked for new insurance coverage for our home and autos.  tiffany listened to what we wanted, and provided two excellent options that fit our needs.  she answered all our questions fully and was very helpful walking us through our policy‚Ä¶who knew insurance could be so fun! üòä
we are really happy to be a part of your organization.
thank you!

i have had naccarato insurance for over 30 years. they have been excellent. i‚Äôll be moving out of state the end of this month and tiffany has been helping me find an insurance company in nc since they won‚Äôt be able to keep me as a client. everyone is wonderful. i will miss them.
‚Äì carmen dean-squeglia
dina and the front desk lady helped get me insurance in just two days. i couldn‚Äôt be more happy with the service i was provided. they were extremely nice and understanding of my situation. i was out of work and they sped up my application as much as they could. what a great company. thank you so much guys!

pam was a wonderful help with my car insurance on friday afternoon!
‚Äì stephanie kaufman
i wanted you to know that mindy has been an amazing help to me. i‚Äôve been dealing with a very difficult situation with another insured‚Äô company. they‚Äôve done everything they can to drag it out (almost 3 months now) and make the situation more awful than necessary. mindy, however has been a rock throughout this ordeal. she has consistently given me sound advice and direction and i don‚Äôt know how i would‚Äôve gotten through this without her.
‚Äì rochelle mosse
thankful to have found such a friendly, welcoming and professional agency. lisa bolde made finding the right policy for me quick and easy. i would highly recommend naccarato insurance and lisa!
‚Äì bri c.
tiffany and susan are the best. i have nothing nice to say about my actual insurance company but these 2 ladies spent days fighting for me and in the end got damages to my truck covered and tickets dismissed due to the insurance company not standing behind their word. the world needs more people like them.
‚Äì preston jurkowski

bryan golden
for everyone involved in making the purchase of my first house a reality. it‚Äôs just the beginning of the american dream for me. susan, the relationship you have with sawyer was great. it took me right out of the middle and made it painless. i love this little town we have and how close knit it is to be able to work with all local and friendly people.
