over the years that the bhi and now intracoastal realty property management team has been managing the rental of our home on the marsh, the marketing team has successfully secured both high and shoulder-season rentals. the owner relations representatives help us present a well-maintained and welcoming property and ensure that guest requests and any maintenance emergencies are promptly handled. we especially appreciate our housekeeping team which accomplishes the impossible before new guests arrive on turnover days.

intracoastal realty was tremendously responsive. we had a flat tire a some point on both of our golf carts and we were inconvenienced for a whole 15 minutes while they came and replaced the flat tire with a brand-new one! excellent service to say the least!

we had a very good rental experience. we hosted a post-wedding dinner at our rental, which required more than the usual vacation planning. jennifer ayers from intracoastal realty was extraordinary! she was so accommodating, answering all of my questions, providing us with the dimensions of the dining table, and meeting my husband and i the month before our rental date to show us the house so we could take pictures for the florist. i would highly recommend intracoastal realty's bhi rental division. the views and the wrap-around porches on the front, back and sides of our home were spectacular!

my experience was great. it was an easy transaction; the rental company was very informative; and they used an app to assist with routine questions and provided daily updates, etc.

we just spent a week at march madness. everything was arranged through intracoastal realty and bald head island. we have stayed at bald head island at multiple locations over the last 25 years. our family has grown and we had a group of 13 this time. seven adults and six kids ranging from 12 and under. intracoastal did a great job of helping us with the rental, arranging tram reservations, and meeting us at the dock with our keys when we arrived. they were very responsive to any need that we had. the house itself was excellent. multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. multiple amenities including extra refrigerators, icemakers, etc. beautiful view of the marsh. kitchen and den area or on the top floor. bedrooms are on the bottom four so if you have folks that have mobility problems just be aware. three carts were a great amenity for the size of our family. several bicycles. the location was clean and well-kept. we were very close to what we consider one of the best access to the beach.

our vacation rental was great and truly a “home away from home”. the house had everything, even all the beach essentials. the owners and management team were attentive and a pleasure to work with. if you needed something, they were on top of it.  the sunset views from the deck were amazing and you’re steps away from beach access. will stay again.

the staff was great and very responsive, and the house was a wonderful fit for us. everything we could have possibly needed was already there! it was a long drive from alabama, but coastal nc is a magical place. thanks for the great customer service!

excellent home to enjoy the beach as well as the inter coastal waterway. 2 kitchens, 2 living rooms, 2 laundry hookups make a perfect place for multiple families to enjoy time together as well as time apart. dock for boating, fishing, and swimming add a second dimension to the vacation...it is not just the ocean beach for fun. comes fully equipped with the essentials. a great rental!"
