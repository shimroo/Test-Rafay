~
my old bible ~
though the
cover is worn, and the pages are
torn, and though places bear traces of tears,
yet more precious than gold is this book worn
and old, that can shatter and scatter my fears.

this old book is my guide, it's a friend by my
side, it will lighten and brighten my way; and
each promise i find soothes and gladdens the
mind, as i read it and heed it each day. 

to this  book i will cling,
of its worth
i will sing,
though great losses and
crosses be mine; for i
cannot 
despair,
though surrounded by care,
while possessing this blessing divine.

who has my commandments and keeps them,
it is he who loves me.  and he who loves me will be
loved by my father, and i will love him and
manifest myself to him."
