	with...god bless"

let your
italian recipe start here with organic oregano from
italy!



 















the perfect secret herb for all your italian recipes!











shipped directly to you in
days from the only
certified organic oregano farm in italy!











the 
unique gift for the chef in your life who has 
everything in the kitchen!











99% of commercial
oregano you've bought originates from turkey, greece and mexico.
it's
time to try italian!






can you
imagine your pasta or pizza sauce without it?
angela's oregano's pungent, spicy flavor makes 
it a perfect match for your tomato sauces, eggplant, seafood and 
grilled meats. try sauteing aromatic vegetables in virgin olive oil with 
garlic and our oregano.
 
you can make a savory sauce with melted butter, 
lemon juice and a bit of oregano; drizzle it over grilled fish and 
poultry. an easy way to accent pasta sauces, salad dressings and 
ground meat dishes is with a dusting of crushed oregano leaves. to 
release its flavor, crush our oregano by hand or with a mortar and 
pestle before using it in your recipes. 

 


italian
food is practically synonymous with oregano.


angela's oregano has a rich
flavor that harmonizes even with hot and spicy food, as is popular in southern italy.
it holds its flavor perfectly. our oregano's rich flavor deepens and melds flavors of soups and sauces 
without overwhelming the dish.
