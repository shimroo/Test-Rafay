americans for medical progress:we keep medical advances moving ahead


americans for medical progress (amp) is a team of subject-matter experts that helps create and maintain an environment where essential medical advances can continue to be made by companies and academic institutions in the research community. we do this through our facts-based public education programs that clearly demonstrate the irreplaceable role of animal studies. we also provide individualized support to partner organizations to help them respond to activities and misinformation that threaten future medical advancements and the greater discovery process. as a nonprofit with deep experience in animal research, amp is committed to being a trusted voice and advisor to ensure that the vital, highly specialized and ethically conducted work to preserve human and animal health keeps moving ahead.
we are a national 501(c)3 non-profit supported by the biomedical research community and people like you!
