it rains








it rains



older
and somewhat

immune
i believe, although

never
is one

immune

from
pain



it
rains always

it
rains and downpours

not
surprisingly

heaven
cries incessantly

while
my tears are sporadic



a
delicate life

a
baby pink tiny life

given
and sold

all the animals, all the graves,

the
coliseum



michelangelo,
rome

it's
no different:

here
in nowhere

a tiny yard

on
the earth, it's sky, a theater



i
was going to add something

but
there was nothing

to
add this time, only

a
deep sigh, a long slow

glance
at the ground



at
a small stand of

rock,
hastily

made
in spontaneous

thoughts

about
the meaning of objects

'morning depression






'morning depression 
i see you are already here
settled behind your desk
before i've opened my eyes.

which day






which day

another day?



black heart flown

to dilute your powerful poison

awake all night

wind your clock

it's tired

and all the boys

you've thwarted

they love you

they love you
not

nothing






nothing at all


i just wanted to say
i was briefly illuminated
and felt you near

treasure
people
friends are treasure
yet i rage

happiness
makes me decidedly
uncomfortable
and uneasy

depression
is my niche
my cubbyhole
such a little mouse

am i.
