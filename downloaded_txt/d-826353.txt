                                    "collecting in the field of old master paintings is presently an opportunity.
                                    incredibly dynamic paintings with history and soul can be bought for relatively
                                    affordable prices compared to works of similar prestige in the impressionist,
                                    modern, and contemporary markets. for example: baroque paintings of incredible
                                    quality are currently very fairly priced—especially considering they are
                                    tangible relics of the birth of realism in western art history. a new collector
                                    in this area must educate themselves in how to read condition, however the
                                    rewards of investing in collecting old master paintings are ample."
