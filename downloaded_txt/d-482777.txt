(pre-synopsis talk)bridging induced coil-to-globule transition and aggregation of polymers 






                    macromolecules or polymers are generally found in crowded environments. the interior of a cell contains a high concentration of macromolecules, typically constituting 20–30% of the total cell volume. crowders play a crucial role in the coil-to-globule (c-g) transition of macromolecules, which is essential for the functioning of biomacromolecules such as rna, dna, and proteins. the c-g transition can occur due to various factors, including solvent quality, co-non-solvency, temperature-mediated changes, depletion effects, and more. in this talk, i will discuss the c-g transition induced by bridging interactions, where crowders act as bridges or glues between monomers to facilitate polymer collapse. we performed extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the phase diagram of both neutral and charged polymers in the presence of attractive crowders. additionally, we explored the effects of crowder-crowder interactions, density, counterion valency, and crowder size on these transitions. i will also discuss the c-g transition in a mixture of solvent and cosolvent driven by solvent-cosolvent attraction, a phenomenon similar to cononsolvency. finally, i will briefly touch upon polymer aggregation in the presence of attractive crowders.
