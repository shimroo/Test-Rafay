what is wushu?

    


among china's well kept secrets, one caught the imagination of americans -
chinese wushu.
wushu is an important component of the cultural heritage of china, with a
rich content that has remained untarnished over the centuries.  literally translated, "wu"
is military, "shu" is art.  wushu therefore means the art of fighting, or
martial arts.


previously, wushu figured significantly in the simple matter of survival
through china's many wars and political upheaval.  today, wushu has been
organized and systematized into a formal branch of study in the
performance arts by the chinese.  it reigns as the most poular national
sport in the country of 1.1 billion people, practiced by the young and old
alike.  it's emphasis has shifted from combat to performance, and it is
practiced for its method of achieving heath, self-defense skills, mental
discipline, recreational pursuit and competition.


to describe wushu, it is best to understand the philosophy of its
teaching.  every movement must exhibit sensible combat application and
aestheticism.  the wealth of wushu's content, the beauty of wushu movents,
the difficulty factor, and the scientific training methods are the song of
the elements that set wushu apart from martial arts.  routines are
performed solo, paired or in groups, either barehanded or armed with
traditional chinese weaponry.  in short, wushu is the most exciting
martial art to be seen, felt, and ultimately practiced.


how is wushu related to kung fu and taijiquan?  "wushu" is the correct
term for all chinese martial arts therefore kung fu and wushu were
originally the same.  during the last thirty years, wushu in mainland
china was modernized so that there could be a universal standard for
training and competing.  in essence, much emphasis has been placed on
speed, difficulty, and presentation.  consequently, wushu has become an
athletic and aesthetic performance and competitive sport,  while "kung fu"
or traditional wushu remains the traditional fighting practice.  taijiquan
is a major division of wushu, utilizing the bodies internal energy or
"chi" and following the simple principle of "subduing the vigorous by the
soft."


although still in budding stages in many countries,  wushu is an
established international sport.  in 1990, wushu was inducted as an
official medal event in the asian games.  since then world championships
have taken place with 56 nations participating.  wushu is also vying for
the olympic games in the 21st century.
