located in eastern iowa in the small town of anamosa, the national motorcycle museum was home to over 500 motorcycles, a great bicycle collection and thousands of pieces of memorabilia. after 22 years in this location, however, the board of directors, lead by chairman jill parham, decided to close the museum september 4, 2023. “we have struggled for several years to cover wages and utilities partly due to low visitation.” the museum was one of about six motorcycle museums in america operated as a non-profit and was established in iowa by j&p cycles founders john and jill parham. as is proper with closing non-profits, the museum is using professional counsel during the process. we thank you for your support over the years.
