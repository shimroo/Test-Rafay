al-anon members are people, just like you, who are worried about someone with a drinking problem. 











how can al-anon help me? 



we all have different personal lives but we share a common bond as equals: our lives have been affected by another person’s drinking. al-anon is a mutual support group. we have been helping families and friends in crisis for more than 70 years.we can find understanding and support when we share our common experience with each other. some of us are here because a spouse or partner has struggled with alcoholism. for others, the problem drinker is a parent, child, or grandchild. sometimes a brother, a sister, or some other friend or relative brings us to al-anon. many of us have had more than one alcoholic family member or friend.alcoholism has similar effects on us all, even though our relationships to the alcoholic may be different. many newcomers are most interested in hearing about situations and relationships that are similar to their own. over time, however, we come to understand that we can benefit from hearing how the al-anon principles worked in many different situations. at our meetings you will hear that no situation is unique, we have all suffered the effects this disease has on our families. by supporting each other we slowly learn there is support, there is help, and there is a solution.
