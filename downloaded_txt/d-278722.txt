celebrating african american history month


when we reflect on black history, we often recall the inspiring legacies of leaders like dr. martin luther king jr., harriet tubman, shirley chisholm, frederick douglass, and katherine johnson, individuals who have profoundly shaped the course of american history through their unwavering commitment to justice, freedom, and equality. their courage and resilience continue to inspire generations to stand up against injustice and advocate for the dignity of all people.
yet, within the broader narrative of black history, there are voices that have not always received the recognition they deserve, particularly those of black catholics who, guided by their faith, worked tirelessly to uplift their communities and challenge the injustices of their time.
we honor the six black catholics from the united states who have been recommended for canonization, each of whom exemplified deep faith and perseverance in the face of adversity:
servant of god mother mary lange (1794-1882) – founder of the oblate sisters of providence in baltimore, the first religious order for women of african descent, dedicated to the education and service of black communities.venerable pierre toussaint (1766-1863) – a former enslaved man turned philanthropist, known for his generosity and commitment to the church, even after being barred from attending the dedication of st. patrick’s cathedral due to his race.venerable sister henriette delille (1812-1862) – founder of the sisters of the holy family in new orleans, an order committed to serving the poor and educating black children during a time of segregation and discrimination.servant of god julia greeley (c. 1833-1918) – a former enslaved woman in denver who dedicated her life to caring for the poor, despite her own poverty, and is remembered for her profound generosity.venerable father augustus tolton (1854-1897) – the first recognized african american priest in the united states, who persevered through racism to serve black catholics and establish a thriving parish in chicago.servant of god sister thea bowman (1937-1990) – an educator, evangelist, and social justice advocate who used her gifts to speak out against racism in the catholic church and celebrate the beauty of african american spirituality.
these individuals, both within and beyond the catholic faith, remind us that the pursuit of justice and dignity is an ongoing mission. their sacrifices, courage, and unwavering faith serve as beacons of hope—hope that calls us to continue their work, ensuring that all people, regardless of race, background or religion, are treated with the dignity and love they deserve.
as we reflect on black history month, let us be inspired by their legacies and commit ourselves to fostering a world where justice, faith, and equality thrive. their work is not finished—but through their example, we find the hope and determination to carry it forward.

associate spotlight – james mallare



associate james mallare speaks at a recent ritual of acceptance for new adrian dominican associates. 

“i couldn’t be anything else but dominican.”
that was the conclusion that adrian dominican associate james mallare came to during a recent time of reflection. that would most likely be the same conclusion of sisters and associates who work with and have come to know james. 
james first met the adrian dominican sisters through the “gentle nudgings” of sister mariane fahlman, op, a professor who taught him during his undergraduate and graduate years and as a member of his dissertation committee. james earned a bachelor’s degree in education with a focus on community health education; a master’s degree in community health education; and a doctorate in kinesiology, with a specialty in community and school health, all at wayne state university in detroit.
between his undergraduate and graduate programs, james helped sister mariane with her research on the effects of exercise on aging catholic sisters. “i was popping in and out of weber center,” the congregation’s retreat center, during his work with sister mariane. “it was during that summer that i really fell in love with the charism,” he recalled. he became an associate in august 2022, mentored by sister carol jean kesterke, op.
now in his first year as assistant professor of public health at wayne state university, james had spent 3 ½ years after receiving his doctorate working on a research study with the department of psychology at wayne state, studying the effects of asthma on children. these days “we’re occupied with working with underserved people and traditionally underserved communities, especially children who suffer from asthma,” he said. a certified health educator, he instructed parents about their children’s asthma and tested the children for asthma.
while he is still adjusting to his new role in the classroom, james said he truly loves his new job. “what gets me up in the morning [is] being with students who are naturally curious, who are really passionate about the intersection of social justice and public health,” he said. “i really get to see students come into blossom into who the creator has created them to be.”
in addition to his formal ministry, james and some of his colleagues work with the immigrant population of metro detroit. he collects some necessary housewares, helping the immigrants to set up and furnish their new homes. as an immigrant himself from windsor, ontario, canada, james realizes the challenges of moving into a new country. “helping these families find a pocket of peace in their new country really means a lot to me,” he said. 
james also carves out a saturday every month to volunteer with a shelter in downtown detroit, driving people to doctor’s appointments and other places.
active as an adrian dominican associate, james co-chairs the associates’ social justice circle, established under the auspices of the adrian dominican office of dominican charism, and serves on the advisory board for the office of dominican charism. 
as busy as he is, james is learning to slow down for prayer and contemplation, particularly in monthly contemplation sessions with adrian dominican sisters, another associate, and a franciscan sister from sylvania, ohio. “we sit for 30 minutes one sunday a month in just quiet,” he said. “i invite god into the space. after the half-hour, we share the fruits of our contemplation – a really dominican practice.”
for james, contemplation also means seeing christ in everyone he meets. “how do i find the aching, the poor, the hurt, the lonely christ in my neighbor?” he asked. he was especially inspired by a colleague at wayne state, the daughter of a baptist minister, who challenged him: “has anyone told you to adore the hidden christ in your students? you really have to try to find the god who is hidden in your students.” this practice, he said, enables him to pray throughout the day.
james believes his ministry in education also aligns with the dominican charism. “being an educator, you have to be a lifelong learner,” he said. “it’s part of my ministry now and part of my life as a dominican to really, purposefully set some time aside to study, to read about the new things happening in public health … that really goes hand-in-hand with the dominican charism.”
james summed up his vision of being a dominican: “for me, to be a dominican means to be someone who is completely in love with the creator and completely in love with the world around them, so much so that you are taking every opportunity to lead everyone to the creator in this joyful symphony we call life.”

dominican sisters of amityville & students travel to el salvador





trip to el salvador with our dominican family
by sister of st. dominic of amityville maureen muir
on january 2nd, a group of 16 students, alumni, and staff from both molloy university, ny, (founded by the amityville dominicans) and dominican university, ny, (founded by the blauvelt dominicans) set out on a ten-day trip to experience the people, places, and culture of el salvador. the visit was coordinated by molloy’s director of mission and dominican associate michelle martin and sister jenn schaff, vice president for mission and ministry and dana mcstowe, director of community engagement and leadership development for dominican university in blauvelt. diane capuano and i were also there as chaperones.
the students and alumni made this trip to el salvador, as they have been doing annually for several years, to work at the summer camp program for children up to ages 12 years old. the program was created and operated by our own sister flor de maria buruca. this program has grown over the years from working with kids at one site to working with children at three sites this year.
students and alumni were sent in small groups to be with the kids in sol naciente, once, and the newest site, san francisco. in the 90 degree weather, campers participated each day in creating arts and crafts projects, singing and dancing, as well as doing “community service” tasks intended to strengthen pride in their own community.
interspersed throughout the week were many fun and unique activities including a celebration of the feast of the three kings with sister flor and her sisters. there was a special mass, a party with cake, and music and dancing with all those in the neighborhood! with the help of flor’s sister mercedes our students dressed in the roles of mary, joseph, and the three kings!
the field trip this year for campers and students was to see the san salvador’ children’s museum and the dinosaur exhibit. both provided interactive and fun experiences and were truly enjoyed by all.
while in the city of san salvador, we observed the civil war memorial wall on which the names of all those who were murdered and/or disappeared during the war from 1979 – 1992 are engraved. we located the names of oscar romero and jean donovan. another highlight while in san salvador was our visit to the chapel of the divine providence hospital, a hospice for terminally ill cancer patients in san salvador. this is the chapel in which archbishop oscar romero was assassinated in 1980 while celebrating mass. flor coordinated a tour for us with a carmelite nun who ministers at the site. she graciously walked us through the chapel and the living quarters that had been romero’s home. deeply holy ground…
each night in el salvador our students came together to reflect and share on the day’s experiences. concepts discussed were deep, broad, and numerous:
“i’m just taking it all in.”
“i’m amazed at the simplicity.”
“even in the lack of resources there is such a joyous hospitality!”
“share what you have.”
“we have access to everything; i now have to ask myself; do i really need this?”
“don’t take my life for granted.”
﻿“be mindful.”
we thank god for this opportunity and for the depth in which our hearts and minds were touched. the students said they were changed because of this experience. i know i was too.
here are special videos from the trip:

sister spotlight – sister gail nimrod, op


the seeds of adrian dominican sister gail himrod’s life-long dedication to music and her 40 years at providence college in providence, rhode island, began years before and far away. born in wheeling, west virginia, sister gail and her family moved to ohio, first in columbus and middleton and finally in van wert. 
it was at st. mary school in van wert that sister gail met the adrian dominican sisters. she gained her love for music from her parents and took piano lessons from sisters catherine genevieve miller, op, and mary luke kinstle, op. in addition, she sang in the parish choir and in her high school chorus.
she entered the adrian dominican congregation in june 1954, ironically part of the crowd dedicated to divine providence. in her early years of religious life, sister gail taught in a number of adrian dominican schools in illinois and michigan.
sister gail holds a bachelor’s degree in music and english from siena heights college (now university) in adrian, a master’s degree in music history and musicology from the university of michigan, and a doctorate in music education and music history from boston university.
while taking a semester of courses at catholic university of america in washington, d.c., sister gail often went to the dominican house of studies for liturgy and use of the library. while there, she met a dominican friar from providence college in march and told him about her newly completed master’s degree. “he told me they were trying to start a music major at providence,” sister gail recalled. “he asked if i was interested and i was because i wasn’t doing anything with my degree.” in november, the friar asked her to submit her resumé. 
sister gail began her service at providence college in the 1974-1975 academic year. by that time, she said, providence was offering music courses but still had to develop the degree program – a project in which she became heavily engaged. “it involved looking at music programs at nearby colleges,” as well as writing up materials and the proposals to be approved by the committee on studies.
“there were specific history and theory courses outlined for a music major, sister gail recalled. students needed to take these courses, as well as private lessons for their instrument, to be declared a music major. 
sister gail also led the music department’s efforts to gain accreditation through the national association of schools of music (nasm). “the initial accreditation inquiry began with my attending the yearly national meetings in order to determine whether we were ready for this step,” she recalled. she directed the department’s self-study and drew up the required documentation. after the nasm visiting team’s report and providence’s response, the college was accredited to offer music major, sister gail said. 
in her ministry at providence college, sister gail taught courses such as the history of the middle ages, music in the classical era, women and music, music and society, and music appreciation for various periods. she also chaired the music department at various times, served on the faculty senate. her committee work included the diamond jubilee committee, preparing for the celebration of providence’s 75th anniversary, and the centennial committee, planning for the college’s 100th anniversary in 2017.
sister gail also played the organ for nearby parishes. for about five years, she served as assistant organist for the cathedral of saints peter and paul, often substituting for dr. alexander peloquin (1918-1997), the cathedral organist and director of music ministries, as well as a noted composer, director of the peloquin chorale, and composer-in-residence at boston college. sister gail has been gathering material for a biography she hopes to write of dr. peloquin.
while she served the college in a variety of ways over the years, sister gail has also placed much focus on the students themselves and is pleased with the lives of many of her students after graduation. “you hope they will become proficient in whatever areas they were involved in,” she said. her former students have not disappointed her. many are music educators in public elementary and high schools and some became private teachers in instruments or voice, conductors, or performers.   
sister gail’s identity as a dominican sister was also key at providence college, which is promoted as a catholic and dominican college. her work at providence college and her mission as an adrian dominican sister have never been separate, she said. a major part of her ministry was her dominican presence. “whether it be in a classroom or walking around campus or something else,” the presence was always important, she said. “i was a dominican – not just gail himrod but i was sister gail himrod. i was a dominican sister working alongside the dominican men and women.”
recently retired and residing in the motherhouse in adrian, michigan, sister gail continues her love for music, in part as a member of the choir.

world day for consecrated life 2025


on february 2, we join the global church in celebrating world day for consecrated life—a time to honor and pray for those who have dedicated their lives to god through religious vows. their witness of faith, service, and love is a beacon of hope in our world.
at a time when many long for reassurance and direction, consecrated women and men embody the promise that god’s love is steadfast, and his mission endures. their lives remind us that hope is not merely a sentiment but a calling—one that invites us to trust in god’s providence and become instruments of his peace.
as part of this celebration, lcwr, in collaboration with cmsm, cmswr, the us association of consecrated virgins, and the us conference of secular institutes, is hosting a virtual gathering on sunday, february 2, at 3:30 pm pst | 4:30 pm mst | 5:30 pm cst | 6:30 pm est. sisters, friends, and all who support consecrated life are warmly invited to join. registration is required to receive the event link. sign up here: register now
let us come together in gratitude and prayer for all those living the consecrated life, asking god to renew in them the joy and hope of their vocation. may their faith inspire us all to live with greater trust and boldness in god’s plan.
