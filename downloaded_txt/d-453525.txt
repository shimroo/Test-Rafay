office. they reviewed membership records and determined the nominees in good standing and included them in their report. then they advised those members and the general membership of the nominees by posting and distribution of the list of nominees, and the nominated candidates themselves by letter. the letter also described the steps necessary to accept the nomination and appear on the sup ballot which will be mailed for voting in the election beginning on december 1. candidates must accept the nomination by october 14, 2024 and must follow the instructions in the constitution and repeated in the letter. the report is as follows:    ttd supports ila port workers and calls out usmxwashington — greg regan and shari semelsberger, president and secretary-treasurer of the transportation trades department (ttd) of the afl-cio, issued this statement of support of america’s largest port workers union, the international longshoremen’s association (ila), as they continue negotiations with usmx ahead of the october 1 expiration of the current contract: “as america's largest transportation labor federation, we support the 85,000 unionized port workers who are fighting for a strong contract. their fight is our collective fight across the labor movement. usmx must come to the table and seriously engage with the ila union."relying on taft-hartley is not a winning strategy and should not be usmx's expected path to resolution. the biden-harris administration has already stated, in their own words, 'we've never invoked taft–hartley to break a strike and are not considering doing so now.' “america's longshoremen worked tirelessly through the covid-19 pandemic to keep our supply chain moving. they brave dangerous working conditions on the job to serve as a linchpin of our national economy. despite years of tireless bargaining efforts, the ila's efforts have been unjustly branded as unreasonable. why? for simply seeking the wages and benefits commensurate with their labor. nothing more and nothing less. "there is only one unreasonable party in these negotiations: usmx. their exploitation of longshoremen is downright shameful. usmx has had years to come to the negotiating table and bargain in good faith. instead, they have refused to engage in the process seriously and clung to the mantra of corporate greed."now, facing the midnight clock, usmx is crying wolf. let us be clear: the employers, not the workers, have shirked their responsibility and punted labor negotiations to the 11th hour, when the damage to the public and the national supply chain would be most detrimental. while usmx seeks to cast blame on the frontline workers who move our supply chain, they are at fault."remember this as they seek shelter from the disaster that they created." the sup is a member of ttd. ### update mailing address for important election informationthe pending sup election is conducted entirely by mail ballot. as a result, having a valid mailing

aloha-class ships to join its hawaii and china-long beach express (clx) services by the end of 2027. the first ship will be named makua, with a keel laid in october of 2024 in philly shipyard. with matson’s announcement to begin cutting steel, the three-vessel project hits an important milestone. the other two aloha-class ships will be named malama and makena. deliveries are scheduled for october 2026, april 2027 and december 2027. the ships will come in at 854 feet long with a carrying capacity of 3,600 teu, but are outfitted for a variety of container sizes and operate at speeds exceeding 23 knots. aloha makua!sup celebrates juneteenthgeneral order no. 3, issued by maj. gen. gordon granger in galveston texas on june 19, 1865, was the final enforcement of the emancipation proclamation made by president lincoln two years yearlier. today the federal holiday commemorates the official ending of slavery in the united states. the holiday's name is a portmanteau of the words "june" and "nineteenth" and is known as the national independence day. texas was the most remote state of the former confederacy and enforcement was sorely needed. importantly, as throughout all slave societies, it is the terms and conditions of employment that replace slavery, and are encoded in the order. "“the people of texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the united states, all slaves are free. this involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that of employer and free laborer. the freedmen are advised to remain at their present homes and work for wages.”   sup remembers and honors those that died in service to the nationmemorial day got its start as "decoration day" after the civil war, but for the u.s. merchant marine the idea stretches back to the birth of the nation. u.s. mariners have served the national defense since before revolutionary war and in every major military action since then. most famously, in 1941, when england was on the verge of being invaded by germany, president roosevelt convinced an isolationist u.s. congress to pass the lend lease bill to send food, oil and munitions to england to stave off an invasion. the u.s. navy did not have cargo ships so the maritime commission was created to charter ships from commercial shipping companies to deliver the essential materiel in time to save england. the lend lease bill was also deemed vital to the defense of our country.after pearl harbor, every ship was put into action, including matson and apl's luxury liners. but the new internationally known and hastily built liberty ships delivered troops, planes, food, ammunition and fuel oil and became emblematic of the merchant marine at war. they suffered horrific casualties in the early years of wwii, as submarines targeted the allied supply-chain in these slow moving ships.sup crews were attacked in the far east, the west and east coasts of america, in the mediterranean and the murmansk run, and rode at anchor off normandy the night before d-day. when censors lifted the informational blackout the new york times noted it right away, reporting from london on saturday, june 9,1944 that “d-day at the normandy beach head would not have been possible without the u.s. merchant marine. now landed in france, it is permitted to indicate the part played by these intrepid civilians, whose deeds for the most part have gone unsung. it is not generally known that the merchant marine suffered the largest ratio of casualties of any branch of the services, and many of the names on the list are not classified “wounded” or “missing” in march 1941 because their graves are at the bottom of the oceans.”sup honors mariners on national maritime day, may 22, 2024may 22nd is set aside by a joint act of congress and by proclamation of the president of the united states to honor the sacrifices and contributions of u.s. merchant mariners during times of peace and war. the day was chosen in 1933 at first to commemorate the american ship savannah’s first successful steam-powered crossing of the atlantic. since then it has grown to recognize much more. the roots of the u.s. merchant marine predate the founding of the nation, and was critical to the spirit of independence and winning of the revolutionary war. throughout the decades, mariners and maritime policy have been integral to the nation. in world war ii, more than 250,000 members of the american merchant marine served their country and more than 6,700 gave their lives as 800 ships were sunk. athought it is neither a national nor contract holiday -- yet -- it is the only day that recognizes merchant mariners as key figures advancing our national prosperity and security.  workers memorial day - april 28, 2024each year on workers memorial day, unions and working people throughout the world remember those who were hurt or killed on the job. we also remember that 50 years ago on april 28, the occupational safety and health act went into effect, promising every worker the right to a safe job—a fundamental right. no one goes to work to get hurt or killed. more than memoriam, however, on this day organized labor renews its struggle for safe workplaces, wherever they may work.it was the labor movement that organized for safer working conditions and it was the labor movement that demanded action from the government to protect working people. since then, unions and allies have fought hard to make that promise a reality— and although those that work on ships do so outside technical osha jurisdiction, the standard is still set high by the law, and our jobs are safer as a result. but there is far more to do.  each day, more than 340 workers are lost and more than 6,000 suffer injury and illness because of dangerous working conditions that are often preventable. “the best way we can honor the people killed or injured at work is to recommit to fighting for safer workplaces,” said april sims, president of the washington state labor council, afl-cio. “if you have a union, you can join together with co-workers to demand safe and healthy conditions. if you don’t, you must rely on state and federal safety laws that, too often, aren’t enforced or have penalties that are too weak. washington’s union movement will continue to fight to improve workplace safety laws, but if you really want a voice in making your workplace safer, form a union.”tragic bridge collapse in baltimorethe key bridge in baltimore was struck by a ship and collapsed killing workers trying to make the roadway safe. our thoughts are with them and their families; we grieve along with baltimore their loss. we recognize and thank the us coast guard, baltimore's police and fire department, and other first responders who acted fast to save lives and secure the horrible scene. the enormous risks that maritime workers undertake everyday - and work hard to mitigate - are suddenly obvious to the world. exposed too is the vulnerability of the u.s. supply chain that relies on low-cost, lightly-regulated foreign shipping as much as shaky and aging maritime infrastructure. in the recovery and awaiting the findings of the investigation, the sup and maritime labor will continue to insist on the highest levels of safety across the wide spectrum of global maritime operations. we will persist in our efforts to better protect workers and their communities against the risks of crippling and catastrophic failures made more likely by the profiteers of international shipping.sup celebrates 139 yearsthe sailors’ union of the pacific was organized on march 6, 1885, on folsom street wharf in san francisco. it is one of the oldest maritime unions in the world. because of the dedication of its members, and the opportunities brought about by collective action, it has survived and flourished, through good times and bad, for nearly 14 decades. back in the 1880's it was a bold and dangerous proposition to organize a union, since there were no laws that allowed for the collective bargaining and no protections for workers. fifty years later, in 1935, the national labor relations act would attempt to both recognize and replicate what sailors took it upon themselves to organize long before that, at a meeting of sailors speaking and listening, in the fog and rain on the old embarcadero. they had no rights. under federal law they were serfs at the beck and call of the shipowner, the crimp, bucko masters and mates. recognition, respect and improved conditions did not come easy. men bled, and some died for it. during world war i and particularly world war ii, hundreds of sup members faced enemy attacks and went down with the ships. the sup today remains a vital part of america’s “fourth arm of defense,” solidly committed to u.s. sealift capability. whether it is pay, conditions, or opportunities, the sup still fights for fairness, still stands up for what's right, and continues to carve out a better life for its members and workers everywhere.sup halls closed for president's dayall sup hiring halls will be closed on february 19, 2024 for president's day, a national and sup contract holiday. u.s. maritime labor requests red sea communications upgrades on national maritime day, 2021 president biden declared that "we must protect those who protect our country...""since the first days of our republic, america has been a proud maritime nation.  to this day, the united states merchant marine is a pillar of our country’s prosperity, playing a vital role in the maintenance of our economic and national security.  through every period of peace and war, our merchant mariners have been dedicated to protecting our freedom and promoting commerce." now he has made good on that promise by responding to the union's request for greater protections in contested waters such as the red sea.a broad coalition of u.s. maritime labor unions joined a january 19th letter to request greater coordination between naval forces and u.s.-flag merchant ships off yemen and in the bab el-mandeb strait of the red sea. writing to transcom's general jacqueline d. van ovost, they expressed thanks for the efforts already made to protect u.s. shipping and urged further cooperation. labor noted the potentially catastrophic nature of the attacks on ships and agreed that the united states had a right to protect its sovereignty when threatened. in particular, to make it safer for american sailors to do their work, the unions made special appeal for secure communication links between u.s. commercial vessels and the naval vessels in the region. the incomparable value of the logistical capability of u.s.-flag ships and sailors in contested and treacherous waters is famous. the united states merchant marine has operated side-by-side with the united states military in every conflict in the nation's history. u.s. naval assets have historically protected u.s. ships and crews as they sail into harm’s way to providing materiel and supplies to the warfighter. the improved communication link will strengthen that bond and should deter other adversaries from taking unwise action against american targets. a demonstration to other carriers that the united states is committed to protecting its own shipping, might also also incentivize other carriers to put their vessels under the u.s.-flag, enhancing the appeal of the united states merchant marine, the letter said.union members in u.s. merchant ships continue to deliver the goods, as the united states merchant marine has done, in peace and war, since 1775.see the letter from maritime labor here.pentagon says u.s. will protect its merchant ships and sailors as waves of attacks aimed at commercial ships came from iran-backed houthis in yemen months of defensive action shot down dozens of drones and missiles aimed at unarmed merchant ships in the red sea and other mideast waters. now, u.s. and british military took the first offensive action against the houthis to defend the international sea lanes. the pentagon issued a statement saying that it would protect u.s. sailors and ships and others that transit the area.defense secretary lloyd austin wrote "in light of the illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing iranian-backed houthi attacks against u.s. and international vessels and commercial vessels from many countries lawfully transiting the red sea, today the militaries of the united states and the united kingdom, with support from australia, bahrain, canada, and the netherlands, conducted strikes against military targets in houthi-controlled areas of yemen. this action is intended to disrupt and degrade the houthis’ capabilities to endanger mariners and threaten global trade in one of the world’s most critical waterways. today’s coalition action sends a clear message to the houthis that they will bear further costs if they do not end their illegal attacks.today’s strikes targeted sites associated with the houthis’ unmanned aerial vehicle, ballistic and cruise missile, and coastal radar and air surveillance capabilities. the united states maintains its right to self-defense and, if necessary, we will take follow-on actions to protect u.s. forces.since november 19, the houthis have launched more than two dozen attacks on vessels, including commercial vessels, creating an international challenge that demands collective action. today, a coalition of countries committed to upholding the rules-based international order demonstrated our shared commitment to defending u.s. and international vessels and commercial vessels exercising navigational rights and freedoms from illegal and unjustifiable attacks.we will not hesitate to defend our forces, the global economy, and the free flow of legitimate commerce in one of the world’s vital waterways."election season begins with labor's primary endorsements the election season in the run up to the presidential election in 2024 officially started yesterday, december 5th, when the california labor federation held its 2023-2024 pre-primary convention in oakland. elected

and women who have served the nation in time of war. we pay tribute to their valor, courage and sacrifice. as merchant mariners we understand too how such service can be overlooked or misunderstood. for us, it's not an empty holiday, not a formality, not a ceremonial tribute. the u.s. merchant marine has always helped defend democracy. and today as much as ever we remain grateful heirs to a tradition that keeps the supply lines open to deliver safety and victory at home and abroad. sup opposes second register proposalalong with a broad coalition of american labor and u.s. maritime unions, the sup signed onto a letter denouncing a second u.s.flag ship registry. forces inimical to the u.s. merchant marine and american mariners, this time represented by a washington think tank called the hudson institute, pushed for a second ship register, which would allow for a separate set of regulations while still claiming american status. the scheme would allow for u.s. naval protection while at the same time lowering wages, safety and environmental standards, and outsourcing of american jobs. effectively an american flag-of-convenience, it would hollow out american shipping as it endangers our national security and attempts to bust our unions. accordingly, the sup joined a letter in opposition urging the biden administration to soundly reject the notion.sup remembers bloody thursdayunion strikers amid the tear gas, including members of the sailors’ union of the pacific confront police armed with billy clubs and firearms, as spectators watch from safety atop rincon hill in san francisco, on the morning of july 5, 1934.the big strike, as it was known, came in may of 1934, when maritime workers in every us west coast port walked out for better wages, conditions and union hiring halls. it reached a momentous turning point with the death of two strikers on july 5, 1934, which was instantly known as "bloody thursday." it led to a giant funeral procession and a general strike in san francisco, where all work was stopped for four days, eventually turning the tide toward union recognition and control of the hiring process.a pivotal moment in hard times, a time of deprivation and depression, when workers had no rights: the big strike was one of the most important events in world labor history. it had many cascading effects of worker empowerment, making west coast ports union havens, and soon became the driving force behind the legislative effort of the wagner act in 1935. known as the national labor relations act, that law recognized the rights of nearly all workers to form or join a union, the “magna carta” of american organized labor still elemental to employment today. they fought and died, and created a better america.  sup celebrates juneteenthon june 17, 2021 president biden signed legislation that made juneteenth (june 19th) a federal holiday. the holiday's name is a blend of the words "june" and "ninetheeth," the date of its celebration. the new holiday officially commemorates the ending of slavery in the united states. it derives from the arrival date of union troops in geographically isolated galveston texas on june 18, 1865, when general granger announced emancipation in the form of "general order no. 3" which read in part: "the people of texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the executive of the united states, all slaves are free. this involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor."the national recognition of the pain and suffering of generations of black americans is monumental enough, but the holiday also speaks to honest employment relationships, as the proclamation says. a day's work for a day's pay, and for that, as well as all of the deep historical and social motivations, the sup celebrates juneteenth.  maritime labor opposes shipping reform that undercuts workerson march 17, the transportation trades dept of the afl-cio, of which the sup is a member, officially opposed the ocean shipping antitrust enforcement act of 2023 (h.r. 1696) to repeal the limited antitrust immunity afforded to foreign ocean carriers and dissolve the three major foreign shipping company alliances. this would have serious unintended consequences for dockworkers and other maritime workers that service these foreign ocean carriers at u.s. ports. we urge lawmakers to consider the adverse impact that this legislation would have on u.s. maritime workers.eliminating this limited antitrust immunity would undermine the ocean carriers’ ability to form vessel sharing agreements, which enable carriers to share space on one another’s ships. shared vessel space benefits both carriers and shippers by ensuring that vessels sail as full as possible, providing customers with more frequent service at more ports at a lower cost. the effect on maritime labor is considerable since these carriers are members of coastwise multiemployer bargaining associations that negotiate and administer offshore and longshore collective bargaining agreements. by operation, this means they have employer status, even though they do not directly employ the longshore workers who service their vessels.in addition, many dockworkers who work at small to medium-sized ports will suffer a decrease in man hours due to the elimination of vessel sharing agreements, as carriers will likely concentrate their services at larger ports because demand in these regions is higher and, in turn, vessel space can be filled more quickly. as a result of fewer sailings to smaller and medium-sized ports, there will be less consistent work at these ports, and a significant percentage of dockworkers will likely experience a decrease in work opportunity.we stand in solidarity with our longshore brothers and sisters, and all others in maritime labor by opposing the passage of h.r. 1696 and urge lawmakers to consider the adverse impact that this legislation will have on maritime workers. sup employee assistance resourcesthe sup welfare plan provides access to high quality and free employee assistance services including confidential counseling, financial help, online peer

approximately $1 billion. the first vessel is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2026 with subsequent deliveries in 2027. the new vessels will join two aloha-class ships previously built for matson that entered service in 2018 and 2019 -- the daniel k. inouye and the kaimana hila. like their sisterships, the new vessels will be equipped with dual fuel engines that are designed
