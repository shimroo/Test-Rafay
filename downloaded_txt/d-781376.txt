craftsman home plans
craftsman homes are usually 1 1/2 stories, feature low pitched roofs, exposed eave brackets,
                                wood siding and stone accents. these unique homes are known to incorporate tapered stone
                                columns and promote a more simplistic style that emphasizes outdoor living space.











vacation home plans
recreation and vacation house plans are known for their open living spaces and abundant,
                                lively feel. many styles are represented in this category, including a-frame, log cabin,
                                farmhouse, cottage, beachfront, florida, southwest and contemporary style homes.
