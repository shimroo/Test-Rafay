                      fountains bring a sample of natures
            flowing water into our built environment - from hotel
            atrium to living room. they add visual and audible interest to any
                      setting ... and remind us of the waterfalls, creeks, and
                      oceans we love. fountainfinder is here to help you  find your
            personal water fountain.

                      smaller size, this fountain lends itself to being placed on a
                    table, credenza, desk, counter, or bookshelf.
