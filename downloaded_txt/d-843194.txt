butterfly crush
	film


butterfly 
		crush is a modern love story about a
sydney song and dance duo, 
		who threaten to self-destruct on the brink of fame when one joins 
		a virtual dreaming cult in kings cross.
artmedia produced
this film last year, based on alan clay's novel, dance 
		sisters. the film 
			enjoyed a theatrical release in new zealand last year.
the film has just capped off a string of 
			successes in the states by winning best feature drama at the indie 
			gathering film festival in cleveland, ohio. this follows the film 
			winning a prestigious award of merit from the accolade competition 
			earlier this year and official selection in festivals in four 
			states.

		the film is due for release in sydney and melbourne in april. you can find more information on the project at
www.butterflycrush.net 
				where you can also find a 4-minute trailer.

alan 
	clay's book, 
angels can fly, 
	a modern clown user guide, 
	is a 
	textbook for a fast changing art form. the traditional approach to teaching 
	clown is routine or gag based and this sits uncomfortably with teaching 
	practices in modern performing arts education and with today's audiences.

	following the adventures of 10 fictional clowns, 
this book includes a
