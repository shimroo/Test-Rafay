extension-based information for wildlife damage management

putting university research to use
the wildlife damage management program allows management experts and other stakeholders to address numerous wildlife damage concerns.  our staff coordinate research projects with an education and information dissemination program that reaches extension specialists, growers, nurserymen, and homeowners throughout new york state and the northeast.  there are numerous publications and links on this site to help people address wildlife conflicts.  also, there is information concerning current and past wildlife-related research projects.
 
national wildlife control training program 
the national wildlife control training program is a cooperative venture of cornell university, university of wisconsin-stephens point, extension, and professionals interested in wildlife damage management. we welcome the participation of state and federal agencies, industry trade groups, and private companies. the goal of the nwctp is to create and coordinate a uniform training program and to create national standards for nuisance wildlife control and wildlife damage management. the curriculum in the nwctp consists of core modules reflecting the principles and methodology of the best practices of wildlife damage management using integrated pest management as applied to human-wildlife conflicts. in addition to the core curriculum, there are dozens of species profiles with specific animal handling and control techniques.
community deer advisor information
white-tailed deer may be locally overabundant in many urban landscapes leading to plant damage, deer-vehicle accidents and tick-borne diseases. cornell university faculty partnered with the nature conservancy staff and new york state department of environmental conservation wildlife managers to create a resource for communities struggling with suburban deer concerns. see this link for more information and resources: https://deeradvisor.dnr.cornell.edu/
