history of macedonia (historyofmacedonia.org) is a scholarly research dedicated to the 2500 years long history of macedonia and the macedonian 
      nation. 

      we are macedonians, 
      not greeks, not serbs, not bulgarians, not slavs.   
      our ancestors conquered the persian empire and ruled the known 
      world for centuries before rome was a power. our  forefathers  fought for 
      free and independent macedonia more then 100 years ago, and  against the greek, 
       
       bulgarian and serbian 
      aggression. here, we proudly present  25 centuries 
      of our rich history beginning with its roots in ancient macedonia.
