a cdpap advocacy organization and free employment information bridge between consumers and personal assistant candidates







after 20-years of co-founding and nurturing a large consumer directed personal assistance program (cdpap) in new york city, the program and its participants have taught me a great deal about the unique nature of this home care delivery system (resume).  to promote the expansion of the consumer directed philosophy, i created this web site, wrote the statement entitled cdpap - fundamentals, prepared the resources section, developed a weekly newsletter to provide information about current program developments or articles and to post information about currently available personal assistant candidates.  in addition to the above i have prepared a history of the consumer directed personal assistance program (cdpap) in new york city 1977 to 2001 to outline the development of the program in new york city and to highlight the contributions made by a variety of individuals, both consumers and non-consumers and prepared the statement cdpap - different from all other home care programs.  finally, in response to inquiries from fiscal intermediaries about the cdpap, i assembled the following statement called recommendations, which i hope will help to move the program in a positive direction
