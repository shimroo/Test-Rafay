jun 27, 2024 —


jun 1, 2025






ondak blurs the boundaries between art and everyday life to explore the gap in between. this work counts on the spontaneous participation of visitors entering the gallery space. at the intersection of public art and site-specific installation, ondak’s piece engages everyone through the mundane and yet familiar exercise of being measured (height) with the name and date of their visit inscribed directly on the gallery walls.
