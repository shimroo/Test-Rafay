new! gigiigemin baaga'adoweyang "we are healed by stickball"
in its creation story, the game of baaga’adowewin is given as a gift and tool for life. after forced assimilation, the game was suppressed and remained dormant for almost a century. this film shares the return of baaga’adowewin, or stickball, as ojibwe communities walk the path of cultural revitalization and exercise their treaty rights to continue to heal from historical traumas and overcome challenges of today.
