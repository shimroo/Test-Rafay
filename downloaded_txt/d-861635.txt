 ed's tv was great to deal with in terms of buying and installing a tv. staff at the store was knowledgeable and helpful (way better than any big box store) and the prices were comparable if not cheaper in some instances. the installers were efficient and clean. definitely would recommend for buying a tv/sound system and especially if you need to mount a tv on a stone fireplace.
