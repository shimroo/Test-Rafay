			several rugged mountain routes. i then headed into utah to moab, east 
			into colorado, and kept riding east all the way to washington, d.c.!

			my trip italian delights, then short visits to slovenia 
			and croatia went! flights in april 2013 took me from steamy 
			bangkok to rome for a grand 90-day tour of italy. from italy, i continued 
			along coastal slovenia, followed croatias istria peninsula around, 
			then turned inland to the capital zagreb. the greatest challenge wasnt 
			the rugged mountains of italy, but the lofty euro prices! i managed 
			by free camping and picnicking for much of the trip. my online journal
			www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/europedelights has 
			lots of beautiful photos along with practical advice for cycling in 
			italy.

			2012 i set out with bessie too the bicycle on a four-month journey, off 
			the beaten track in thailand and cambodia. the theme was to 
			experience places that ive not been to before, many off the tourist 
			track. i took a bus from bangkok to nan province in the very mountainous 
			north near the lao border. from there i made a big arc around northern 
			and northeastern thailand, following the lao border and mekong river 
			much of the way. i then crossed into northern cambodia to visit remote 
			khmer sites before stopping in at the famed temples of angkor wat area. 
			i continued to the capital phnom penh and rode south to the coastal 
			plain before returning to thailand. from chanthaburi in the east i took 
			buses to songkhla in the far south and rode north via nakhon si thammarat 
			to a ferry for koh phangan and a meditation retreat. afterward i hopped 
			a boat to koh tao for a spell of scuba diving. you can read about the

			the ride began in san francisco, california, and followed the coast 
			south to oceanside in san diego county, headed inland to arizona, climbed 
			the colorado plateau for visits to the grand canyons south and north 
			rims, continued on to southern utahs canyon country, swung west across 
			the lonely great basins mountains and valleys of utah and nevada, crossed 
			the sierra nevada in northern california, then lastly rolled over the 
			golden gate bridge to san francisco. unusually, this time i simply headed 
			out the door for the ride without any planes, trains, buses, or automobiles 
			to deal with. also, no visas, as it was one of my rare bicycle tours 
			in the u.s.a.!
bills 2011-12 asian grand adventure with a backpackon november 
			22nd 2011 i headed to asia on a backpacking trip, indian ramble.

			south of india, where i traveled overland north to new delhi, then east 
			to kolkata, taking in lots of indian culture (and cuisine) over the 
			course of about three months. a short flight brought me to bangkok for 
			a spell of about two months of meditation, travel, and scuba diving 
			in southern thailand. story and photos begin at
