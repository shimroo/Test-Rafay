cx3: all hallow's cross
crest ranch christmas tree farm12200 empire grade, santa cruz, ca, 95060 

this is our third and final race of the surf city season. it's also race #5 of the bay area super prestige series, and contributes to the overall standing of the five race series. 
annual costume race
the highlight of surf city all hallow's cross is the costume race! this is by far the best race to spectate and participate in, so we encourage everybody to join the fun. put on your best costume and ride one fun lap of the course. who will land on the coveted top step? bring your ear plugs because we heard rock lobster is getting the marching band back together for the opening ceremony…and those guys are pretty bad. costs only $10. 
the course
euro or jungle? saturday's course was the "euro" version, some called it gravel with barriers, so today's course, a callback to the 2023 single speed world championships, will be mostly jungle
food
the good times crew will be serving up fresh and healthy breakfast and lunch on sunday. mostly vegetarian and vegan options
free entry for first timers!
if this is your very first cyclocross race, we're inviting you to join the fun for free! you read that correctly: your race is free if you've never raced cyclocross before. first-timers can sign up by sending us a message via the contact form with name, birthday and contact info, or by just showing up on race day. 
kids race for free!
in keeping with another tradition, kiddos get to race on a shortened lap around the expo in front of their adoring fans. parents are invited to ride the lap with their kids if they'd like. you can just show-up at the start line to join the fun! 
volunteer
surf city is a community event and we can't do this without your help! there are a lot of volunteer opportunities available. please consider lending a hand, you can reach out via the contact form. 

 registration 



online registration is greatly encouraged as it makes things run smoother race day. on-site registration opens at 8:00am and closes 15 min before each race.

no field limits or late fees.
cash and checks only accepted for on-site registration (we're still living in the stone age).
helmets required
riders under the age of 18 must have an athlete release form signed by a parent or guardian. if you aren't able to register online, please download this form and bring it with you to the event.
bike typeride what you brought. most of our courses favor a cross bike, but to minimize barriers of entry to the sport, mountain bikes are allowed, particularly in the beginner categories. 

 category info 

racers are self-categorized based on age and gender, and categories divide riders into fitness and ability levels. surf city is a safe and inclusive space for allcat ctypically beginners to the sport. you're either completely new to the sport or have ridden a cross bike on training rides, but haven't competed yet.usac cat 4/5 equivalent.cat bintermediate to advanced racers in both skillset and fitness. also considered the "working person's" category because the reality of life gets in the away of being competitive at the a level. usac cat 3 equivalent.cat athe fittest, most experienced riders race this category.usac cat 1/2 equivalent.kidsaged 9 and under, kids usually race a subset of the main race loop, and may do multiple laps depending on course layout. everything from push bikes to miniature cross bikes with 24" sewups are seen in the kids race, and prizes of fun bags with clif kids bars and the occasional medal (no cash or start money, sorry) are awarded to all.race upriders can race "up" in category, ie, masters can race in groups younger than their own, and juniors can ride with older age groups. all age groups can race in the open a, b, and c groups.

fine print


open and mens fields are open to all racers, men, women and non-binary


women's races are open to all cis-women, trans-women and non-binary racers


non-elite althetes (b, c, masters) may self-select the field that best fits with their gender identity, or that the feel is most appropriate for competetive purposes.


elite athletes (a's) may participate in the gendered field which is most athletically appropriate, as determinited by obra and usa cycling transgender athlete participation policies on elite competition



  please note that this is not perfect and our language is still evolving. we are doing what we can to include everyone who does not benefit from cis-male privilege and we are all better because of inclusion
