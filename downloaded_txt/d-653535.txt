the people of this state specifically and of this country in general do not value anything about public education. our states consitution states that it is the "paramount duty" of the legislature to provide for "basic ed". well common sense dictates that at least 51% of the budget would go to education. since 1977 the legislature has been bogged down defining what "paramount" and "basic" is. local schools should be able to collect more money locally and not rely on the state.

here is a posting from one of my new (to me anyway) favorite blogs: i write this not as a skeptic of the value of thinking about pedagogy and of improving one’s teaching–but, and level with me, dear readers–isn’t that what we do all of the time, throughout the year, without going to workshops or special “colleges?” isn’t this what we do, when we assign all or mostly new books to our classes each term, so that we can keep up with the current literature in our fields (and not incidentally, avoid boring ourselves with the same old readings)? isn’t this what we do when reviewing previous drafts of lecture notes to see what’s outdated or less useful, and to add new material based on your current readings and research, or to speak to the specific themes we;re emphasizing in this or that semester? aren’t we always adding new visual images, new ideas, and new slides to our powerpoint lectures? do any of us set out intentionally to bore our students to death? do we enjoy being out-of-date and out-to-lunch in public?i remember hearing about that legendary college professor who worked from yellowed note cards, or off of lecture notes on legal paper from the 1930s that hadn’t been revised since they were first drafted. remember him? me neither. i never met that guy or took his class–it was always someone’s brother’s roommate, or someone’s girlfriend’s sister who was in that class, and usually at another college or university. that professor is largely an urban legend, but “centers for teaching and learning” are set up and funded to guard against him in universities across the country. (do they also sponsor a “center for defense against unicorn attack?”)yes she's writing about college but easily adaptable to any teacher's situation.

yes...it's been a while but i'm responding to the nice folks (tw) over at stories from schoolhere are the five things policymakers ought to know:1 - building a "community" should involve more than "ice breakers", advisory, and muffins on a friday. what's wrong with good old-fashioned pep assemblies? don't moan about lost class "time". if planned well and with more than adequate support from staff and faculty school wide assemblies can help build that "community".2 - please know the difference between a "faculty meeting" and an "informational meeting". i can count on one hand in an eleven year career when the faculty meeting actually was that and not one dispensing testing dates, tardy updates, and/or signing a card for a hernia surgery. let's use e-mail for the info and our precious time to discuss ideas and issues of importance. 3 - teachers should have a voice in the hiring (or firing) of colleagues. this would mean peer evaluation and would actually be more meaningful than the system (at least my employer) uses now. 4 - please have follow through with your "grand" visions, mission statements, etc. policymakers at all levels have problems with this. i hate dead ends or change for change sake. 5 - please policymaker read this article for a wealth of knowledge.ciao,tllabels: meme: five things policymakers ought to know

i wish i had more time to post and since they are few and far between i'm posting an entire article:concord, n.h.  -the state department of education has released a document intended to develop "a new high school delivery model," in which learning is tailored around students' interests and teachers mentor instead of instruct."this is the next step in moving forward with school redesign," said fred bramante, a member of the state board of education. "if we do this right, why would any kid drop out of high school?among the changes were a provision that would allow high schools to maintain a school year of 990 hours instead of 180 days and a mandate that by the 2008-09 school year, students must have the option to earn credits by demonstrating mastery of a subject instead of taking a course in that subject.bramante described the vision document as a link to the minimum standards that "articulates the vision, spirit and intent behind the rules.""my fundamental hope is that it will inspire high schools across the state to take advantage of the increased flexibility" of the revised minimum standards, state board member daphne kenyon said.six "guiding principles" for redesigning high schools are outlined in the document:• students should feel a personal connection to their high school experience. school guidance programs are important, as are internships and lessons customized to each student's learning style.• all students should be held to high academic and personal standards.• students must believe that what they learn is relevant to their lives; students should be able to personalize their learning.• teachers should be facilitators, mentors and coaches.• each student's learning should be monitored and documented.• data about that learning should be used to tweak the system to make it better.education officials say some schools already emphasize personalized learning. for example, merrimack valley high school offers online courses and internships, and its staff members are developing a charter school that would assess students based on their demonstrated abilities. the csi charter school would "profile" students and then adapt the curriculum to fit their needs.merrimack valley principal mike jette said he hopes to pilot the concept of awarding credit for "real-world learning," as outlined in the revised minimum standards, at the charter school next year and then bring it to the high school in 2008-09.i like it because it's different.
