trade show organizer benefits
						
a simple management process - all the trade show organizer has to do is approve exhibitors and retailers
the organizer will be able to view activity at the online trade show
the system is very customizable - the look and feel of the website can be customized to match the trade show organizer's branding
additonal features can be added as needed, for example, allowing exhibitors to approve retailers that have access to their online booths, having different sections for different exhibitors, having featured exhibitors/sections - if there is a feature that is important for your customers, it can be added!
the tradeshow can be set up in a very short time - the customization can be minimal or extensive; exhibitor onboarding can take place while front-end customization is still being finalized
the tradeshow can be set up to run for a specific period of time or continuously
