my latest book: the biggest number in the world

 

my latest book, the biggest number in the world – the fourth i've coauthored with agnijo banerjee (winner of the 2018 international mathematical olympiad) – will be published on may 5th, 2022. 
 
we all know that numbers go on forever, that you could spend your life counting and never reach the end of the line, so there can't be such a thing as a 'biggest number'. or can there? 
 
 to find out, we embark on an epic quest, revealing the answers to questions like: are there more grains of sand on earth or stars in the universe? is there enough paper on earth to write out the digits of a googolplex? and what is a googolplex?
 
 then things get serious.
 
we enter the strange realm between the finite and the infinite, and float through a universe where the rules we cling to no longer apply. we encounter the highest number computable and infinite kinds of infinity. at every turn, a cast of wild and wonderful characters threatens the status quo with their ideas, and each time the numbers get larger.
