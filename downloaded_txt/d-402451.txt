making the switch from microsoft to free!





i have read lots of posts and stories all over the net about there not being software of comparable features and power for linux. many people are under this illusion and therefore choose to stay with microsoft and pay out their asses to boot. well i for one am tired of paying for software and operating systems. so i decided i would take some time and find very good software/operating systems to replace the crap i currently have had to pay for. below you will find a list of very good operating systems and a nice sized list of free (except when noted) software. i have tried to include everything that would be needed on most desktops and workstations and even included accounting and tax software as those seem to be two of the biggest problems. i didn't include any games, but rest assured there are thousands of very good games out there for linux. including doom, simcity, civilization, qauke and many more.operating systemsubuntu – debian based and my personal favorite – extremely easy to install, configure and useknoppixpclinuxdamn small linuxgentoosuse linuxmandriva linux – also very easy to install and useredhat linux – very flexible and comes in numerous configurations for desktop/workstation, server, enterprise server, etc.anonym.os – only available as a livecd that is used to boot the computer and run it from cd. very useful if you need to be totally anonymous or are just a privacy fanatic. maybe possible to install but not sure.slackware – very popular but not the easiest to use/learnfreebsd – based on bsd (unix)openbsd – based on bsd (unix)applicationsbusinessquasar accounting – replaces quicken/quickbooks – not freequasar point-of-sale – runs cash registers and ties it to your accounting software – not freegnucash – replaces quicken/quickbooksbanal – book keeping systemgraphicsdia – diagram editorgthumb – image viewerblender 3d modellergimp image editorkookawings3d – 3d mesh modellerinternetamsn – msn messenger for linuxamule – emule p2p clientbittornado – bittorrent clientdirectconnect -  p2p network/clientepiphany web browseretherape – graphical network monitorethereal – network traffic analyzerfirefoxgaleon web browsergnomemeeting – similar to microsoft's netmeetingkonqueror web browserkopete – trillian style instant messenger for aim, icq, msn, yahoo and morelinphone– skype style voip telephony programmozilla mail clientmozilla web browsernicotine – soulseek network filesharing clientthunderbird mail client – similar to microsoft outlookofficeabiword word processoradobe acrobatreadermozilla calendaropenoffice.org suite – replaces microsoft officeother cool applicationscelestia space simulatorgnomepredict – satellite trackergramps genealogy systemprogramminganjuta ide – integrated development environmentbluefish editor – web development editorboa constructor – rad tool for python and wxwindowseclipse – integrated development environmentgazpachointerface designer – design graphical user interfacesgphpedit – edit php source filesquantaplus – web development environmentscreemhtml/xml editor – website editor and management systemmultimediaamarok – winamp on steroidsaudacity – record and edit audio filesgnomebaker – burn cd/dvd discsgnomoradio music player – find, download and play free musicgrip – cd player/ripperhelix player – very good media playerk3b – cd writing program (does dvd's too)mplayer – very easy to use and no fuss media playernomad jukebox manager – upload, download and edit tracks on your creative nomadogle – dvd player with menusrealplayer video playerserpentine – create audio cds from music filesvlc for gnome – media playersystem and security applicationsfirestarter – desktop firewall toolgnomepgp – pgp encryption programsynaptic package manager – the best package manager on earth.special note: if you install a version of linux like debian or ubunto that has the synaptic package manager preinstalled you can use it to find all of the software listed above and much much more. plus you can select numerous programs from the package manager and have then all automatically installed and configured, including dependancies. it is now as easy as windows/osx to install software using the synaptics package manager. plus the package manager has a windowsupdate style feature built in that will check and prompt you whenever there are updates to any of the operating system or software installed on your computer.
