                                    in celebration of daad's 100th anniversary, we're highlighting the stories of just a few of the tens of thousands of daad alumni who have participated in daad-funded exchanges between the united states and germany since 1925. this week, almut spalding tells us the story of her grandfather, werner könnecke:  
 
among the first cohort of students sponsored by the daad was werner könnecke (1899-1967), who spent the year 1925-26 at eden theological seminary in webster groves, missouri, near st. louis. as a pastor closely affiliated with the confessing church, he was drafted early into ww2, but survived as an interpreter thanks to his english proficiency. this and a deep desire among his descendent generations to foster international understanding and exchanges point to the long-lasting effects of a daad year abroad.

                                    february is black history month—a time to celebrate the achievements and contributions of black individuals worldwide. it's also a moment to reflect on black history in germany, where afro-german communities have long been a vital part of the cultural and social landscape.

for example, may ayim (1960–1996) was a pioneering afro-german poet, educator, and activist who played a key role in raising awareness about the experiences of afro-germans. her legacy lives on through her poems, essays, and contributions to the afro-german movement.

                                    hallo! i’m kendyl, a fourth year student at the university of british columbia in vancouver studying international relations and honors german studies. in 2023, i had the opportunity to take on a 3 month digital editorial internship at the goethe and schiller archive with a professor at bauhaus university. today, i get to take over the daad instagram and share a bit about my experience!

i originally took german courses as a language requirement but later decided to pursue a double major, which although originally career motivated, quickly turned into a passion.

i constantly tell people that studying german was one of the best decisions i have made in my university career. not only has it opened up amazing opportunities such as my internship in weimar, a position on my university’s ‘cenes’ student council, a taship in my department, and my ambassadorship with daad, but i have also gained lifelong friends, worldwide connections, and a strong, supportive community. through my internship, i discovered my passion for research, which led me to take on an honors project! wanting to share my newfound passion for research with my community, i co-founded an undergraduate research cluster promoting research accessibility.

my time in germany was truly life changing because it gave me the opportunity to grow personally, academically, and professionally. my internship at the goethe and schiller archive taught me the importance of academic exchange and collaboration, which is why daad’s mission really resonated with me. i’m so proud to be a part of a broader community of scholars who recognize the value of academic exchange and the globalization of research and education.

in addition to academic, linguistic, and professional development, my internship gave me the opportunity to explore germany, where i got to see historic sites, spend far too many hours in museums, see beautiful landscapes and architecture, and experience german culture. i am so excited to move back now that i have improved my german skills and have had such an amazing opportunity to learn about and promote german academia through my service as a daad young ambassador :)
