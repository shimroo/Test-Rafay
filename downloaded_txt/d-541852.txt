peter kalina/rebecca ashton
 a s h t o n k a l i n ad e s i g n e r c o l l e c t i o ndesigner jewelry created by peter kalina &rebecca ashtonartist statementabout usin 1969, peter kalina established himself as a jewelry artist in san francisco while working on his degree in the school of environmental design at the university of california-berkeley. in 1979, rebecca ashton, who had finished her degree in design and had established herself as a glass artist in the lake tahoe, ca area joined forces with peter and together they displayed their individual work at galleries and art shows. eventually they became a husband and wife team focusing together exclusively on their jewelry line which was designed, manufactured, and sold by them at their store in north lake tahoe for five years and at juried art shows throughout the united states for the last 35 years. in 2003, after many years of traveling for business, peter and rebecca decided to realize their long time dream of slowing down a bit and making maui their full time home. today, they still pursue their work in a less stressful fashion while enjoying the home they designed and built in upcountry kula. about our jewelryfor over forty years the goal of our work has stayed true to peter’s original aim of creating well crafted, timeless, signature pieces of various design according to our design series focus of the time. because of our longevity in working together creatively and technically, our body of work is quite diverse. the method of metal work we use is known as lost wax casting and or fabrication. our love of finely cut and well polished quality gemstones typically leads us to select a stone or combination of stones in creating a given piece. various types of finish work and precise stone setting, most of which are technical and time consuming, is reflected in each piece of finished jewelry. needless to say, we take great care and pride in what we create in hope of pleasing those who have viewed and purchased our work from all over the world through the years. ________p.o. box 659 kula, hi 96790 email: ashtonkalina@gmail.com__________

jaysonbrownjewelry@gmail.comhttp://www.jaysonbrownjewelry.com/1-808 463-1404since 1995 i have been creating jewelry in my home studio, first in the high country of colorado and now on the island of maui in the hawai'ian islands. here we are raising our family in my dad's tradition: surrounded by art. from mountains to sea natural beauty plays a role in my designs.as a child, art was present in my home as my father was a sculptor and art teacher. his nurturing sparked my creativity and vision. there was never a time that he was not working on a project, even until his last days he was creating and building his masterpieces. the natural world, modern art, and architecture inspire me from conception of my designs through the final stages of their creation. i enjoy the balancing act between form and function. sometimes rustic, sometimes polished, i have always loved making wearable art.





















































































































































































nancy chesick
nancy weaver chesickpaper art * papier mache * encaustic * bookbindingliving on maui for 40 years has provided infinite inspiration for my work. i make my own pulp from upcycled paper for my three dimensional pieces. i then apply handmade papers, acrylic paints and/or dried flowers for the decorative techniques.  as an avid orchidist and gardener, i love incorporating orchids and other local flora and fauna in my pieces. all are water resistant, having many coats of a clear acrylic finish applied to each piece.bookbinding my hard bound journals are bound by hand using binders board, bookbinding cloth(spine) and handmade papers.  the signatures(inside papers ) are high quality italian text blocks.many of my book covers are my original papers.  they may be encaustic monotypes, up cycled fabric backed with washi paper or reproductions of my original art printed on cover papers.my leather journals are hand cut and sewn using different bookbinding stitches with waxed linen thread.   they may be embellished with leather, beads or handmade papers.  the writing paper is usually resume paper cut and assembled into individual signatures then sewn together with the leather cover to create the journal.my gratitude journals are hand sewn using different handmade papers.  i do thecalligraphy on the front which is the kanji symbol for gratitude or thankfulness.  each journal has a wrap closure with one of my handmade paper beads, as well as shells, coins or other stones and beads.the art of bookbinding has become another passion. artists journals, writers journals, address books, guest books, gratitude journals, all bound with beautiful original hand painted papers, imported handmade papers, leather, fabric, or original hand carved block or screen printed papers, are part of my expression in paper art.encaustic art is a new addition to my repertoire. i have been using paper with encaustic medium (bees wax and dimar resin) for these exciting new mixed media pieces. encaustic is an ancient technique discovered by greek shipbuilders.  the word encaustic means “to burn in”.  in my mixed media pieces, i use encaustic medium, which is beeswax, damar resin(a hardening agent) and oil pigments.      i may add handmade papers, real plant material, such as dried orchids,     or other found objects. each layermust be fused with a heat gun or          torch, “burned in”,  to the layer beneath.the encaustic monotypes are one of a kind original prints without a repeatable matrix.  i paint with the encaustic medium on a hot aluminum plate.  when the wax melts it may be manipulated with brushes and various tools to create a”painting”. absorbent handmade paper is then laid on the plate and the image is transferred to the paper.  i then place the monotype on a rigid, cradled panel and cover it with multiple layers of clear encaustic medium.encaustic mediums melting point is 160*-180*.  as with any fine art painting, it should not be exposed to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.  there is no need to worry about melting in typical home conditions.the surface of encaustic may be polished with a light buffing with a soft cotton cloth to maintain its luster or shiny surface.  encourage customers to touch and even smell the wax surface.encaustic paintings are durable and archival, beeswax being impervious to moisture.  when wrapping apiece for a customer, please use bubble wrap as opposed to tissue paper next to the waxed surface.papier mâché i make my own pulp from recycled paper, mixed with glue and paste.  after sculpting, each piece must dry for up to a week.  when the piece is dry, i use handmade papers, dried flowers, and acrylic paints for the decorative techniques.  the orchids i use in my bowls, are grown at my home in haiku.every papier mâché piece is protected by three coats of an acrylic sealer.they are water resistant but not to be used for liquids. the small round bowls i sell at the guild i call my hula bowls.  i sew shells, beads and my handmade paper beads onto each piece.  any of the smaller bowls could be used for jewelry, keys or any small keepsake.  they could even be used for dry foods, such as nuts, and wiped clean with a damp cloth.please come see my work at maui crafts guild or at the grand wailea artists in residence program on fridays.aloha, nancynwcmaui@gmail.com           808 283-9442

debra lumpkins
ink@debralumpkins.com808-442-2128debralumpkins.com 1. where do you get your fish?the fish are caught locally off maui's shores by my spear-fishing husband, neighbors, and friends. fish are always acquired using sustainable fishing practices, obeying size and catch limits.2. what happens to the fish when i'm done?i use non-toxic (soy-based) inks that are simply washed off, so that the fish may be enjoyed in a meal afterwards. i prefer to make my printsimmediately after the fish is caught, while it's still firm and plump. although sometimes, if the timing is inconvenient, they will be frozen for printing later.3. how many rubbings can i get from one fish?because the fish is usually the main course for our next meal, i work quickly to prevent the fish from getting warm. i can typically make about 4 to 6 rubbings off of a single fish printing session.4. ocean stewardshipworking to restore healthy reefs and abundant native fish populations is a top priority of mine. every month, a portion of my proceeds are donated to community based, non-profit organizations that are dedicated to marine conservation. i support/donate to the following organizations and encourage others to learn more about ocean conservation:eyes of the reef network (eyesofthereef.org/)hawaii wildlife fund (wildhawaii.org/)maui nui marine resource council (www.mnmrc.com/)the nature conservancy - hawaii (www.nature.org/)5. my cards and prints are printed in my kihei studio on archival, acid-free paper. they are suitable for framing. thank you!the japanese art of fish rubbing, gyotakui became captivated by gyotaku, the japanese art of fish rubbing, at an exhibition at the santa barbara museum of natural history many years ago. a traditional form of printing in japan since the mid-19th century, gyotaku was originally used by japanese fishermen to record their catches. i was immediately taken with the simple beauty and refined details of the art form, but it wasn�t until i moved to maui in 2008 that i began using my training in printmaking to create my own fish rubbings. though firmly rooted in history, gyotaku crosses cultures and boundaries and delightfully combines my interests in science, nature, history, and art.the subjects of my new passion are caught by my spearfishing husband and his friends off maui �s shores. to me, a successful gyotaku inspires the viewer to reverently contemplate marine life and our connection to it. i use nontoxic inks and every fish in my paintings is enjoyed in a meal afterward. i am guided by the traditional japanese methods, but i have adapted them to my own style, and i continue to experiment with new processes, beginning with the first application of ink on the fish. though i strive to capture the essence of my subject, i love exploring unconventional color combinations as i ink the fish and rub the paper or fabric, �feeling� the impression into existence.an original gyotaku features irregularities in the paper or cloth, which add character and individuality to the work, and the result is a strikingly accurate physical record that is also playful, allowing the opportunity for expression and happy surprises.ink@debralumpkins.com808-442-2128debralumpkins.com

rick strini
www.striniartglass.com1964- 2019 celebrating 59 years in glasswww.striniartglass.comstarting the backyard of my parents home in 1964 , i built a small glass furnace, along with a pottery furnace and began a life long exploration into the glass movement.at first just simply trying to control the glass, then moving along to try and actually make utilitarian objects. i spent years making stemware, vases, and craft related items to sell at local markets, but it wasn't until i attended a workshop with the now famous lino tagliapietra, glass master from italy, that i opened up the possibility to create anything i wanted. the skills that i had learned making stemware were now valuable to me to create custom work and on to become a master glass worker myself.i use the glass blowing technique that is traditionally italian and work at the "bench" blowing the glass with a stainless steel blow pipe.i have spent my life blowing by myself and learned this technique on my own. i continue to work alone and although it presents some limitations, i have figured out ways to combine my work to get beyond those limitations.i now spend most of my time creating lighting products, custom glass ceilings, wall art and sculpture. i have always used re cycle glass as my basic product and now have even invented a line of recycled-recycled product using my retired blown glass into a new fused and slumped line called "adventures in paradise" glass mosaics. i break up the glass and lay it out randomly, fuse it so that it is one piece again, and then when cooled, reheat it into a shape, mostly a dome lamp or wall pieces, back splashes and on.five top selling points of strini art glass1.   hand made by myself with out any assistance.2.   100% green company using recycled glass and recycling my own glass into new works.3.   i do custom “work” for clients and specialize in lighting, glass ceilings, and sculpture.4.   have passionately worked in glass since the start of the home studio glass movement of the 60”s    53 years.5.   now incorporating blowing,  fusing, and slumping into my 2 d and 3 dimensional work .  i currently use the web to advertize and show at the maui crafts guild to reach my audience. please visit. www.striniartglass.comrick@striniartglass.com808-344-7199www.striniartglass.com
