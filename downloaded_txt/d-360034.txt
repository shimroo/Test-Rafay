welcome to lupus trustofficial support and informationa resource for patients, carers, medical professionals and fundraisers.




















in 1991 the lupus trust (previously st thomas lupus trust) was set up to fund vital research into lupus and provide information on lupus. since then, we have worked tirelessly with nursing staff, clinical research teams, patients and those who care for friends or family with lupus. you can learn more about our background here. 



our aim is simple - we ultimately want to find a cure and in the meantime advance the treatment of lupus. we do our best to ensure factual information is shared around the world and that there is an understanding over the difficulties and often life changing circumstances that affect people with lupus. 



our online resource and community should provide many useful and interesting answers, however if you require more information or think we could benefit from additional content on this website, please contact us.
