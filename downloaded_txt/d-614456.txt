    la cocina is a nonprofit working to solve problems of equity in business ownership for women, immigrants, and people of color.
  

when these populations have greater access to opportunities, our entire economy benefits. despite owning a growing share of businesses, they still face barriers—earning 57-83 cents for every dollar their white, male counterparts make. 
  

 closing these gaps could add a potential $4.4 trillion boost to the u.s. economy, creating more jobs and opportunities for everyone.
  

we provide affordable kitchen space to talented entrepreneurs.

the high cost of renting a commercial kitchen makes it difficult for many working-class food entrepreneurs to formalize their business. our kitchen space lets people who were formerly shut out of the food industry find a way in.



we offer hands-on training, mentorship, and market opportunities.
new businesses undergo a series of classes in product, finance, marketing and operations. we provide 1:1 mentorship to guide businesses and connect them to a variety of sales opportunities, from catering opportunities to farmers' markets and brick and mortars, so they can grow their business. 



from kitchen to community: their stories matter
la cocina is built on the voices, experiences, and leadership of the entrepreneurs we serve. through media, digital storytelling, and community events, we highlight their work, celebrate their impact, and uplift the role of small food businesses in shaping our cities.
