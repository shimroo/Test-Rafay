[download] sftp disabled
     posted by ineiev, mon 27 nov 2023 11:00:33 am utc
recently, we discovered a vulnerability in our sftp setup, and couldn't fix it otherwise than completely disabling sftp.  this affects uploading files to the download host, namely, the download area and audio-video.gnu.org.

git post-receive udp syndication
     posted by carlc, thu 31 aug 2023 11:57:10 pm utc
a new commit-hook is available to install for git repositories that will send a single datagram via udp after each successful commit.  this can be useful for continuous integration (ci) schemes and elsewise when a push driven model is prefered to (e.g) regularly repolling upstream when changes may or may not have occured.

re-enabling reminders
     posted by ineiev, tue 02 may 2023 11:40:13 am utc
the periodical reminders weren't active since 2016-11-30.

now they work again, powered by a rewritten script.

to minimize the surprise, all previously existing reminder settings were reset; please re-enable them if needed.

coincidentally, the support for per-group reminders is dropped.  it means that group administrators can't setup periodical mails to other people any more; the users who want them should configure them in their account preferences.

ssh member access updated
     posted by rwp, wed 23 mar 2022 08:58:34 pm utc
the server hosting svn, hg, and bzr services has been updated. this should resolve the openssh obsolescence of sha1. please report any problems.
git server updated
     posted by rwp, fri 31 dec 2021 04:08:42 am utc
the server hosting git services has been updated. this should resolve the openssh obsolescence of sha1 that has been seen by early adopters. the switch to the new server produced some unexpected problems found by users due to incomplete setup. please report any problems you find so they can be fixed.

the server hosting svn, hg, and bzr is still pending. until then the mitigation for sha1 previously posted will still be needed. this is getting attention and will be updated as well soonest.
openssh 8.8 deprecates sha-1
     posted by rwp, mon 11 oct 2021 05:14:54 am utc
openssh 8.8 was released on september 26, 2021 and deprecated all use of the sha-1 hash algorithm.  this affects users using git, svn, hg repositories using ssh-rsa keys and who have upgraded to ssh 8.8.  (the cvs repositories are not affected.)  for user workarounds please see this documentation page.

on september 30, 2021, as planned the dst root ca x3 cross-sign has expired for the let's encrypt trust chain.  that was a normal and planned event.  however coupled with a verification error in the code of libraries authenticating certificates it caused some clients that have not been updated to fixed versions to have problems validating
