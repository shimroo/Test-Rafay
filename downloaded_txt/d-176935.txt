i’ve got a old-fashioned link-blog, pluralistic, where i post a daily list of links with commentary and analysis. if you’d prefer to get it as a newsletter, you can subscribe to the plura-list. both are free from surveillance and advertising.
 










mlms are the mirror-world version of community organizing
february 9, 2025 / cory doctorow / a place so foreign and eight more, articles, down and out in the magic kingdom, eastern standard tribe, news, overclocked, podcast, someone comes to town, someone leaves town
 



this week on my podcast, i read mlms are the mirror-world version of community organizing, a recent post from my pluralistic newsletter.

mlms prey on the poor and desperate: women, people of color, people in dying small towns and decaying rustbelt cities. it’s not just that these people are desperate – it’s that they only survive through networks of mutual aid. poor women rely on other poor women to help with child care, marginalized people rely on one another for help with home maintenance, small loans, a place to crash after an eviction, or a place to park the rv you’re living out of.

in other words, people who lack monetary capital must rely on social capital for survival. that’s why mlms target these people: an mlm is a system for destructively transforming social capital into monetary capital. mlms exhort their members to mine their social relationships for “leads” and “customers” and to use the language of social solidarity (“women helping women”) to wheedle, guilt, and arm-twist people from your mutual aid network into buying things they don’t need and can’t afford.

but it’s worse, because what mlms really sell is mlms. the real purpose of an mlm sales call is to convince the “customer” to become an mlm salesperson, who owes you a share of every sale they make and is incentivized to buy stock they don’t need (from you) in order to make quotas. and of course, their real job is to sign up other salespeople to work under them, and so on.

announcing the picks and shovels book tour
february 6, 2025 / cory doctorow / news, red team blues, the bezzle
 


announcing the picks and shovels book tour (permalink)
my next novel, picks and shovels, is officially out in the us and canada on feb 17, and i’m about to leave on a 20+ city book-tour, which means there’s a nonzero chance i’ll be in a city near you between now and the end of the spring!
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865908/picksandshovels
picks and shovels is a standalone novel starring martin hench – my hard-charging, two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant – in his very first adventure, in the early 1980s. it’s a story about the weird pc era, when no one was really certain what shape pcs should be, who should make them, who should buy them, and what they’re for. it features a commercial war between two very different pc companies.
the first one, fidelity computing, is a predatory multi-level marketing faith scam, run by a mormon bishop, a catholic priest, and an orthodox rabbi. fidelity recruits people to exploit members of their faith communities by selling them third-rate pcs that are designed as rip-off lock-ins, forcing you to buy special floppies for their drives, special paper for their printers, and to use software that is incompatible with everything else in the world.
the second pc company is computing freedom, a rebel alliance of three former fidelity computing sales-managers: an orthodox woman who’s been rejected by her family after coming out as queer; a mormon woman who’s rejected the church over its opposition to the equal rights amendment, and a nun who’s quit her order to join the liberation theology movement in the struggle for human rights in america’s dirty wars.
in the middle of it all is martin hench, coming of age in san francisco during the pc bubble, going to dead kennedys shows, getting radicalized by act up!, and falling in love – all while serving as cfo and consigliere to computing freedom, as a trade war turns into a shooting war, and they have to flee for their lives.
the book’s had fantastic early reviews, with endorsements from computer historians like steven levy (hackers), claire evans (broad-band), john markoff (what the doormouse said) and dan’l lewin (ceo of the computer history museum). stephen fry raved that he “hugely enjoyed” the “note perfect,” “superb” story.
and i’m about to leave on tour! i have nineteen confirmed dates, and two nearly confirmed dates, and there’s more to come! i hope you’ll consider joining me at one of these events. i’ve got a bunch of fantastic conversation partners joining me onstage and online, and the bookstores that are hosting me are some of my favorite indie booksellers in the world.

canada shouldn’t retaliate with us tariffs
february 2, 2025 / cory doctorow / a place so foreign and eight more, articles, down and out in the magic kingdom, eastern standard tribe, news, overclocked, podcast, someone comes to town, someone leaves town
 



this week on my podcast, i read canada shouldn’t retaliate with us tariffs, a recent post from my pluralistic newsletter.

but you know what canada could make? a canadian app store. that’s a store that canadian software authors could use to sell canadian apps to canadian customers, charging, say, the standard payment processing fee of 5% rather than apple’s 30%. canada could make app stores for the android, playstation and xbox, too.

there’s no reason that a canadian app store would have to confine itself to canadian software authors, either. canadian app stores could offer 5% commissions on sales to us and global software authors, and provide jailbreaking kits that allows device owners all around the world to install the canadian app stores where software authors don’t get ripped off by american big tech companies.

the weight of a feather (the weight of a heart)
january 26, 2025 / cory doctorow / a place so foreign and eight more, down and out in the magic kingdom, eastern standard tribe, news, overclocked, podcast, reviews, someone comes to town, someone leaves town, stories, walkaway
 



this week on my podcast, i’m reading “the weight of a feather (the weight of a heart),” my short story in harlan ellison’s the last dangerous visions, commissioned by j. michael straczynski.

margaret came into my office, breaking my unproductive clicktrance. she looked sheepish. “i got given one of those robots that follows you around,” she said. she took a step, revealing the waist-high reinforced cardboard box. “want to help unbox?

i stood up and unkinked my spine and hips and shoulders with a sound like wringing out a sheet of bubble-wrap. “oof.”

“come on, old fella,” she said. she handed me a box-cutter.

enshittification isn’t caused by venture capital
january 20, 2025 / cory doctorow / a place so foreign and eight more, down and out in the magic kingdom, eastern standard tribe, news, overclocked, podcast, someone comes to town, someone leaves town
 



this week on my podcast, i’m reading “enshittification isn’t caused by venture capital,” the latest post from my pluralistic.net blog. it’s about the new “free our feeds” project and why i think the existence of mastodon doesn’t mean we shouldn’t pay attention to making bluesky as free as possible.

when tech critics fail to ask why good services turn bad, that failure is just as severe as the failure to ask why people stay when the services rot.

now, the guy who ran facebook when it was a great way to form communities and make friends and find old friends is the same guy who who has turned facebook into a hellscape. there’s very good reason to believe that mark zuckerberg was always a creep, and he took investment capital very early on, long before he started fucking up the service. so what gives? did zuck get a brain parasite that turned him evil? did his investors get more demanding in their clamor for dividends?

if that’s what you think, you need to show your working. again, by all accounts, zuck was a monster from day one. zuck’s investors – both the vcs who backed him early and the gigantic institutional funds whose portfolios are stuffed with meta stock today – are not patient sorts with a reputation for going easy on entrepreneurs who leave money on the table. they’ve demanded every nickel since the start.

what changed? what caused zuck to enshittify his service? and, even more importantly for those of us who care about the people locked into facebook’s walled gardens: what stopped him from enshittifying his services in the “good old days?”

picks and shovels chapter one
january 10, 2025 / cory doctorow / down and out in the magic kingdom, eastern standard tribe, news, overclocked, podcast, red team blues, someone comes to town, someone leaves town, the bezzle
 



this week on my podcast, i’ve got wil wheaton reading the first chapter of the audiobook of picks and shovels, the next martin hench novel, which is out next month. please consider supporting my work by pre-ordering the book as a hardcover, drm-free ebook, or drm-free audiobook in my kickstarter!

the year is 1986. the city is san francisco. here, martin hench will invent the forensic accountant–what a bounty hunter is to people, he is to money–but for now he’s an mit dropout odd-jobbing his way around a city still reeling from the invention of a revolutionary new technology that will change everything about crime forever, one we now take completely for granted.

when marty finds himself hired by silicon valley pc startup fidelity computing to investigate a group of disgruntled ex-employees who’ve founded a competitor startup, he quickly realizes he’s on the wrong side. marty ditches the greasy old guys running fidelity computing without a second thought, utterly infatuated with the electric atmosphere of computing freedom. located in the heart of the mission, this group of brilliant young women found themselves exhausted by the predatory business practices of fidelity computing and set out to beat them at their own game, making better computers and driving fidelity computing out of business. but this optimistic startup, fueled by young love and california-style burritos, has no idea the depth of the evil they’re seeking to unroot or the risks they run.

in this company-eat-company city, martin and his friends will be lucky to escape with their lives.

spill, part six (finale) (a little brother story)
december 8, 2024 / cory doctorow / a place so foreign and eight more, down and out in the magic kingdom, eastern standard tribe, little brother, news, overclocked, podcast, someone comes to town, someone leaves town
 



this week on my podcast, i read the sixth and final installment of “spill“, a new little brother story commissioned by clay f carlson and published on reactor, the online publication of tor books. also available in drm-free ebook form as a tor original. spill will be reprinted in allen kaster’s 2025 year’s best sf on earth.

i didn’t plan to go to oklahoma, but i went to oklahoma.

my day job is providing phone tech support to people in offices who use my boss’s customer-relationship management software. in theory, i can do that job from anywhere i can sit quietly on a good internet connection for a few hours a day while i’m on shift. it’s a good job for an organizer, because it means i can go out in the field and still pay my rent, so long as i can park a rental car outside of a starbucks, camp on their wifi, and put on a noise-canceling headset. it’s also good organizer training because most of the people who call me are angry and confused and need to have something difficult and technical explained to them.

my comrades started leaving for oklahoma the day the water protector camp got set up. a lot of them—especially my indigenous friends—were veterans of the line 3 pipeline, the dakota access pipeline, and other pipeline fights, and they were plugged right into that network.

the worse things got, the more people i knew in ok. my weekly affinity group meeting normally had twenty people at it. one week there were only ten of us. the next week, three. the next week, we did it on zoom (ugh) and most of the people on the line were in ok, up on “facebook hill,” the one place in the camp with reliable cellular data signals.
