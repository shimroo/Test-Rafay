everything you’ve ever learned about marketing is wrong.
what if everything you’ve ever heard, everything you’ve ever tried, and everything you’ve ever done is all wrong?
most people don’t understand this simple marketing truth: marketing’s job is to facilitate the prospect’s decision-making process and get them to say…
“i would have to be an absolute fool to do business with anyone else but you – regardless of price.”
do your advertisements, brochures, websites, etc., do that? do you want them to?
