important changes for how minors access the library collections at north shelby library and mt laurel library




what has changed?

the policies governing library membership and access for minors (17 and under) to the different library collections has changed. minors will only be allowed to check out materials in youth departments (children and teen). parents and legal guardians will be required to sign a waiver to give their minor access to all collections within north shelby and mt laurel libraries.



when do these changes take effect?

where can i view the new policies?

all policies are available on the library website: https://northshelbylibrary.org/library-policies/
library collections policy



who is responsible for these changes?

after new state legislation the alabama public library service (apls) changed its administrative code which provides the requirements to receive state aid funds to local libraries. north shelby library’s board of trustees amended the policies to the meet the apls code change requirements.



what do my child and i need to do to use the library?

parents and legal guardians must choose between 2 levels of access for their minors: 1. juvenile and teen collections or 2. all access includes all collections in the library.

as of february 1, all juvenile library cards will be restricted. to convert a restricted card to an all-department card, the parent/guardian must visit the library in person.
the parent/guardian must present photo id, and sign a waiver form.
the parent/guardian must be a current library cardholder at north shelby or mt laurel libraries
