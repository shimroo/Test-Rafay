about us
young fine gael (yfg) is the politically autonomous yet integral youth wing of the fine gael party, maintaining its independence to advance political representation and objectives of the youth of ireland through the vehicle of fine gael.
we are committed to our shared values of the fine gael party: equality of opportunity, enterprise and reward, safety and security in our society, while insisting integrity and ambition are at the core of our actions. yfg has local branches in every d√°il constituency and college branches in third level institutions on the island of ireland.
the yfg constitution and rules is amended and endorsed at every young fine gael national conference. the most recent iteration was adopted at the 2023 conference.
