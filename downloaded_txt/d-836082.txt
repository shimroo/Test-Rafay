ten years ago today
[oct. 4th, 2007|05:17 pm]
lisaporter




keeping my memories alivedear all:ten years ago today lisa and i were married in a beautiful church located on the grounds of trinity school. this was the chapel that lisa knew from her school days. the church where she had always dreamed of getting married. it could not have been a more fitting location. we said our vows to each other. we had memorized them. and they were probably only audible to us since they were said through tears of joy. the ceremony was followed by a reception at the candle light inn. lisa, absolutely the most beautiful bride, and i danced our first dance to elvis's song: i can't help falling in love. this had been our song since a late night at the harrisonburg waffle house when i played ub40's version on the juke box and sang it to lisa. as much as i did not want a relationship at the time, i simply could not help falling in love with her. i have always described our wedding day and event as being just perfect--classy, quaint and charming. it was a day that lisa and i both enjoyed immensely. after the reception we drove to our new apartment in elkridge, took showers and took a nap. we then drove to columbia mall to buy hiking boots because we left mine in my best man's truck, and we had big plans of hiking the lush green islands in the caribbean. the following two weeks did in fact include sailing the blue seas under radiant sunsets and billowing sails, and hiking among lush vegetation on the most remote islands of the caribbean sea.i share with you some of these memories because i want to keep them alive. i am again happy and very much in love. but i will always love lisa, what we had, and i will always miss it. the following is an excerpt from lisa's journal in which she talked about our last anniversary that we shared together october 2005:_____________________________________________________________bill’s parents (fred and jean) drove up from fredericksburg, va friday evening in order to be here for the komen rftc early saturday morning and stayed for the rest of the weekend. they gave us two beautiful crepe myrtle trees (which i have always wanted) for our anniversary present (which is on oct. 4th). fred (who is quite the gardener) and bill planted them and they look wonderful. thank you both so much!what else is going on?  well. . . here's the report on our anniversary celebration.  saturday we dropped the kids off with my parents (thanks mom and dad) at dinnertime and headed off to a new steakhouse in historic ellicott city called jordan's steakhouse.  we drive right by it every time we go to st. agnes.  their front window has a table for two in it with upholstered cushy chairs.  i have always said that if we ever ate there, i would want to sit in the window.  well. . . my wonderful husband had arranged for that to happen and it was super!  the table was great -- it was fun to people-watch out the window at the shoppers as we chatted and ate.  the food was incredible!  i had marinated flank steak with mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  bill  had something called a cowboy steak, whatever that is.  he enjoyed it immensely.  dessert was creme brulee for bill (one of his favorites) and the best tiramisu i've ever had for me.  it was a wonderful meal.  what made it even more wonderful is my incredible husband.  he gave me my anniversary gift at dinner (which i wasn't expecting because he had told me he had to order it and it wasn't in yet).  it is the most beautiful diamond anniversary band i've ever seen.  he hand-picked each of the diamonds himself.  he actually got down on one knee and proposed to me all over again!  so. . . we're getting married again!  we'll be renewing our vows in the next few months and having a big party afterwards!  i'll let you all know when we set the date.__________________________________________________________well, i am planning on visiting lisa's gravesite this evening, lighting a candle and leaving some flowers. and i'll probably sip a beer as well.my love to all of you who have helped me survive too. by the way, the crepe myrtle trees planted for our last anniversary are absolutely beautiful this year and have bloomed like you cannot even imagine.bill

back to living

[mood
|rejuvenated]to all, this is a long overdue update. it has taken me a little while to feel up to getting back onto the website. i read the entries here and there, but i just have not had the ability to actually get on and add to it. i'm not sure how many people still check the site, but i run across a friend every so often who tells me they still check in. the kids and i are getting along pretty well. it goes without saying that we have our rough days, but we are managing and moving through life. i still find myself in disbelief as to what all happened. i still cannot believe lisa actually died. but, we are doing okay. for me, i think i have come to realize that life does go on. and we are finding happiness again. and lisa's memory remains alive within all of us. i thank everyone who has stuck with my family since the beginning. your support made all the difference. i hope that my failure to keep in touch with a lot of you does not make you feel as if i do not appreciate you. it has just taken some time to get back to living again. but we are back. still recovering, but back. a few months ago our church posted a sign near the entrance reading: "god does not promise a safe journey, but only a safe arrival." how true it is. this update will be the last i am going to enter. i had every intention of keeping it going, but i need to move ahead and keep working to get beyond it all. i will never forget what i learned from lisa and our journey. i will never forget any of you and what you did to give us the hope and support to tackle each day. and i will never forget lisa. her memory will always be a part of me. lisa did survive. and we are okay. my love to you all.

trying
[jun. 8th, 2006|11:11 pm]

to all,i made a commitment to myself and lisa to keep the site going with updates. it has been hard to do. i just have not felt the drive to sit down and go over everything again. i think about it all the time, but i don't feel the ability to express myself the way i did at one time. i feel sad. it all seems so unbelievable. i cannot believe lisa died. i'm a single parent. unbelievable. i'm living what i feared since her diagnosis, and knew deep down could happen, but never really expected to happen. i am back to work now and trying to work into a routine. i use a curl iron to curl katie's hair. i fix lunches and lay out clothes the night before. i wake up before the kids and get dressed, get breakfast ready, get the kids up, dress them and dash them out the door to school, usually behind time. i rush to work and usually feel a step behind what i'm supposed to complete and accomplish. i rush to preschool graduations from work. i plan playdates. i keep the house neat and the laundry clean; rarely folded, but clean. i fix dinner and give baths. read bedtime stories. and then i have my time. time that used to be shared.as a father, i should have always done this stuff. i did a lot. but i never did it alone. even when lisa was really sick, i had her help in so many ways that i never realized. i had a companion. a partner. someone to talk to and watch tv with after the kids went to bed. someone to share my day with and my personal feelings and frustrations. i had someone to love in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. a comfort zone in social settings. i had the love and understanding that comes from a spouse. i did not intend to get on here and go on like this. but this is part of my day and it is all i think about when i have time to sit and think. sure i remember the good days. i relish those days. the memories of very important times in the last few weeks i had with lisa. but i so miss those days. where did they go, and go so fast? it is the loneliness that puts a dark cloud over my head and in my heart. i am blessed with lots of family and many friends. i was blessed to have had lisa. i do not find it a blessing that i no longer have her however, and that my children no longer have her. am i angry? yes. sad? yes. do i think that i will make it? yes i do. but i know it is going to take time. lots of time. time that i would rather be spending with lisa. i am trying to do what hospice suggested, and be "gentle" with myself. but there is nothing gentle about the way i feel, the hole in my heart, the quake in the life that i thought i was going to have and the life i thought we were going to give our children. i am done for now. i promise, to you, lisa and myself, that my next entry will be about a happy time that lisa and i shared in her last month or so. i will tell you about easter. what a glorious day, one i will never forget. one of the last times that i really remember lisa not being confused and really and truly a happy person who believed that she was going to get well. what a great day that we were blessed with. i promise to give you the details of that happy day. next time.  all my love. and thanks for the support. regardless of how much i miss lisa and how sad i am about what happened, a day does not go by that i am not thankful for those persons still here in my life. every one of you who helps me and my kids make it through the day.

thursday, may 11, 2006 update
[may. 11th, 2006|11:53 pm]
lisaporter




to all,i feel as if i've been doing pretty good the past couple days. yesterday i cleaned up the grave site and i added two more potted plants. so lisa now has four flowering plants decorating her place of rest. after picking up the kids from school we walked over to spend some time with lisa. the kids liked the flowers and we sat in the grass next to lisa wrestling, tickling and talking for about an hour. it helps me and i hope it helps the kids to know that we can go see lisa so easily. and i hope that they feel a spiritual connection to her as well. i am still working on finding that connection, but have faith that it will come. the kids and i picked out a headstone on monday. they helped choose it. andrew of course was insistent on getting a black in color shiny granite. he gave into a more traditional gray granite with a little urging from me. both katie and andrew wanted flowers and butterflies engraved on it. so with their help we picked out stargazer lilies and there will be butterflies flittering around lisa's name. i think i am going to call the company back and ask them to add something personal to it for me---something like "you will always fly me to the moon" or simply "wp + lp". it takes about 90 days for the headstone to be complete.we are hitting mother's day head on. both katie and andrew have been making mother's day projects at school and i prepared them for this. they are each making gifts that they can take to the grave site. we have decided that we are going to go to church on sunday as usual and then we are going to have a tea party at lisa's grave, with momma. since there is no headstone yet, we are also going to put a garden flag there to help decorate the site. this is kind of tough to even write, but we are going to get through it and be okay. i went to the parent orientation at katie's elementary school tonight. she starts kindergarten at lenton springs in the fall. what a beautiful school. i know lisa would be proud. i so truly wished that lisa could have been there with me tonight. school was always such a big thing for lisa. she could tell you every teacher she ever had from preschool through college. she could tell you where she sat in the classroom and who all the students were in the class with her. lisa used to love the "back to school" smell in the air every fall. one year i took her out to walmart and we bought a bunch of school supplies just so she could join in the back to school fun. i used to tell lisa that she was the smartest person i know. she really was. she just knew everything.i was very grateful to lisa's mom and dad who went with me to the parent orientation. i did not feel so alone there. for the most part, there were mothers there. i think i'll head up the pta some year! by the way, when we were in the school it started to pour rain. it was the type of spring rain that really just cleanses everything. it was the type of rain that lisa would have loved. i wondered if it was lisa's presence during this time that she would want to be present. i have never liked the rain. i could never stand to get wet and then have to sit around in wet clothes sticking to me. lisa, however, absolutely loved the rain. before she passed, she told me that she was going to come back as the rain so that i would learn to love it. well let me tell you, if it is a sign of lisa, then let it rain. i'll manage getting wet. maybe i'll even get drenched. i had a couple friends over from church this evening and we just talked. i felt pretty good until they left around 10:30 pm. it is the times in the evening when i am alone that i start thinking about lisa and how much i miss her. it is good to be by yourself and it is good to "think" even when the thinking hurts. but it helps me to keep my thought organized. hence i am down here writing. as i mentioned before i want to relay some of the events that occurred around the time that lisa went into st. agnes on march 24th. that week had been a real trial for both of us; especially physically for her and emotionally for me. lisa had been having a lot of lower back and pelvic pain (which i think she wrote about in one of her last entries). anyway, she had several tests to try to determine the cause of the pain. most of the tests were mris and cat scans of various parts along the spine. she also had a pet scan and most upsetting was the spinal tap (or lumbar puncture as they called it).the lumbar puncture was on the monday and it required lisa to lay on a table kind of in a fetal position. the position itself was extremely painful for her. using a needle they then took a fair amount of spinal fluid from inside her spine. after the procedure lisa had to lay flat on her back to allow the puncture to heal properly. after laying there uncomfortably for about an hour lisa was allowed to get up and go to the restroom. this was the most excruciating part of the test. mentally excruciating. it was where we started to realize exactly how debiliated lisa had become. i had to help lisa in the restroom; with her clothing, helping her sit down and stand up. when she stood up, lisa started crying and saying how unfair all of this was. she said she was tired of hurting and was tired of being tired. this was probably the only time that lisa ever got really upset about all that she was going through. it was at this time that i seemed to find the strength to comfort her. i just held her and assured her that i was going to be there for her through everything. i confirmed for her how strong and how beautiful she was. i assured her of our love that cancer could not beat us. it was a tough day and a tough situation. oddly enough, on a side note, that same night i met with rw who lost his wife to cancer two months prior to lisa's diagnosis. rw was my same age with young children just like us. his wife was lisa's age and she had been treated at st. agnes by lisa's oncologist.come friday morning, march 24, after many tests with no results, lisa's pain had gotten extremely worse. i had taken the kids to school and returned home. lisa was laying on our bed in tears trying to find a position in which to get comfortable. there was no comfortable position for her. i asked her what her pain number was, and she advised that she would say a "10" except that she knew it would get worse. i contacted the cancer center and was advised that we would be meeting with the oncologist the following week. it was at this time that lisa told me that she did not think she was going to make it through the weekend. she told me she thought for certain she was going to die. i again called the cancer center and they advised me to bring her to the hospital. they already had her admitted and the room was waiting for her. so i took her to st. agnes where they began trying to get a grip on the pain and the cause of it. it was on march 24, 2006, that i took her to st. agnes and a lot of feelings passed between us between then and april 29, 2006. as i feel the energy i am going to continue to go through this period of time and extract many of those times that led me to the hospice decision and the ultimate confidence i had in my faith and our love. there were many loving conversations shared during this time. these are the times that i try to remember when i start to ask why it all happened. i hope to never forget these special life-changing times.more to come...

a better day
[may. 9th, 2006|10:54 pm]
lisaporter




today was much better than yesterday. my mother-in-law (joan) took the kids this morning and i went back to bed for several hours. the extra sleep did me some good i think. i have read all the responses to my latest post. and have received a great amount of comfort from them. there will be tough times ahead, but i am so appreciative to have friends to help me along the way. i will not lose my faith. it is through my faith that i will be able to keep lisa a part of me. in the next several days i hope to have a little bit of time to post some of the conversations that i had with lisa during the month prior to her passing. many of those conversations helped me find the peace i needed to let her go. i find a large amount strength from remembering those times. the past month was so full of different feelings and sharing that i really want to get them into the journal before i forget them.thanks for the help and support.

empty

i'm making my first attempt to keep the journal going. i wish i could get on and tell everyone how great i have been feeling. but all i feel is empty. i miss lisa so much. i feel like i was so ready for this when i made the plans to get her home. but it all happened so fast. too fast. i wish i could have had just one more conversation with her. we talked about her dying while she was able to do so. i felt so certain that she would always be a part of my life, even if only spiritually. i thought that maybe i would even feel more connected to her. but i don't. i'm looking for her in everything. the sky, the grass, the flowers. trying to find a small something that will tell me she is here. but i can't seem to find it and i miss her. i need her so much. dying is so final. there had better be more to this somewhere and somehow.

reference the children
[may. 4th, 2006|11:02 am]
lisaporter




to all,katie and andrew are doing very well since lisa's passing. night time is the hardest time for them and they often ask for her and cry. so far i have been able to assure them that momma is in heaven and that her heart and soul will always be a part of them, just as she is always looking over them. with this said, i have decided that i am not going to bring katie and andrew to the visitation today. they saw their momma minutes before and seconds after she passed away on saturday. they both laid in the bed next to her and said their goodbyes in their terms. i think that seeing her today, once again, could add confusion to their understanding that momma is no longer here, but that she is always looking down at us from heaven.both katie and andrew have picked out a couple teddy bears each for me to lay in the casket with lisa and a couple favorite books as well.i am sending this out so that many of you who were planning to bring school friends out of support for katie and andrew will not be disappointed. they will be at the funeral service on friday and this will not change. i guess i'll see most of you in a couple hours...thanks for the support and love that is helping to keep lisa's spirit alive, and my heart from sinking.bill

april 28, 2006 update
[apr. 28th, 2006|10:16 pm]
lisaporter




to all,i am forcing myself to provide this update. as i've said before, lisa would want you to know. you have been with her from day one of her journey. you deserve the right to remain involved.lisa's life here is quickly coming to an end. she is no longer responsive, she has constant fevers and her breathing is quick and shallow. despite the supplemental oxygen she struggles for each breath. despite the morphine, she suffers a lot of pain anytime she is moved. her dreams still seem to be vivid based on the occasional moan, but she is no longer agitated or active during them. she is no longer able to swallow so her medications have been cut back to only the morphine and ativan. she has not had anything to eat or drink for several days now.my prayers continue to be that she be allowed to cross over easily and peacefully into the next life. however, her instinct to fight, keep her from making the final transition. it is as if she is clinging to this world with only one finger. but she is slowly slipping. and that is okay, because she is ready. for me, i continue to be ready, but i'm liking it less and less the closer she gets. and the only reason i'm ready is because this horrible disease, which i refuse to even type the name of, has destroyed her in so many ways. it has changed her physically; it has hurt her physically and emotionally; it has taken away her mobility; it has taken away her independence; and it is now taking away her life. but it has not taken her spirit. it has not won. lisa is the victor in this battle and she has been since december 6, 2004, when she was given the news that changed our lives forever. forever better and forever worse. so i am going back upstairs to sit with my beautiful wife and hold her hand for as long as i can.like you, i'm going to miss her. our family is going to have an empty hole in it. but lisa's spirit and memories will fill it, and we will also survive.love and blessings,bill
