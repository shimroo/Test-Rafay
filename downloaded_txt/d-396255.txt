                                        my sister sent me a picture of the flowers she received and they were absolutely beautiful! they were even more beautiful than i imagined. i had same day delivery and it went great! flowers were delivered on time. i've used xavier florists before and i'm always so thrilled with them. i live across u.s. so it's nice to know i can trust in a great florist!

                                        was very impressed with your service 
you went above and beyond. you made a special delivery since the flower order hadn't been delivered when i called to confirm a delivery of the order.
my sister loved the flower arrangement she received. 
thank you
