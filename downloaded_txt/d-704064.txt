this is it - we have moved our blog!





this time it really happened.we are now live with the new unyg blog.many of our long time blogger blog readers might not have ever even see the official upstate new york genealogy website at www.unyg.com but that site was built and has a ton of information on it for ny state genealogy research and it was created before this blog was on google's blogger platform.we were lucky when we set up the main website that the four letter domain name was available and it should make it very easy to remember because upstate new york genealogy = unyg.com.now the new blog is just an extension of the main website and all future blog posts will be on the new site at www.unyg.com/blog.when you go to the new site remember to use either the rss or the email the subscribe method to be kept informed of all future posts on the new unyg blog.   there are thousands of people subscribed to the old blog but in order to be assured that you will know of new posts you should subscribe again, and of course as with all of our posts and writings, it is free! a big thak you to all of our readers and we look forward to servicg you all with many new pieces of information to help you find those pesky upstate new yor ancestors.dick hillenbrandyou may experience a few glitches for a few days until we fumigate all the bugs but it will work perfectly after a little while.thanks for reading.come visit us at the new blog site and please leave comments or ask questions.new york state vital records -revolutionary war patriot or loyalist -world war ii soldier's grave cared for in holland -visit our main website at www.unyg.com

new events coming to unyg blog





well we finally will see a new website associated with this blog.  it is still being tested and loaded up with content.we are working on building the new site now and soon you will be reading this blog on a new platform.  as many of our long time readers know, the upstate new york genealogy website and then blog evolved over the past nine or so years.we actually had an earlier website on a free webhosting platform that was called nygenes.  that is why it seemed only natural to set up my email address as nygenes at gmail.com.  the internet has changed greatly since i started publishing genealogy information over a dozen years ago.the new platform, (website to be announced real soon now,) will have a much nicer look and feel than having to use this pre-made template that blogger supplies.  we will also have a better method to handle categories and subjects, and will be able to offer you specials on certain products that we all need to do research with.i thank google for the free use of the blogger platform as without it i would have never met so many of you nice people who have been following my rants and ramblings. so a very big thank you goes out to all of you as well.the new website url will be very easy to remember and we will have it posted prominently right here on this blog platform which will remain up for an undetermined time period.  it will be very easy to find the new blog.so again, thanks and stay tuned for the new blog platform for upstate new york genealogy blog.  coming soon!ps: we will also have some nice new gifts and contest prizes to reward you as loyal followers.dick hillenbrandnew york state vital records -revolutionary war patriot or loyalist -world war ii soldier's grave cared for in holland -visit our main website at www.unyg.com
