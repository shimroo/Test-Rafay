research
on these families has been done mainly by caroline bamber and richard ball with help from: dorothy williams and clive stonestreet.tom ball has contributed the ball family of new zealand and pam
robins has contributed the sargent family of hastings.keith durno has provided the information on the durno family and harry adkins that on the present day adkins family.ken
martin has provided the great deal of information on the descendants of richard ball in the usa.donald reid provided the information on the fysh family of australia and peter
earl that on the descendants of robert johnson fysh of king's lynn.david thwaites has contributed information on the thwaites family in canada.we
have done our best to piece together the evidence available but almost everywhere we wish there were more evidence.so
many people seem to be born without there being any more evidence - for others we are unable to find birth or baptism details and have to deduce connections from wills (a very good source) or family names (chancey) or other evidence.if
anyone has any corrections to make or people or branches to add we would be very glad to hear from them.meanwhile
we hope that making our work available may help someone somewhere to make a connection they may be struggling with.if
you do think that your family connects to any of these branches we would be happy to check the evidence with you and include your family on this site or provide a link to yours.the
