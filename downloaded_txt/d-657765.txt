what people are saying






today was the best inservice day in my 31 years with knox county schools.  usually, i sit watching the clock waiting to leave. when you first spoke, it was evident of your spiritual being.  you are so motivating. i have been so inspired on a personal level.  with sincere gratitude i thank you for being in my corner.  you are my people.
-bunny, knox county school, teacher

i am truly grateful to you. thank you for making such a huge difference!  your presentations were amazing.  i have received so much positive feedback.  looking forward to working with you in the future!
