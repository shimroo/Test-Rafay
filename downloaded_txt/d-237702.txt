											how do i know which way the bedsheet goes on my bed?
									 	

putting bedsheets on correctly
using a permanent marker, make an x on the back part of the sheet that hangs down. now when putting the sheets on, just look for the x and you'll know immediately which way it goes.

where and when to find discounted bedding
when shopping for bedding, you might want to look for discounted bedding in order to save quite a few bucks. you could, of course, waste a ton of valuable time and gas money going from store to store comparing sale prices, but who really wants to do that? besides, doing that usually means that you really haven't saved any money by the time you figure in time and gas expenses.
luckily, there is another way to find discounted bedding without as much hassle. look online and compare prices instead. many websites offer excellent selections of bedding at discount prices. even your favorite stores sometimes offer discount prices and sales online that they do not offer in the actual store itself.

down blankets are the stuff!
during the winter and fall months cold bitter winds combined with cold wet snow can make for a cold miserable day. coming home after being out in the cold, most people reach for one of three things, a hot drink, dry clothes, and a warm blanket. 
to stay warm and cozy during these frigid times make sure you have a quality down blanket. these blankets are filled with small, lightweight, virtually waterproof feathers and can keep a person very warm. once you are under the covers the feathers begin to warm you up by conducting heat. as your body heat warms the feathers, they in turn warm each other, and as a result, you. this is much the same way birds keep warm. 
down blankets come in all shapes, sizes, and colors so it should be relatively easy to find one that fits your needs and expectations. 
whatever type of down blanket you buy, make sure that the material it is made of is tightly woven enough so that the down inside does not leak out. anyone who has ever owned one of these blankets can tell you, down is a sneaky thing and even though you may not see any holes, it will still get out.

how to buy the perfect bedding set
there are many different bedding sets available on the market today. gone are the days when the only choices were hard, harder and hardest as the type of bedding set you could choose from. today there are many different bedding materials available and many, many different manufacturers.
before you begin to even shop at stores for a bedding set, you might consider spending time online to look at all the different kinds of bedding sets that are available. spend time looking at the different manufacturer websites and look at the different types of construction that you have to choose from.
for example, different types of sleepers have different types of sleeping needs. if you are a side-sleeper, then you most likely enjoy a softer bed. latex beds are some of the softest types of beds available on the market today. however, if you are a back-sleeper, you might enjoy are harder bed and a traditional coil spring bed might be just the ticket for you.
in many cases, people shift frequently when they sleep. if you are someone that sleeps on both your back and your sides and then shifts to your stomach, you may find that the most comfortable bed for you is a bed that will shift and change with you during the night. in this case, you might prefer an adjustable bed with an inner air coil.
no matter what type of sleeper you are, once you have an idea of what types of beds there are available for your sleep style, then you will be ready to go to the store and start trying out different types of bedding sets. soon you will be sleeping in the comfort of your own home in your new bedding set.

so tell me about extra long twin bedding
go to any dorm room or institution and you will most likely find extra long twin beds. an extra long twin bed is usually around 39 inches wide and 80 inches long. you will of course need special or extra long twin bedding to go on this type of bed. it’s a great thing they make beds this size as they fit most anyone. finding bedding for them though can be a pain. but don’t worry. make sure you know that standard twin bedding will not fit a bed like this so don't even try. you can find extra long twin bedding at most nicer department stores. sometimes they are hidden in the shelves or pushed to the back simply because there aren’t always a lot of them. know also that your selection may be limited but don’t worry they are in demand at some level and you can find them. if for some reason you can’t find the extra long twin bedding you like in a store you for sure can go online and choose from maybe an even better selection. the cost for extra long twin bedding isn’t usually much higher than standard twin bedding either. it is sometimes a good idea to buy the sheets and bedspread or comforter in a set. that way you know you are getting the right size and as a bonus they will match.

what are bed sheet straps?
very simply put, bed sheet straps are the things that attach to the fitted sheet at the four corners of a bed so that the sheet will not come loose and slip off. this is a very useful invention. they go by quite a few names. some of the names are suspenders, clips or grabbers. below are a few tips on explaining some of the different types. 
1. bed sheet straps that are called suspenders look like a great big “x” on the underside of your mattress with clips or hooks on each end (an example of what it looks like-a child wearing suspenders to hold their pants up. there is that crisscross on their back.) after your fitted sheet is placed on the bed, pull up each corner just enough to grab hold of the end of the suspender that has the hook on it and attach it to your sheet corner. this will keep the sheet secure.
2. another name for bed sheet straps is clips. there are four clips and each one attaches to the each of the end corners of the bed, holding the sheet secure.
3. grabbers have a piece of elastic about three inches long and at the ends they have a clip. the clips attach underneath the bed corners pulling the sheet tight.
these tips should help get you started on deciding what kind of bed sheet straps would work best for you.
