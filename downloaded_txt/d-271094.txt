cryptography programming

we maintain a detailed cryptography software page with useful free cryptographic software code
and various articles on cryptography.
the free code includes the blowfish algorithm in vb6 and 
the mysecret command-line freeware encryption utility.
the articles include
our page on the rsa algorithm including the 
theory and proof of the rsa algorithm,
and various how-to pages such as 
using keys in cryptography,
using padding in encryption,
encryption with international character sets, and
cross-platform encryption.
we also publish cryptography-related articles on mathematics.

cryptosys products

we sell two commercial cryptographic products under the cryptosystm brand name:
cryptosys api and 
cryptosys pki pro.
cryptosys api is a library of symmetrical cryptography tools
and cryptosys pki pro provides
public key encryption and digital signatures. 
firmasat
is a separate product to create and read digital receipts specifically
for the tax administration service in mexico (sat). 

there are interfaces for programmers in
vba/vb6, vb.net/vb2005/vb20xx, c/c++, c#, java and python.

...more details →

consulting

we can provide consulting services on implementing cryptography in your programs. 
in particular, we are happy to provide detailed programming help with implementing 
cryptosys api and the  
cryptosys pki toolkit.

...more details →

general computer programming
just need someone to cut some code?
our founder david ireland, gssp-c, has many years experience in programming in a variety of languages,
including c, visual basic, microsoft access, c#, perl and python.

for more details of our experience, see
profile and
projects.


we enjoy doing complex algorithms and arcane problems. 
if we can't do it, we'll tell you up-front, so as not to waste your time.
we only start jobs we know we can finish.
...more details →

see our page on the c programming language
where we've assembled links and copies of interesting or educational articles on c programming, 
look at windows win32 programming, and consider why we still prefer ansi c to c++.

examples

wclock is a free, customisable, always-on-top world time clock for windows computers. 
the source code is provided.
bigdigits is a free library of multiple-precision arithmetic routines written in ansi c to carry out large natural number calculations.

bdcalc, our command-line calculator and mini-programming language for large natural numbers.

dbxanalyzertm 
reads, analyses and manages email data files created by microsoft outlook express 5 and 6.
it has a simple gui interface and is used by hundreds of happy users worldwide to recover and manage their old outlook express emails.

2014-05-31: now available for free.

our  su doku solver was written in excel vba back in 2004 when the "fiendish" puzzles were 
first introduced by the times. 
this solver will solve almost all su doku problems (and takes away all the fun!).
