what they're saying about us...
our guests have some great things to say about us.







everything was amazing. my family came up to visit for a few hours and wanted to know how they could also rent this property for future use. i guess it’s safe to say that this will be a family favorite. so much space. great view of the beach. the host was very friendly and their response time was immaculate. i will most definitely be back and i will most definitely use this property again.

elliot r.





we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend getaway! the staff was really helpful even though we booked at the last minute. the condo was beautiful, clean, and affordable! we will definitely be staying again!
