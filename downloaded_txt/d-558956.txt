about
audreyhacking.com was created in july of 2001. it was created to facilitate the fledgeling 3com audrey hacking community. it was a very popular hacking site and was featured on slashdot, forums and other popular sites. we even succeeded in getting an honorable mention for the 2002 prix ars electronicaÂ : net vision.
