testimonialsannie is my realtor.  what i mean by this statement is that when i need to sell or purchase real estate in the future annie is my go-to.  annie is kind, thorough, smart, focused, pleasant to be with and funny.  what a catch!-maura tillotson 11/29/23
just want to give a shout out and a big thank you to annie allen. we sold my land in surry.  she was so pleasant to work with and i enjoyed our conversations.  she made everything so easy and explained everything to me as we went along. she has a good sense of humor which i appreciated.   i would definitely recommend her to anyone interested in buying or selling in that area. she gets 5 stars from me.  thanks annie, you are wonderful.   -donna walton 10/6/23
i am a first time home buyer and tina walked me through every step of the process and was incredibly kind and patient! she went to bat for me several times as well, and was able to get services moved ahead or changed so that the process went as smoothly as possible. i really enjoyed working with her.- dustin 7/22/22
my family certainly benefitted from marty's professionalism and many years in the business. she was a great advocate for us and pursued all possible options for selling my parents' home. i felt very well cared for and her advice was spot on. definitely recommend her and/or use her for any other real estate work.     - kim anne 02/17/2022
happy holidays to you too, annie! we think of you often when we consider the huge blessing of the property we have & how thankful we are that we had someone as honest & pleasant as you to work with! happy new year!     - patty & dave 12/27/21
