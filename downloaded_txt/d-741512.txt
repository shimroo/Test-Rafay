crazy black "nuwaubian" cult







the nuwaubian nation or nuwaubian movement (over the years known as "ansaru allah community", "holy tabernacle ministries", "united nuwaubian nation of moors", and "yamassee native american moors of the creek nation"), is a religious organization founded and led by malachi (dwight) york. 

it is classed as a hate group by southern poverty law center. 

york began founding black muslim groups in new york in 1967, and has changed his teachings and the names of his groups many times. in the late 1980s, he abandoned the "muslim" flavour of his movement in favour of ancient egypt and extraterrestrial themes, in 1993 leaving brooklyn for eatonton, putnam county, georgia, where he built an egypt-themed compound called tama-re. by 2000, the "united nuwaubian nation of moors" had some 500 adherents, and drew as many as 5,000 visitors attending "savior's day" (york's birthday). 

but adherence declined steeply after founder dwight york was sentenced to 135 years in federal prison in april 2004 for child molestation. the tama-re compound was sold under government forfeiture and demolished in 2005. the movement was highly eclectic and entirely dependent on york's ever-changing pronouncements, described as "an extra-large dose of egyptian schlock, served with a side dish of intergalactic mumbo jumbo" by bill osinski, author of a 2007 book on york and his arrest and eventual conviction. york's writings and pronouncements over the years combined ideas from a wide range of new age, esotericism and occultism, pseudoscience, besides basic afrocentrism and black supremacism.
