this is an atempt to gather as much information as

      i know this is not complete and therefore i would request that anyone 
		with any additional information please send it to me. 
i'm working on a comprehensive, and complete list of all of love's 
		tours - past, present and future -- and need a lot of dates, so please 
		take a look and see if you can help me with some. i also need any and 
		all information about setlists if you have any. i have many 
		questions regarding recordings and other things so it would be great

		high moon records

		announces deluxe reissue of












		 


		the final studio album  remastered and redefined

first time 
		ever on cd and digital  11/27/15
back on vinyl 
		after over 40 years  2/19/16


		 available now exclusively to our loyal customers at a special pre-order 
		price$3 off retail price!on high moon record's website. 


		http://highmoonrecords.com/shop

pre-order 
		on itunes:
		
smarturl.it/reeltorealitunes
		(itunes pre-order includes advance download of time is like a river)



rich in 
		soulful, unconventional details, masterful singing, crunchy-guitar rock, 
		straight-up stax-grounded soul, eccentric psychedelia and contemporary 
		funk.  david 
		fricke, 
rolling stone

lee was 
		perfectly at ease stretching the boundaries of his music to encompass 
		the sounds of the world at large.  
npr music


		 


		on november 27 
		high moon records will be reissuing the final studio 
		album from one of rock musics most gifted and enigmatic legends  
		expanded with 12 bonus tracks. available on cd/digital for the first 
		time and back on vinyl after more than 40 years, 
reel to real 
		captures arthur 
		lee and 
love at 
		the peak of their rock/funk/soul powers.



		originally recorded and released in 1974 on rso records, this 
		beautifully packaged, deluxe reissue features vibrant, remastered audio 
		from the original tapes, a 32-page booklet with an illuminating essay by
		rolling stones 
		david fricke, and a trove of candid, unpublished photos. today,
		
time is like a river was 
		released on
		
rolling stone and is now 
		available to listen and share on
		
youtube. the track will be 
		available as an instant download with the pre-order of reel to real on
		
itunes.

		what arthur lee began on loves 
black beauty, 
		he brought to fruition on reel to real. armed with a major label budget 
		and a powerful, intuitive band, he dug deep into the blues, soul, and 
		rock grooves that first inspired him, reaching out to a new audience 
		with his fierce and forward-thinking personal vision. the album features 
		arthurs beloved black 
		beauty band: drummer joe blocker, guitarist melvan 
		whittington, and bassist robert rozelle  who lee referred to as cats 
		who can play funky and rock"  augmented by guitar-ace john sterling and 
		cameo appearances by legendary guitarists harvey mandel and buzzy 
		feiten. 
		 
		to a palette of stinging guitars, explosive brass (arranged by arthur 
		lee), deep funk bass and clavinet, splashes of spacey synthesizer, and 
		dream-team female backing vocals, arthur lee brought his funkiest and 
		most soulful collection of songs, channeling the most visceral vocal 
		performances he ever committed to tape.
		 
high moon records 
		has unearthed 11 revelatory, previously-unreleased tracks from the 
		original sessions, including alternate takes and mixes, live-in-studio 
		rehearsals, and 4 newly-discovered arthur lee originals: do it 
		yourself, i gotta remember, somebody, and you gotta feel it. 
		these songs (three fully-produced rockers, and a spare, imagine-era john 
		lennon-by-way-of sly stone studio sketch) were previously unknown to all 
		but their original participants, and present a major addition to arthur 
		lees catalog. other bonus track highlights include the guitar fury in 
		the extended, alternate mix of busted feet, the eccentric and 
		darkly-comic single mix of you said you would, and an impromptu studio 
		rehearsal of forever changes outtake wonder people (i do wonder). this 
		ultra-rare bonus material fills out the picture of a fearless, agile and 
		very funky ensemble, led by a masterful singer-songwriter at his feral, 
		exultant best.
