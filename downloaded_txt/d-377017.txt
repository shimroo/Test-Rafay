designing for inclusion: making websites accessible
see more.

as of june 21, 2001, us federal agencies must make websites accessible to people with vision impairments, hearing problems, limited dexterity and other disabilities.  section 508, an amendment to the rehabilitation act of 1973, mandates that people with disabilities be given as easy access to government information, including through websites, as anyone else.  organizations not covered under section 508 may need to provide accessible websites under the provisions of the americans with disabilities act (ada), section 504 of the rehabilitation act, or other applicable laws. website accessibility is an international issue: many countries have instituted laws based upon the web content accessibility guidelines (wcag) put forth by the world wide web consortium (w3c).

					what does this mean for the average website owner?    who needs to comply and how do you do it?
