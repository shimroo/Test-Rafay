testimonial 








i learned by experience that gradex was a good company who had many good workers. they worked all the time, caused few problems, were clean, professional and finished the project on time and under budget. this project is complete and it has changed the whole outlook of the city. if i was to do it again, i would hope that gradex, inc. be the general contractor. i would certainly recommend gradex, inc. for consideration on any road or sewer project that would come before the public.
