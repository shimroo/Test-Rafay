used engine and pumpers
 
with a wide variety of used fire equipment and apparatus available on our site, we offer you a lot of choices for buying or selling. online postings can be numerous, and you want to get the best quality product for an affordable price. that's why we make it easy to buy or sell your fire trucks with us.
we sell a range of used fire trucks, including multiple brands and styles to match your fire department's unique needs. when you list with us, we will answer as many questions from potential sellers as possible before passing them on to you. fire departments looking to improve their equipment turn to us to find high-quality used trucks.
if you are ready to sell your used fire truck, we can help you find a buyer and make a deal. we offer multiple types of equipment for buyers and sellers. here are just a few types of trucks for sale on our site.
 
antique fire trucks
antique fire trucks come in a range of sizes, colors and styles. most of the trucks listed on our site date to the 1950s, and some are even from the 1940s. most are in good condition, reflecting the previous owner's care. collectors may be interested in such vehicles, or a fire department could buy them to display and foster goodwill with local citizens who enjoy seeing the department's creativity.
along with antique vehicles, you can find vintage parts and create a historical exhibit in your fire department. with our offerings, you can design a collection of used parts for educational and decorative purposes. vintage parts and antiques are a great way to bond with former firefighters and other members of the community.
ladders
ladders are a critical part of any fire department's equipment, used for everything from accessing higher floors of burning buildings to assisting in other life-and-death situations. we sell used aerial ladder trucks as well as towers and aerial platforms, which are each useful in certain circumstances. our tower ladders provide a steady platform during rescues, while aerial ladder trucks can have tip loads up to half a ton.


mini pumpers
we sell used mini pumpers for those times when fire departments need a smaller vehicle to fight a fire. mini pumpers are easier to maneuver in small areas, so they can get the required supplies through small access points. this rescue pumper carries all of your rescue equipment in a compact package. a mini pumper can provide you with power and handling if you respond to areas with tight alleys or conjoined buildings.
fire chief vehicles
fire chief vehicles include command vehicles or units with markings to designate the driver's high position within the department. the vehicles usually have sirens and lightbars, and they are much smaller than an engine, allowing them to access places a fire truck can't fit. fire command vehicles are distinct from other types of emergency responder vehicles due to their appearance, and they can be modified to suit any fire department.
airport crash trucks arff
airport emergencies require immediate action. airports looking for used aircraft rescue and firefighting (arff) and airport crash apparatus want sturdy and reliable trucks in good condition that can get equipment and first responders to a scene quickly. many airports look for compact vehicles that can move around runways and navigate to the accident scene fast.
arff trucks are specifically designed for navigating through airports. arff and airport crash vehicles can quickly evacuate passengers and provide life-saving assistance with their speed and maneuverability.
rescue trucks
some emergencies require specialized gear. heavy rescue trucks have room to store the jaws of life, circular saws, cutting torches and other emergency equipment needed in a serious accident. relying on rescue trucks and squads can make a difference in life-and-death situations. finding the right vehicles gives fire departments the dependability they desire when entering uncertain situations.
used ambulances and transport units
first responders need to know they can trust the ambulances and transport units they use each day to carry people to hospitals and save lives. the used ambulances we sell cost less than new ones, while still providing the reliability first responders need. the electrical equipment in the back of the ambulance is often in good shape as well.
you can find a detailed description of every vehicle and photos with each listing. as a seller, you should provide detailed images and descriptions to showcase your truck's quality.

"fenton fire was great to work with! they were spot on with the prices they recommended assisted and recommended and changes for pictures and even predicted when this thing would sell. without them we would have gotten half of what we actually got and we would still be sitting on it waiting for it to sell."
