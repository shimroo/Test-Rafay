our history

						the fire fighters association of missouri (ffam) is an organization for all fire departments, firefighters and emergency responders throughout the state. the ffam was organized in the spring of 1954 through the efforts of waldo sherman, then chief of the herman fire department along with joe boeman of the missouri inspection bureau and joe fetters of the university of missouri adult education – firemanship training. during the first meeting of what was to become the fire fighters association of missouri, those participating decided to send a letter to all missouri fire departments to see who might have interest in joining a statewide organization for fire departments.

in response to the letter sent, representatives from over 100 fire departments throughout the state met in jefferson city on october 17, 1954 for the purpose of forming a state-wide firemen’s association. on november 14, 1954, the first ffam bylaws were approved and the first officers and directors of the ffam were chosen.

since organizing in 1954, the organization has grown from 600 members to more than 7,000 members.

stay on top of what’s happening with the ffam and unite with other emergency responders throughout missouri. join today!
