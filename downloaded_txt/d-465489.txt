psycho is a weblog template generator which is a single dynamic

viva psycho!

 



psycho is, in fact, an exclusive weblog template designer; because it helps you to

create your ever-wished template in less than 10 minutes!
walk on the edges of template design without any html knowledge!
have w3c valid xhtml template: higher ranking in search engines and more hits!
fix the browser's incompatibility: nobody will see garbages in your blog!
accelerate the loading time and style of your page: using div tags instead of tables helps your page to load the posts word-by-word, so the visitors won't nap while loading!
have css-based template: the page can never be lighter and cleaner than it!
always be capable to modify and share your template easily: save the psychodrama!

also, psycho is

an open-source project: you can read and even modify thousand lines
of its javascript codes under terms of gpl.
absolutely free of charge: you don't need to pay for anything!
based on a single dhtml page: no submission or lag it has!
working offline: just get the page and hang the connection up; it works yet!
supporting latest features of providers: keep your template always updated!
using particular help for options: you will never be trapped among choices!

note: as psycho's generated templates have absolutely no warranty and also
aideen is not responsible for them, 
it's strongly recommended to
get a backup of your current template before pasting new code and you won't lose anything! ;-)
