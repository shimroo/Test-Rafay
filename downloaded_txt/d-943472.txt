the cinema lounge

on monday, february 24, 2025 at 8:00pm please join the cinema lounge, the dc film society's monthly film discussion group.

topic: who will win the oscars?

in january we picked the nominees. now it's time to pick the winners for picture, director, the acting, and the screenplay categories. will demi moore cap her spectacular comeback with a best actress win for the substance? does timothée chalamet continue conquering the movie world with a best actor oscar for a complete unknown? can emilia pérez, a netflix musical about a transgender former drug lord, snag best picture or will it be the more traditional hollowood epic the brutalist? what will be the biggest surprise? who are we rooting for, and who should have been nominated instead?


please rsvp to atspector@hotmail.com and you'll get the zoom link 1-2 days before the discussion.
