hand-crafting fine furniture



since 1987














where traditional furnituremaking craftsmanship lives.



come visit our shop and showroom and experience it for yourself.















the beauty of natureour furniture is made to stand the test of time. we use the same native american woods that have given handmade new england furniture their lasting value and aesthetic character. tiger maple, cherry, white ash, black walnut, and pine are enhanced with dyes and glazes by our skilled finisher. we use a multi-layered, environmentally friendly finish process that creates a durable, water-resistant surface that is then given a soft low sheen glow by the application of a beeswax rub.















custom furniturewhile everything we make is built to order and we are well known for our beautiful windsor chairs, beds, tables, and our line of shaker furniture, we are equally proud of the furniture that we can custom design and build for you. we will make a scale drawing based on your ideas for a piece to fit your home. from desks, chests, bookcases, coffee tables, beds, or whatever you may have in mind, we will use our design and woodworking skills to make your wish come true.















guaranteed to last a lifetimewe believe in doing things right the first time. we make every effort to make you the best piece of furniture we can, and we stand behind our craft and the quality of the woods we use. should you have a problem with the construction of our furniture at any time during the lifetime of the original owner due to workmanship or failure of the wood, excluding normal wear and tear, we will fix it at no charge. you pay only the shipping to and from our shop.
