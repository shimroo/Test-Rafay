“i can rely on foreword to introduce me to new authors and publishers that aren’t generally featured in other review magazines. the design and production of each issue is beautiful as well!”

"we receive foreword as bookstore owners, and it’s very helpful to me when ordering, for sure.  i think the main value is it helps me sift through the indies and draws my attention to highlights. it's a crowded field and i can do my best with an eye for good cover design and familiarity with authors, but i rely on the reviews in foreword to give me more insight into titles i might otherwise miss.”
