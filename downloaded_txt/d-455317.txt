metal gear survive is an upcoming metal gear universe game, a sequel to metal gear solid 5. taking place in an alternate universe reached via a wormhole, survive pits teams of four cooperating players against strange crystal zombie-reminiscent foes, and apparently some form of metal gear. the game is refereed to “survival done the metal gear way.”

overcooked is a chaotic couch co-op cooking game for one to four players. working as a team, you and your fellow chefs must prepare, cook and serve up a variety of tasty orders before the baying customers storm out in a huff. sharpen your knives and dust off your chefâs whites, there isnât mushroom for error and the steaks are high in these crazy kitchens!
the onion kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! in overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.
play solo or engage in classic, chaotic couch co-op for up to four players in both co-operative and competitive challenge modes. youâll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team!
a culinary quest
the onion kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual kitchens for you to conquer. take part in an epic journey and tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens which will push your skills of co-operation and co-ordination to the very limits. each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it’s sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs.
simple controls/deep challenge
overcooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that’s when only a well-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!
different ways to play
whether indulging in deep fried local co-op or sautã©ed single player, as you play through the game you’ll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.
however you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!

line of sight is a next-gen online fps game that features many unique and innovative systems that we try to take them to the next level. line of sight takes place in a modern military setting in a twisted reality. to describe it in one sentence, “bioshock meets call of duty in a multi-player game.” sure, itâs an overstatement but we have no better (shorter) way to describe it. our unique psionics abilities will enable you to have a unique game experience. the first batch of these unique abilities are only the beginning and there are lots more to come in the near future.
and if you are a fan of pure military fps games and like to play competitively, no worries, you are covered too! line of sight provides “classic modes” where you can play the game just like traditional online fps games, often seen in e-sports scenery. you will appreciate the best-in-class rankings, clans, and league systems; we take e-sport very seriously as it is one of our highest priorities.
if you are a casual player, you will enjoy our unique contents, and stress-free match making system. you are free to play either casually or competitively, depending on your preferences.
we have got lots of more exciting features in the roadmap and we would like to bring them to you in the near future such as: innovative pve modes, a custom map editor, built-in professional tournament system, and myroom (custom hideout) to name a few.
