a democrat revolution via the courts:  railroading donald trump





donald trump was arraigned today on a third indictment by radical prosecutor jack smith.  the goal of the dems is this:1.  prosecute and convict trump of crimes so that he can be jailed and made ineligible to run for president;2.  drain his resources by making him pay high attorneys fees while defending himself, thus damaging his chances to be elected, in the event he is acquitted;3.  harm trump's reputation and sow doubt among voters, making them less likely to vote for him.4.  provide a counterweight to president biden's coming impeachment and divert public attention away from biden's massive corruption and incompetence.the charges against trump are very weak, according to some well-known legal experts like dershowitz, so it is obvious the dem strategy here is very corrupt and unjustified.  this is the stuff of banana republics and tin hat dictators, and could spell the end of our democratic republic.  it is hard not to become enraged and depressed over this injustice.

is san francisco becoming a ghost town?





what happens to a once vibrant city after it is captured by the far left?  in a nutshell, this:1. crime soars and goes unpunished as police services are curtailed and defunded2.  businesses close and move out due to massive shoplifting3.  homelessness and joblessness grow exponentially4.  streets become filled with camping tents, used drug needles, graffiti, rubbish, human excrement and the stench of urine5.  streets become dangerous for muggings, robbery and rape6.  drug dealing, drug use and prostitution become rampantthe following recent video shows the effects of progressive policies on the downtown business sector.progressivism is anti-human and anti-civilization.  it is more of a form of madness than a political philosophy.

my new dell solid state laptop





 this month i got a new dell laptop computer.  it is solid state, no hard drive, and boots up and operates very quickly, running windows 11.  i love it.  it is the best computer i have ever owned, and i have owned many.since there is no hard drive, files that are created are stored in the cloud, so if you are not connected to the web, you can't access them.  i work around this problem with an external hard drive, i.e., a 2 terabyte seagate portable hard drive (cost about $69).  i put all of my files on the portable hard drive, as well as in the cloud.  eventually i will delete the files in the cloud to make room for more.so i am back to writing in my blogs.

tales from the darkside





a couple of weeks ago i watched a vlog post on youtube by the grimmlife collective.  these vloggers specialize in spooky stuff and horror fiction, so they did an episode on a tv series from 1983 to 1985 called “tales from the darkside.”  i was intrigued and looked for somewhere online where i might stream the series.  alas, i couldn’t find one, so i ordered a pack of dvds containing all three seasons, and began watching them on my laptop.  frankly, i was disappointed.  most of the stories are pretty lame.  each episode is only 22 minutes long, not counting time for commercials, and it’s hard to generate much of a plot in so short a time.  most stories start off interesting but due to time constraints seem to slap on a weird or abrupt ending to finish it.  so in literary terms, there’s no denouement or epiphany.  the endings are usually less than satisfying.   “what?? that’s it??”.

fall weather in northern california





i’m sitting here in my backyard, just enjoying the fall weather.  i love this time of year.  the world always seems quieter in the fall.  big white clouds are drifting by on a blue sky.  very peaceful.  next month i turn 78 years of age.  my wife and i saw our doctor this past week, and were told we are both in disgustingly good health.  that’s good, i suppose, but i don’t fear death.  both my brothers are gone and i have a small amount of survivor guilt.  it’s hard to communicate with those on the other side.  i look up at the sky and wonder “where are you?  when you’re dead, do you know you’re dead?  do you remember life in this realm?” i suppose i’ll find the answers sooner or later.

suicide:  the selfish and cowardly way out (usually)





when i first heard about my niece’s suicide, my emotions were not of sorrow and sadness.  my major emotions were disgust and anger.shannon threw away 25 years of life that could have been spent watching her three children grow, marry and have children of their own.  she made herself into a pathetic, tragic figure, losing respect in the process.  in the minds of many family members and friends, she will be forever thought of as someone who had something terribly wrong with her.  that’s not a great way to be remembered.

my niece commits suicide





my niece shannon lies comatose in a hospital bed tonight.  today is her birthday, the last one of her life.  tomorrow they will cease life support and turn off the machines that keep her heart beating and her lungs respirating.  less than a week ago she went into the garage of her home in santa clara, california, stepped up on a sofa there, wrapped a curtain drawstring around her neck and stepped off.minutes later, her husband dan and eldest daughter found her hanging in the garage.  they quickly cut her down and applied cpr, as did the medical alert team that quickly arrived.  she was taken to the hospital where she was put on life support and tested for vital signs.  after two days the doctors could find no sign of brain activity; she was in a vegetative state.  shannon had been experiencing covid 19 symptoms for several weeks, which started after she was vaccinated against the disease.  she was told by her employers at san jose state that she could not resume her teaching position until she got the booster shot.  she got it and the symptoms worsened.  she was in constant pain and suffering from anxiety, but her doctors said she wasn’t dying and death was not expected.  what drove her to commit such a terrible act?  did the vaccine cause insanity?  i am no doctor and can only speculate.  she leaves behind a husband, a son and two daughters, the youngest of whom will graduate from high school on june 1.  shannon is 53 years old today, forever 53.update:  she passed away peacefully at 12:13 pacific time today, sunday, may 29, 2022.

reading charles bukowski





lately there has been a few youtube documentaries on the life and career of author charles bukowski.  i found him intriguing so ordered three books of his works.the first was “post office,” his first successful publication.  the common advice to young authors is “write what you know.”  bukowski worked for the post office as both a mailman delivering mail and later as a clerk sorting mail in the office.  his character chinowski reprises that role in this seemingly autobiographical novel.  the writing is entertaining but there is no plot per se, no denouement, no epiphany.  the same is somewhat true for his novel “pulp.”  however, the latter shows some interesting flights of fancy.  in “pulp" bukowski is a private detective (named nick) in los angeles.  one of his clients is a beautiful woman called “lady death.”  she is the feminine version of the grim reaper.  she wants nick to track down a man named celine, who in previous decades was a buddy of ernest hemingway and his literary entourage in paris. everyone of the members of the group have long since died except for celine, who has fled and hid and escaped death.   another client claims he is being harassed by an alien from outer space, and it turns out to be true.  my biggest gripe about “pulp” is its ending.  it appears to be a rushed and arbitrary ending just to finish the book and get on to other things.the third book i bought is a collection of bukowski’s short stories.  some are pretty good, like “the most beautiful woman in town.” others are crude and pointless, like “the gut-wringing machine.”if you like a gritty protagonist, a hard drinking, rough looking, cigar smoking and anti-social hero who gets into lots of fights but occasionally gets laid, you’ll like these figments of bukowski’s imagination.  i do so i’ll keep reading.charles bukowski1920 - 1994
