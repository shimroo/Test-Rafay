i walked into my head

thursday 5 - sunday 8 august
                      kilkenny arts festival - watergate theatre
book tickets
 karan's new stage show "i walked into my head" will be premiering at the kilkenny arts festival at the beginning of august.
                        "folk and traditional music legend karan casey is walking the corridors of her mind, looking for her voice in this brand-new showâ¯thatâs partâ¯song-poem, part music performance.â¯this adventurous piece demonstrates caseyâs brave spirit, constantly challenging herself to find answers to broader societal questions.
for the first time, karan breaks away from the songs we know to tell her own stories and sing her own songs, whether her voice likes it or not. from airports, van journeys and sessions to grief, motherhood and the unrealistic expectations of a female muse, i walked into my head is a moving, darkly humorous and sometimes joyful exploration of the trials and tribulations of life as a singer."

   after her march gigs were cancelled karan recorded some songs for npr's mountain stage
daughter dear 
siãºil a rãºin
