the statement of purpose

this site is dedicated to helping you with your application for admission to
a university. in particular, it will enable you to:
  understand what a statement of purpose (sop) is
  understand what universities expect when they ask for a
  statement of purpose
  use guidelines to write your own unique, winning
  statements of purpose and similar essays

on this site, we have tried to take the intimidation out of the essay-writing
process by providing step-by-step guidelines that we and our friends found
useful in our own application processes. while we concentrate on statements
of purpose for graduate schools, this site will also be of some use to
undergraduate applicants and to those writing essays as part of the application
process.
