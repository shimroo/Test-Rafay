for the love of clogging
clogging is a dance form that combined percussive footwork with appalachian figure dancing in the 1920s, and has evolved constantly ever since. we continue to celebrate our ‘hoedown’ roots, while also enjoying new ways for people to move with and without partners, and connect rhythms with music–from hip hop to country western and everything in between.
c.l.o.g. is a leadership organization that fosters education, networking, and a family-friendly environment for those who love to clog. we are proud to engage cloggers of all ages, levels and aspirations.
