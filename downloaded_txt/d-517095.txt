throughout the years joe's pizza in greenwich village has become just as popular with visitors and tourists as it is with native new yorkers who know where to come for an authentic new york street slice.
established in 1975 by joe pozzuoli, who is originally from naples, italy, the birthplace of pizza, joe's pizza is a "greenwich village institution" offering the classic new york slice for over 47 years.  first,  we served our customers from our corner location at bleecker and carmine street and now three doors down at 7 carmine street.  at 75 years of age, joe pozzuoli still owns and operates the restaurant.
