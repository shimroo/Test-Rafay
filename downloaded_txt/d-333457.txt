twin heart animal sanctuary

a small but vital farm animal sanctuary (situated in tappen, british columbia, canada) where our residents live in peace and love while helping the global community understand that they are no different than the animals in their homes-- dogs and cats. Â they too love life, their babies, and their human and non-human friends.it takes a global village to run an animal sanctuary.
