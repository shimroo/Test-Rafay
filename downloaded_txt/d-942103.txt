credit card acceptance policy





					we take visa/mastercard/discover/american express. due to the complexity of the systems now required to take credit cards directly on the orders, we've had to take a step back. those systems are geared toward much larger businesses, and fail to consider details that are particular to small businesses, such as strano performance parts.
					
the ordering process is still the same as it's always been on the website. the only difference is now you will not input credit card information. once the order is submitted, strano performance parts will call you to get your credit card information, and to give you any particular information regarding your order.
