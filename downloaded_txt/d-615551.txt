welcome to the webpages of the international shakuhachi society.

this site is an ever-expanding resource for people interested in the instruments used for traditional japanese music, particularly the end-blown bamboo flute called the shakuhachi.

we hope to reach across the barriers of nationality, culture, and tradition to encourage the sharing of information among players, teachers, composers, ethnomusicologists, and hobbyists. 

our focus:
the history and traditions of the shakuhachi, 
koto, 
shamisen (sangen), and other traditional japanese instruments.
the history of the music written for these instruments; 
“zen” pieces, 
classical ensemble pieces, 
modern innovations, etc.
information about shakuhachi masters, 
related musicians, 
and 
recordings.
the history, both objective and traditional, of 
the komusō monks.
