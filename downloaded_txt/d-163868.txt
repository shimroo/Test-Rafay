 william friedkin’s cruising (102 mins., 1980, r; arrow) was one of the most controversial films of its era – a thriller starring al pacino as an nyc cop who goes undercover, into the s&m clubs of the big apple, in order to find a serial killer preying on gay men. protests greeted the film, with homosexuals feeling as if the film painted themselves in a negative light, while the film’s sexual frankness turned off other viewers.

 in the wake of “jaws,” countless imitators sprang up from the depths, from joe dante’s “piranha” to aip’s “tentacles” and william girdler’s “nature run amok” outings “grizzly” and “day of the animals.” not one to be outdone, prolific mogul dino de laurentiis joined the fray with 1977’s orca, the killer whale (90 mins., pg; kino lorber), a laughably bad – if beautifully shot – cash-in that mixed “jaws” with a dash of “moby dick” and a particularly poor performance by richard harris.

 la-la land is releasing a remastered and expanded edition of the score that put hans zimmer on the map in hollywood, the 1988 drama rain man, which earned the composer his first oscar nomination. scoring driving miss daisy the following year made zimmer the first composer to score two consecutive best picture winners (and he has since scored two more, gladiator and 12 years a slave).


	mutant is releasing a two-cd set of mick giacchino's music for the penguin, the limited series spinoff of 2022's the batman. they will also be releasing the score on vinyl; other recently announced vinyl score releases from the label include companion, deadpool & wolverine, hit man, the imaginary and wolf man. (rule of thumb seems to be that mutant releases cds of warners/new line productions, such as dune: part two, furiosa, wonka, twisters, and the lord of the rings: the war of the rohirrim, though so far that's not been the case with companion.)


	this year's grammy winners in the film music-related categories are:

best score soundtrack for visual media (includes film and television)

	dune: part two - hans zimmer

	 

best score soundtrack for video games and other interactive media

	wizardry: proving grounds of the mad overlord - winifred phillips

	 

best song written for visual media

	"it never went away" from american symphony - jon batiste, dan wilson

	 

best compilation soundtrack for visual media

	maestro: music by leonard bernstein

 france's cesar award nominations have been announced, including their best original soundtrack category:

beating hearts (l'amour ouf) - jon brion
the count of monte-cristo (le comte de monte-cristo) - jerome rebotier
emilia perez - clement ducol, camille
holy cow (vingt dieux) - linda courvoisier, charlie courvoisier
the most precious of cargoes (la plus précieuse des marchandises) - alexandre desplat

	three of these scores have actually been commercially released on cd, and there is an awards promo set of emilia perez circulating. in comparison, only four of the 15 scores shortlisted for the oscar nomination have been commercially released on cd (challengers, gladiator ii, nosferatu, the room next door), though five others have received vinyl releases (alien: romulus, conclave, inside out ii, sing sing, the wild robot), and i would not be surprised if at least babygirl and especially the brutalist show up on vinyl.

 ocn distribution kicks off 2025 with one of the nuttiest films you’ll see this or any year: hundreds of beavers (108 mins., cartuna), a zany tale of an applejack salesman who loses it all and vows revenge against the horde of wild beavers who ruined his existence. silent comedy and slapstick humor abound, but mike cheslik’s indie film may have been better off as a half-hour highlight movie than a full feature, as its repetitive nature and lack of dramatic heft (that’s putting it mildly) make for a viewing experience that grows from intriguing to exhausting after just a few minutes.

 the latest release from intrada is a three-disc expanded version of john williams' oscar-nominated score for director roland emmerich's 2000 revolutionary war drama the patriot, starring mel gibson and heath ledger, featuring the full 107-minute score plus alternates, source music, and the 72-minute sequencing of the original soundtrack cd.


	the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has announced the nominations for the 97th oscars, including the music categories:

music (original score)

	 

	the brutalist - daniel blumberg

	conclave - volker bertelmann

	emilia pérez - clément ducol and camille

	wicked - john powell and stephen schwartz

	the wild robot - kris bowers
	 

music (original song)

	 

	el mal - from emilia pérez; music by clément ducol and camille; lyric by clément ducol, camille and jacques audiard

	the journey - from the six triple eight; music and lyric by diane warren

	like a bird - from sing sing; music and lyric by abraham alexander and adrian quesada

	mi camino - from emilia pérez; music and lyric by camille and clément ducol

	never too late - from elton john: never too late; music and lyric by elton john, brandi carlile, andrew watt and bernie taupin 

	daniel blumberg, clément ducol and camille are first-time nominees. volker bertelmann was previously nominated for lion (with dustin o'halloran) and won for all quiet on the western front. john powell's only previous nomination was for how to train your dragon, whlie kris bowers had been nominated twice before but not for music, only for documentary short, winning at the most recent ceremony for the last repair shop. this is the ninth nomination for stephen schwartz, already a three-time winner. diane warren has been nominated 15 times previously and has an honorary oscar. elton john has four previous nominations and two oscars, one of which he shared with bernie taupin.

	none of the nominated scores has received a commercial cd release. conclave and the wild robot are available on vinyl, and since a24 has its own vinyl label, i suspect they will release the brutalist at some point. a physical release of the powell/schwartz incidental music for wicked seems unlikely, but not impossible.

 despite having been released after a glut of serial killer thrillers – a genre that was exhausted in the ‘90s following the release of “silence of the lambs” – the cell (107/109 mins., 2000, r; arrow) ranks as a powerful viewing experience. despite its lurid and occasionally gratuitous elements, tarsem singh’s feature directorial debut ultimately rises above its material thanks to its visual extravagance, one that invites rediscovery on 4k uhd thanks to arrow’s new, definitive release that streets january 21st.

 predictions are in boldface, followed by those which i personally would nominate in italics. as with previous years' lists, for several categories i have not provided my own nominations, since frankly i know jack about costumes, sound and so forth, though more and more i try to pay attention to sound in particular. films that i have listed as my own personal nominations yet which will definitely not be nominated -- either because they are ultimately ineligible in those categories or simply not shortlisted -- are marked with an asterisk.

the actual nominations will be announced this thursday morning around 5:30 am (pacific time). i would have finished this list earlier, but things have been rather distracting in los angeles county for the last week or two. you may have seen some pictures in the news.
