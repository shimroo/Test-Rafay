great new interview with stephanie! writing to the beat of her own heart: stephanie tolan, an advocate for gifted kids, 
 weaves their tales into her fiction "the author, who has lived in charlotte since 1999, isn’t afraid to blow   off steam, especially on behalf of gifted children who haven’t been   encouraged to live up to their potentials..." 
  don't miss tolan's newest non-fiction, out of sync, essays in giftedness. stephanie's  powerful essays, collected for the first time. read her compelling metapor, "is it a cheetah?" and many other great essays on giftedness. as joy  tells us, "these are valuable gems in the canon of giftedness. treasure them."  – joy l. navan, ph.d.
 coming next fall (2017), applewhites coast to coast, tolan's finale to applewhites at wit's end, her excellent sequel to her award-winning surviving the applewhites leads us on more great adventures with jack semple and e.d. applewhite... don't miss it! 
learn more  from stephanie herself in this great youtube video applewhites at wit's end!  it makes you wonder... are the applewhites really based on the tolan family?
"it was a dark and stormy night..."

 surviving the applewhites 
      tolan's critically acclaimed novel, a 2003 newbery honor book, and now a 
		play.  don't 
		miss it!  read the first chapters on-line!
		in this laugh-out-loud novel, a young teen on the fast track to the 
      juvenile detention center suddenly finds himself living in rural north 
      carolina with the outrageously eccentric applewhite clan. jake semple, 13, 
      has been expelled from a long line of schools before coming to the 
      applewhites to be home-schooled. this extended family forms what a 
      visiting reporter christens an artistic dynasty, with various creative 
      endeavors absorbing the adults time and attention. jake is left largely 
      to his own devices, since the family doesnt believe in telling their 
      charges what or when to study. he develops a loyal following consisting of 
      an active four-year-old and an overweight basset hound, and his 
      transformation is complete once he becomes enmeshed in the familys 
      production of the sound of music. quirky characters, from the cub reporter 
      to the visiting guru, add to the offbeat humor. the applewhites 
      over-the-top personalities mark them as literary kin of helen cresswells 
      bagthorpes. running beneath the narrative that gently pokes fun at 
      everything from sculpture to tv documentaries, though, is also the story 
      of a boy allowing himself to belong and begin to discover his own 
      potential. this has terrific booktalk and read-aloud potential, and will 
      help fill the need for humorous contemporary fiction. -- starred review, 
      school library journal
