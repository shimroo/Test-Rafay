“if you like the way it looks, and it doesn’t fall apart, you are doing it right…”— elise
























located in scenic tarrytown
























 

here at flying fingers, we are a woman and family owned and operated yarn shop.we strive to offer the best and most interesting yarns the world has to offer, and primarily focus on natural fibers, including wool, cotton, silk, alpaca, cashmere, soy and bamboo.flying fingers grew out of elise's passion to knit, which started when she was taught fiber arts by her mother all the way back in 1963.  elise was always making knit items for her kids, and when they grew out of the cute sizes, she then began designing and hand knitting sweaters, hats, and accessories which she sold at craft fairs across nyc and the tristate area, and flying fingers was born.  it was a natural progression into a space where she could teach people her craft, the retail and classroom space opened in 2003. shortly thereafter, we opened our web shop, and invited people across the country and the globe to be a part of our knitting family.
