							hi cherry pickers,


							villa del sol is family owned.


							gary works the farm every  


							day to sell his cherries 


							once a
							year when they are 


							ripe
							for picking.


							despite the inflationary


							cost increases villa del sol


							has had to absorb these 


							last couple of years


							(much higher costs for 


							water, materials, equipment,


							fertilizer, etc.) gary and


							maxi have decided 
not


							to increase the price of


							our cherries this year.

 but 
							remember,


							we are in the business


							of 

							selling cherries.
							


							we have 
upick 
							only. 


							we do not sell 


							commercially at all. 
we 
							do not allow eating 
the
							

							cherries while

							picking in the orchard. 


							we also have a $10.00 


							per person minimum 


							purchase requirement. 


							whatever you pick 


							you purchase.


							 we sell our 


							cherries for only


							about month per year, 


							so

							pick, pay then eat!


							thank you for all of 


							your support. 
 


							gary and maxi
