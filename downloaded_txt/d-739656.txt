1srg saves lives in challenging and extreme
          conditions and aids others to do so as well. it is an international
            response search and rescue unit that delivers services
          and training which enable local resources to respond to
          incidents without external support. 1srg is the only
            non-governmental organization in the united states providing
            this service. the team is entirely composed of
          volunteer professionals and is available upon request to help
          anywhere in the world.
we
          provide humanitarian aid to other non-governmental
          organizations (ngos) and to governments that are interested in
          developing or improving indigenous search and rescue (sar)
          resources. we also work with rural medical clinics, sharing
          emergency wilderness medical techniques and medical supplies.
          we consult with governments and other ngos on sar and disaster
          response (dr) training and readiness.
we
          pride ourselves on our years of humanitarian service and our
          reputation for fast international and local deployment,
          diverse capabilities and safety. our track record of success
          is based on a cooperative approach of maximizing partnerships
          and sharing resources efficiently between the public and
          private sector in disaster, search and rescue, and emergency
          services.
we’re

          there to help. anytime, anywhere.





as of december 2012, 1srg is not
              operational.
