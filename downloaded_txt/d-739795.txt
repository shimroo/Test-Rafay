play / pause background











nsf ai institute for edge computing (athena)

led by duke university, the athena institute focuses on developing edge computing with groundbreaking ai functionality that leverages next-generation communications networks to provide previously impossible services at reasonable cost.

transformational impact















brain-inspired hardware


to save energy while improving performance, tomorrow’s ai hardware may mimic neural pathways. see how duke researchers have long laid the groundwork.











quantum fundamentals


one of the three leading quantum computing platforms was engineered by duke faculty and lives at the duke quantum center. discover the promise of trapped ions.











next-generation energy materials


energy harvesting and storing materials require atomic-level understanding. duke engineering is investing in powerful tools to transform portfolios in these fields. 







explore our programs


a duke engineering education leads to lives of purpose and integrity that are as rewarding as they are impactful. explore our supportive and inclusive community that defines excellence in engineering.








 



undergraduate


solve hard problems. have fun doing it.





 



master’s


master tomorrow’s challenges.





 



phd


prepare for a high-impact career.









training future leaders


duke engineering provides its students an extensive array of opportunities for hands-on experience with emerging technologies.













hacking ai


duke’s ai hackathon draws students from across the country to use the latest in ai tools to build working prototype solutions to real problems – in just two days. join in the excitement!











coding with ai


a duke-wide class explores how a chatgpt plugin removes entry barriers to the wolfram family of data analysis tools, allowing students to learn how to program without learning how to program.











low-key quantum


quantum computing sounds scary. at duke, students are providing other students a low-stakes opportunity to dip their toes into the emerging technology through a “house course.”
