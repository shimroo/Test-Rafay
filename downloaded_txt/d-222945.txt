rice university school mathematics project (rusmp) mission: to create a better understanding of the nature, beauty, and importance of mathematics by promoting effective teaching of mathematics and contributing significant research and evaluation on teaching and learning. our mission has expanded to include supporting science, technology, engineering, and the arts as they relate to mathematics. since its inception in 1987, rusmp has been providing a bridge between the rice university mathematics research community and the prek-12 stem teaching community across the state and beyond. rusmp is a center in the rice university wiess school of natural sciences.
rusmp's mission supports and promotes rice university's bold vision of contributing meaningful and impactful research and creative pursuits to the betterment of society. rusmp's mission also supports the latest position paper by the national council of teachers of mathematics and the national council of supervisors of mathematics that underscores the importance of mathematics for student success in stem.
