restaurant review: vanderlyle





there is a lot going on in the mill road area of cambridge right now. so much so that we were distracted by all the places to eat to notice we'd walked right past vanderlyle, where we were actually meant to be going. we quickly doubled back and hoped no one noticed we had walked by two minutes earlier.

i'll be upfront about this post: this isn't going to be a full review. there is so much information that i would have noted somewhere if i was going to write this up properly, which means i can't tell you which farm the vegetables came from or the variety of asparagus we ate, or the names of everyone we talked to last night (they were all very lovely, by the way.) what i wanted to do was write down everything that i thought made this place so incredibly special, and a tweet or an instagram post just wouldn't suffice.

i booked a table at the pass, which would be called the "chef's table" and cost a lot more at london restaurants (it didn't) and i thought might involve a tight squish next to two strangers and awkward small talk until the wine kicked in (it didn't.) what i hoped for was the chance to see how a kitchen runs during service, how food is prepared by people who really know and love what they're doing, and to ask all sorts of banal questions. i got this and so much more. i'm not exaggerating, we asked things like "where are your extractor fans?" this is the stuff i need to know. i also looked forward to catching up with alex rushmer, owner and one of our chefs for the evening. chefs are normally hidden away in a kitchen and my questions go unanswered or forgotten by the time someone comes back to the table. to be served by our chefs and to be able to talk about the food and many other things with them was, very simply put, a real treat.



alex rushmer plating up at the pass

it's a set menu that changes monthly, and if you're like me (i will eat anything, anywhere), this is perfect. it takes away the agony of deciding between ten things that look amazing on the menu, then watching ruefully as something that looks nicer passes by to another table. this is the second menu since vanderlyle opened last month and both times, the menu has been entirely vegetarian. this wasn't necessarily intentional, alex told me. it was down to wanting to use local, sustainable ingredients and both months, this happened to be vegetables. alex said that no one has complained about this or commented negatively about it. it made complete sense to me. how often do you get served a fantastic piece of meat, carefully prepared with a bit of veg thrown on the side as an afterthought? there is nowhere to hide when vegetables are the only ingredients. you can forgive a limp piece of broccoli if the steak is amazing. when it's the main focus of your dish, it has to be the best.







i had the alcoholic pairing (no surprise to anyone there) and paul/my driver had the non-alcoholic pairing.  the care that went into the non-alcoholic drinks was fantastic. all non-alcoholic drinks for the pairing are made in house, often using ingredients from dishes on the menu, such as the pea pods from the soup. really bloody clever and economical.



the first three dishes were slices of crunchy bread with a smoked butterbean puree, a warm cauliflower crumpet, and lettuce and pea soup that reminded me of the smell of standing in my veg patch when i'm thinning my tomato plants. there was also homemade rye sourdough bread with yeast butter that i got too excited about to photograph before inhaling.









then came the asparagus which i could eat again and again. it was sweet, not a trace of fibrous woodiness, and made me realise that i could never, ever eat supermarket asparagus again without feeling deeply sad.  it was cooked on a grill that reminded me of a teppanyaki. "you should do an onion volcano and juggle knives!" i helpfully suggested. the soft boiled egg was perfect (5 minutes, 20 seconds - 10 seconds longer than david chang's method, alex pointed out),  i grabbed bread from earlier to wipe up every last bit of the hay mayonnaise, and the polenta made with chickpea flour was crispy and light. 




i can never eat asparagus from tesco again and this is probably not a bad thing


the wild garlic and parsley risotto was rich and filling, thanks to the generous amount of butter and cheese i watched go into it. parmesan is added to the risotto and pecorino is grated on top at the pass. an intensely flavoured mushroom reduction is quinelled (did i just make up a verb?) and topped with raw radishes. the fresh, crunchy radishes had none of the harsh pepperiness that you normally find and it cut through the rich risotto. 







a steak-like slice of roasted aubergine was coated in miso and furikake, my go to seasoning for pretty much everything. (i get mine from ocado, but you can probably find it somewhere on mill road.) the most unexpectedly wonderful element of this dish was the roasted onion puree, which was slow roasted under parchment paper for several hours then pureed. how something this simple, albeit time intensive, could taste so complex is some sort of voodoo. the buttery new potatoes were so delicious, we genuinely contemplated drinking the butter out of the bowl when we finished the potatoes. but we are classy and totally didn't do that.







a strawberry and verbena semifreddo with beetroot that didn't taste of beetroot (a plus for us) was exactly what we needed after the risotto and buttery potatoes. the semifreddo was, and i hate to be repetitive, astoundingly simple and delicious. again, i would happily eat a very large bowl of the semifreddo alone.







but then came the cake. this gorgeously orange-filled cake. i watched as they came out of the oven and i could have eaten five more. 







finally, sadly, the meal came to an end with a glass of quady starboard that was like a tawny port and cookies fresh from the oven and chocolate truffles.









i haven't gone into all the alcoholic pairings because frankly, i know sod all about wine, beer, and fortified wine. i know what i like, and i can say that everything went beautifully with the food. i mentioned that i'm not a beer drinker and alex was happy to offer me wine instead, but the beer really did go so well with the risotto that it would have been a shame to replace it with something else. the non-alcoholic drinks were also so well done, thoughtfully put together, and not at all what i expected. most places would give you something sweet and overpowering (elderflower cordial, i'm looking at you), but these drinks were much more complex and interesting. i wish i could be more eloquent about it all, but all i know is that i loved it from start to finish.



also worth noting is how clean the kitchen was the entire service. i can't even do scrambled eggs without my kitchen looking like something out of "hoarders" by the end of it. clean, and quiet. no shouting, no "oui chef!" no "service!", just calm conversation and laughter.



from a business perspective, this restaurant is ingenious. or maybe it's more accurate to say that it's all about work/life balance. it's open tuesdays to saturdays, tables are prebooked and prepaid, evening service only. no possibility of no shows or a sudden influx of walk-ins, and sociable hours for staff. they know exactly how many covers are coming in, which dishes they're making, and as such, no food is wasted. this was a big problem in other restaurants, alex said. the amount of food wastage is horrendous. 



our reservation was for 6:15 and i told our babysitter that we'd probably be back by 8:00. we spent a very, very happy three hours watching the inner workings of a professional kitchen and having a brilliant chat with everyone. time flew, alex said we could stay as long as we liked, and i think had we both been on the alcoholic menu, we probably would have stayed longer just to watch the vanderlyle world go by and ask more questions. 



oh and to answer the question about the extractor fans, they're actually next to the induction hobs. they suck the steam down, and it's the cleverest thing i've ever seen. 


some practicalities:


the stools at the pass are incredibly comfortable, even for a shorty like me (i'm 5'4".) they are upholstered and slightly cushioned, and were absolutely fine for our three hour stay.
we parked at queen anne's terrace car park, which is about a five minute walk from vanderlyle. we got there at 6:00pm and left at 9:30pm, total cost was £4. affordable parking is like gold dust in cambridge. you can certainly take your chances with the side streets off mill road, but i can't handle that kind of uncertainty.
the restaurant will contact you in advance to ask if you have any food intolerances or allergies.
the lighting is not ideal for food photography, if that sort of thing matters to you. i had the advantage of sitting right next to the lights at the pass, so i stuck my plates underneath to take photos. but really, who cares? put your phone away and just enjoy it. 


do i need to put a disclaimer here? oh, what the hell. this is not a sponsored post, nobody paid me to write this, and we paid for our meal in full. although i've known alex for a few years and have enjoyed his food and conversation before, this is an unbiased review of our experience at vanderlyle.

for ian





"look! it's the boston ducks!" you said to me, as you excitedly pointed at a mug with ducks on it. "the...what?" i looked at my (then) boyfriend and his mum, both shrugging at me. "the ducks! you lived in boston, right? the boston ducks! the duck tour? the ducks from the book?" i had absolutely no idea what you were talking about, except that you knew i lived in boston for 6 months when i was a kid. even after we eventually got more of an explanation about the boston ducks, it never really mattered. this would always be our point of reference when we didn't know what you were talking about. we'd all look at each other and say "the boston ducks!" and you would smile too.

i feel like i need to replay these scenes in my head over and over, recall the sound of your voice, try to remember every single detail of the past 16 years with you as i try to figure out how to do this without you. as i go through each day, i realise that you are everywhere now.

you are your grandson who also has thick, spiky hedgehog hair. you are your granddaughter when she wrinkles her nose at pasta. you are your youngest granddaughter who would happily eat nothing but cookies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. you are your youngest son in a million "it's a durbin man thing" ways.

every day when i get my shoes out of the exceptionally clever cupboard you made just for me, you are there.

you are in mind when i look out the window and think about what i'm going to plant this year. i won't have my "toh-may-to" basket from you which, to be honest, was the only thing that ever really thrived in my garden. i will try my best to make something grow out of the advice you gave me. i wish i'd paid more attention.

when i get my morning cereal, i see your big box of weetabix in my cupboard. i think it's probably out of date now, if such a thing is possible with weetabix. but i'm not going to get rid of it just yet.

you will be with us in toronto where you went to summer camp and learned how to swim with a kid called bobby (or 'baaaah-bee' as you laughed), and you had your first taste of chocolate milk.

i sometimes roll my eyes at how we now only seem to see the world through the lens of a mobile phone, but it means that i don't have to look very hard to find you. you're dotted throughout my camera roll and the folders on my macbook. thanks to our online life, a lot of people you never met have been asking about you. i'm proud to introduce you to them.

for as long as these things are around and we remember, you will be here. we will talk about you and smile about you, then our kids will tell their kids, and you will still be here.

and we will always smile about the boston ducks, even though it still doesn't make any sense to anyone.

review: sticks n sushi cambridge





right at the start of meat street (depending on which direction you're coming from, obviously) is sticks n sushi, a danish chain with restaurants in london and now cambridge. yes, danish. why the hell not? i'm half japanese and half scottish; i'm all for fusion. it's a chain but it's not really a chain. a very short walk down the road leads to two other well known sushi chains, but i wouldn't consider them to be sticks n sushi's competitors. i see this as something higher end, a proper restaurant you'd go to for lovely drinks and pretty food.

sticks n sushi invited cambridge area bloggers and writers to come to "preview" lunches and dinners a few days before they officially open on may 7. i took my friend katie with me, who is my go-to person when i need an opinion on good restaurant food. i think she's eaten at every restaurant on my london wish list.

it was a gloriously sunny friday, i bypassed the office sausage and bacon rolls that morning in anticipation of a big lunch, and i was in a happy and very hungry mood. we were immediately greeted by several smiling faces and taken to our seats at the bar. our waiter told us that we would be served a set menu, but gave us the extensive "photo album" menu to look at for future reference. the menu is huge, with photos - 162 of them, to be precise - that helps people like me make food decisions. (i tend to skip over recipes that don't have photos. i'm kind of basic that way.) we started with drinks: a matcha tea for katie and a lemon and ginger fizz for me. i was pleasantly surprised that the fizz wasn't sweet, and on such a hot day (for england), it was incredibly refreshing.





"ebi bites" came out first, a sort of tempura prawn dish that was crispy and light. it's actually not at all tempura, i just used that word because it's on the menu. i'm not sure what the coating was, but it was almost like puffed rice. whatever it was, we ate it in about 15 seconds and it was good.





the sushi was the focus for me, and my expectations were high. cambridge needs decent sushi. we have japas sushi which is the best by far, but you go there to fill a sushi-shaped hole or get takeaway. you don't go there to linger over cocktails. otherwise, we have chains and one of them is good (fresh, nice variety, not too expensive, great for food on the go) and the other is yo sushi. all i will say on the topic is that i only go there when my children clamour for it, and they only go there because food goes by on a conveyor belt and you can push a button to get more food. so when rows and rows of beautiful sushi arrived on two long plates, we both let out a little "oooooh."





we had a combination of nigiri (fish on rice balls) and rolls. we were given a good variety to try, ranging from the more traditional (shake or salmon nigiri) to the more westernised versions of rolls (spicy tuna with avocado.) the fish and rice were beautifully fresh, and the rice was seasoned well. some varieties were more interesting than others, and you need to adjust your excitement levels accordingly. nothing involving salmon and cream cheese is ever going to be described as "an explosion of flavour" but we liked them anyway. we decided to be sensible (this is a rare thing for me) and take about 1/3 of the sushi home and save room for the sticks.

we had three stick varieties between the two of us, which was good because we were starting to enter man vs food territory with all of the sushi. we had black cod, asparagus in bacon, and as they must have got word about me and my love of bacon ahead of time, scallops in pancetta.  all cooked perfectly and hooray, double bacon!





i don't normally have dessert at asian restaurants (mostly because we don't tend to do desserts all that well and i've stuffed myself with dumplings and/or rice by that point) but we fit in two small dishes of yuzu sorbet and vanilla ice cream, which were very welcome on a warm day.





the waiter described the provenance of all of the fish on our plates and we had a chat with one of the managers about it after our meal. this is an important factor at this restaurant and it's reflected in the taste - and price. this is the cost of quality, fresh, sushi grade fish. the problem is, cambridge is used to supermarket and chain sushi that comes cheap. chewy unseasoned rice topped with a wodge of tasteless fish, but it's all some people know. even i find it difficult to fathom paying £13 for two pieces of sushi, despite knowing what i'm paying for. if it's a special occasion or we're in a large group (i love meals with lots of sharing dishes), i would be happy to come back here.

will the people of cambridge pay a premium for high end food or will this get dismissed as "london prices"? sticks n sushi is in an area right next to a large mall and across from a theatre, and many walk-ins will be looking for something quick and cheap. i think as long as you understand what you're in for, you're good to go. given the demographics of central cambridge (tourists, students, locals on a lunch break or looking to grab a bite before heading out for the evening), i would like to see some set menu deals, or prix fixe because it sounds a lot nicer in french. there are some nice looking sharing plates and set menus on there already, but the price still may deter some people.

disclaimer: look, i've been blogging since 1999 (on a tripod site that might still exist somewhere in cyberspace) and we never had to do this nonsense back then. you'd just go somewhere and if you liked it, you might write about it on your blog. these days, you've got to put a disclaimer at the end of anything resembling a review or nobody will simply trust that you went somewhere and had a good time. anyway, sticks n sushi picked up the bill and we didn't choose our own dishes. nobody said "write a good review or else we'll tell everyone that you're an asshole and make you pay for your meal." we genuinely liked it. okay? okay.

preview: cambridge gin laboratory





in addition to my husband, children, and a really good steak, there are two other ways into my heart: gin and labrador retrievers. you know those saint bernard dogs in cartoons that rescue people stranded in mountains with a small barrel of spirits attached to their collars? if someone could send me a labrador bearing a g&t, that would be awesome.

i was watching "great british menu" the other night and rich bainbridge (a norwich-based chef) wanted to make a victoria sponge cocktail to go with his dessert course. for this, he created a bespoke vanilla gin. the next thing we know, we're in will and lucy lowe's house in cambridge where they distill their own gin. (side note: when people ask about the benefits of working from home, this is the sort of thing i have in mind.) their cambridge distillery works with restaurants such as alimentum and morston hall, businesses, and (if you're very lucky) individuals to create tailored gins. on a busy week, will says, they can produce up to 60 bottles of gin. they are award-winning, world renowned distillers and i had no idea that this was happening a few miles from my house.

lucy and will are in the process of opening the cambridge gin laboratory in central cambridge, offering gin lovers a lesson in gin history, a behind the scenes look at how it is produced, and the opportunity to blend their own gin. there will be various experiences available, which you will be able to view and book on their site.


 



will is not only a master distiller, he is also studying to become a master of wine - a combination that is a rare breed. i asked him how wine tasting compares to gin tasting and he said that it all comes down to detecting flavours. "i even eat foods i don't like just to experience different flavours," he said. i learned more about gin in the few minutes i spoke to will than i have in the many years i've been drinking it.




one of the gins they produce is a seasonal gin that changes annually depending on what's been growing in their garden or available to forage that particular year. it is, without wanting to sound horribly cliche, cambridge in bottle. each vintage's report is a story about what was happening in cambridge that season. we had the pleasure of tasting three drinks yesterday evening at the gin lab: a cambridge dry gin and tonic, a japanese gin martini, and a summery basil smash. you're probably supposed delicately sip and savour it, but i took great mouthfuls and said things like "ohmygod this is so good."




how do labradors fit into all of this? i have an unapologetic, extremely biased love for labs and lucy and will have a very lovely one called darcy. she graces the labels and if you visit the distillery, you'll get to meet this gorgeous lady yourself. darcy is key to lucy and will's foraging, as they find botanicals to use in their gin during their walks. also, it's rather lovely to sip a remarkable gin and tonic while giving her ears a little scratch.

gin seems to have evolved from your grandmother's tipple to a spirit we are starting to care much more about. my heart sinks a little when i walk into a pub and all they have is gordon's and tonic out of a nozzle. it's not snobbery, it's the knowledge that there is something so much better out there. to know that there is exceptional gin being produced right here in cambridge is cause for celebration indeed.






the cambridge gin laboratory aims to open at the end of october. we were invited to visit before the opening, and other than the really amazing g&t, the only compensation i received for my visit was the extreme joy in having gin on a school night. this is not a sponsored post because i don't do that sort of nonsense.

penang soup





i have a cold, but just a little cold. not enough to knock me right out, but enough to be really annoying. i can't cough with much vigour because my abdominal muscles (who knew i even had any?) still hurt from my wednesday workout. i'm doing tiny little lady coughs that aren't actually accomplishing anything, and i sound like an idiot. it's a good thing that i'm working from home today.

my lovely friend georgia posted a recipe yesterday for a thai-inspired soup, and it sounded like the perfect remedy for a cold. one of the benefits of having a terrible short term memory is being pleasantly surprised by things i find in my cupboard that i forgot i bought - like a tub of penang curry paste. i'd just made some chicken stock to help knock out jack's cold, the weather turned cold and rainy today, so soup was the sensible lunchtime conclusion. i made this recipe up based on what i'd usually add to my standard thai curry, with a little nod to laksa.

i only needed to feed me today, so i made the full batch of soup but didn't add the noodles, prawns, or lime juice to the pot. i added these to my bowl and ladled the hot stock on top, and put the rest of the soup in the fridge for another day. the paste i used was pretty hot, so not only are my sinuses clearer, i can see through time. (thank you for that reference, lisa simpson.) if you've got leftover chicken or some other form of animal protein, by all means use that instead of prawns.

this isn't even remotely authentic. it's like a thinned out thai curry on rice noodles instead of rice. i'm not really selling this, am i? it's good. trust me.



where are the prawns?




oh look, there they are.








































thai penang curry soup

(serves 4)

50g/3 heaped tablespoons penang curry paste

1 tbsp oil

400 ml/1 tin coconut milk

1 litre/4 cups of chicken or fish stock (unsalted, because you're adding fish sauce for seasoning)

4 "nests" of rice vermicelli (i used the mama noodles brand at 45g for each portion)

2 tbsp fish sauce

2 tbsp palm sugar (you can also use dark brown sugar or raw cane sugar)

200g/about 20 king prawns

juice of 1 lime, or more to taste

garnishes: bean sprouts, coriander/cilantro, spring onions/green onions, or whatever else strikes your fancy.



fry the curry paste in the oil over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes. add the coconut milk and stock, and bring to a boil. turn the heat down and simmer for 15 minutes or so. 



while the soup is simmering, add boiling water to the vermicelli and let stand according to package instructions. mine only took three minutes, so you can do this near the end. drain and set aside.



add the fish sauce and palm sugar to the soup and stir until the sugar dissolves. add the prawns* and noodles, stir and heat the soup through for a minute or two. squeeze the lime juice on top.



ladle/pour/slop the soup into bowls and top with your garnishes. say goodbye to your cold.



*if you're using raw prawns, throw them in at the end for about two minutes, and cook until they're thoroughly pink.

sunday best at gog magog farm shop with guerilla kitchen: eat cambridge





i had neither the time nor calorie allowance to go to any of the eat cambridge events this year with one exception: sunday best at gog magog farm shop. i couldn't pass up the chance to have food cooked by one of my favourite chefs, and sunday roast is one of the best things i've discovered since moving to england. it's also one of the trickiest meals to do for mass catering. jay scrimshaw not only managed to feed us all with a couple of green eggs and his truck, he gave us one of the best sunday lunches i've ever had.

i first heard about jay in 2009 when he and his wife taffeta ran the pheasant in keyston, shortly before their appearance on gordon ramsay's "f word" where they came in second place overall. i went with a couple of friends to check it out before it got hugely popular from their tv appearance, and we loved it. the scrimshaws eventually moved on, focussing on pop-ups. i spoke to taffeta about it for an article and had the chance to enjoy jay's food again at two subsequent pop-ups. jay now brings his food (specifically, his incredible steamed buns) to cambridge via his food truck myrtle and did a special one-off roast dinner as part of the eat cambridge food festival.

there are so many things i love about a sunday roast: the gathering of family around the table after a week of speed eating and uncoordinated meal times, crispy roast potatoes, big hunks of meat, the excuse to have wine in the afternoon. although i do love making a weekly roast for our family, it's very, very nice when someone else does the job for me every now and then.




we sat in tables of six (or in our case, four adults, two children, and one 5-year-old diva who demanded a scotch egg) in "the shack", a covered outdoor area next to the cafe. we started with charred leeks with romesco sauce, a dish we devoured at one of jay's pop-ups a little while ago. there's no photo because we hoovered it all up in minutes. it came with a massive salad with apple, hazelnut, and blue cheese dressing.

the main course was pure heaven. meat. lots and lots and lots of meat. even better, meat with perfectly cooked side dishes: beetroot, apple, and fennel slaw (no filter needed), roast potato cooked in dripping, crispy asparagus, and yorkshire puddings.








but the meat. we need to talk about the meat. look at this mother lovin' meat.



lamb shoulder and pork belly that had a beautifully smoky taste that you can only get with charcoal cooking. i ate way too much meat. i had to go have a little walk outside for a few minutes before i could contemplate dessert.


the sun came out, the kids ran in the fields, and i finished my glass of sauvignon blanc listening to some chilled vintage (i.e. songs by people who were alive when i was a kid) tunes. the stress and chaos of a very hectic week melted away. if there weren't other people around who could see me, i probably would have had a little nap.


by the time the pavolva came out, i was actually ready and able to cram a bit more into my stomach. it was like a giant marshmallow slathered in whipped cream and fresh, flavoursome strawberries i've been waiting for since last summer. we all had a huge slice. then isla wanted more. and grandad wanted more. and jack wanted more. and isla started to have a hissy fit so grandad shared his piece with isla.





this was a wonderfully perfect sunday and as an added bonus, we came home with a bag full of leftovers*. thanks jay and the lovely people at gogs. i will happily let you take the sunday roast shift for our family again anytime.

full photo set here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lisadurbin/sets/72157653368766202

*(i may have stolen a bit of pork belly from the bag before putting it in the freezer, and i might be feeling a little bit like mr. creosote right now.)

banana muffins






i wish i had an interesting story about this recipe, but i don't. sorry about that. 



i had some very ripe bananas and jack asked me to make him some muffins to take in his lunchbox. he's not allowed to bring in anything with nuts and i wanted to have some as well, so i went with this nut-free and wheat-free recipe: http://wellnessmama.com/2637/grain-free-banana-bread-muffins/







i didn't add any milk as the batter was runny enough and i used butter instead of coconut oil. and they were really good. the end.

per muffin: 153 calories, 9g fat, 12g carbs, 6g protein.
