                    financial freedom
                








                        manifesto
                    


                            we've heard it saidthat 'a journeyof a thousand miles
                        

                            starts with a single step.'
                        

                            well, in our case it starts with a single question.
what's your idea of financial freedom?












                        think about it
                    

                        because when you shape your answer, you're starting to shape your life.
                    

                        think again
                    

                        chances are, your response won't be about riches. but about being enriched. and enriching those around you.
                    




                    financial freedom for you may be fulfilling a lifelong dream.
                

                     making your mark upon the here and now. or leaving a legacy for future generations.
                 






                        ...or just buying the most precious resource of all.
                    


                    time
                






                        choice
                    


                    and the greatest luxury of all.
                





                    our role is to ask the question.
                    and then to help you get there.
                


financial freedom










                                financial freedom
                            


                                    when i was young
                                    i thought that
                                    money was the most
                                    important thing in life;
                                

                                    now that i am old
                                    i know that it is.

                                financial freedom
                            


                                    so when i think about financial freedom, for me it’s clear: that means choice.

                                financial freedom
                            


                                    freedom means that you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose.

                                financial freedom
                            


                                    you only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
