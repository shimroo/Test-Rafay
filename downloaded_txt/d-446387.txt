this is just one of the cute pictures you can find over at my new blog:  momma muses.  my new blog is more about mommying than knitting, but i expect there to be a fair amount of knitting for baby content.  i hope to see you over there!for example:notice the cute (knit by me) wool longies that audrey is wearing!  i based these on the little turtle knits "the longies pattern," but made a lot of changes, like i knit it with 20 sts/inch instead of 18 sts/inch.  i also added cute stripes on the legs and a little bit more ribbing on the bottom cuff. yarn:  cascade 220 in dark green, light green, and hot pinkgauge:  20 sts/inchneedles:  us 7 and us 5 for ribbing

	 fo:  wool soaker!
	 
    


this past week i was working hard on making a wool soaker of my own design.  after two failed attempts i gave in and bought the pattern for one i had heard good things about.  specifically, i heard that it fits, which is very important when i am talking about something to keep my baby's bottom dry.pattern: little turtle knits "the original soaker pattern"i made the small for my 3 month ~12.5 lb baby with a 15" waist and 8" thighs.yarn:  cascade 220 from my stash.  the mc is a lovely peachy pink.  the cc is a vibrant raspberry.needles:  i used us 3 and us 5 16" circsfront view:back view:baby views:on a side note, fresh blueberries in oatmeal are yummy.

	 heartbreakingly cute baby kimono
	 
    


i finially got around to finishing the baby kimono from mason-dixon knitting.  i used sugar 'n spice from joann's and size 6 needles.  i cast on fewer stitches, i think 36 instead of 40 as my gauge was off, but i liked the fabric created with size 6 needles.  i chose to use a button instead of the ribbon.  here are some pictures.  i can't wait to see baby in it!

i am 29 weeks pregnant today.  here is the crib. (you can see dexter peeking out from underneath): i finished the bed skirt yesterday.  it was more difficult than i expected primarily due to three things.  1.  the kitties still like to eat patterns and dexter now fancies pins and steals them out of my seams.  2.  i am 7 months pregnant, so therefore, most positions are not very comfortable to me including the positions required to hunch over a sewing machine.  my back was killing me not to long into the project.  3.  the gathered seams.  i was supposed to gather the material at the top, but after much fuss and frustration and many snapped threads, i decided i like it without a gathered seam just fine, thank you very much.  here is the bed skirt up close. : and here is knitting!!! my (in progress) log cabin style baby blanket inspired by mason dixon knitting. it won't be getting much larger than this (~2 feet x ~2 feet) as i am running out of yarn.  i will have enough to do a narrow red border around the outside.  the blanket is made with dale of norway 100% superwash (and supersoft) wool, baby ull, 2 strands held together on size 6 needles: i hope the baby likes it as much as portia seems to:
