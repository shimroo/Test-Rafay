after the worst beatdown by a team in usc football history, the trojans should not be taken lightly. history favors the team beat down the previous year. a cursory examination of the schedule indicates they have not really been spectacular, but they have won the games they needed to. the winner of this game likely advances to the pac-12 championship game according to the new rules. this is also the bruins and trojans final meeting as pac-12 conference members, barring some political grandstanding by the state of california.

the ucla vs usc game at the coliseum will not mean much for the pac-12 south. but it will be notable in that there is no way the attendance could be below last year.

the ucla - usc game carries some weight in the pac-12 south, in that usc could emerge the winner following a decisive win over ucla, and a loss by utah in the next two weeks. usc has beaten the utes, and the utes just punished the bruins 49-3. it does not look good for the blue team in the matchup this year.

the group29 editor writes "this is the lucky 13th preview of the annual ucla - usc football game. it has not really every looked like a slam dunk for the bruins any of the reviews we have done in the past, and this year is no exception. (the bruins could not win with machetes is one of my all-time favorites from the past.) this game is always meaningful, but perhaps not on a national level.  usc already has earned their spot in the pac-12 championship game. ucla has very little to show for this season."

the ucla/usc game is never without worth. in this 2016 edition, there is still a chance that the trojans could win the pac-12 south. for ucla, they would be lucky to find themselves in the bowl season.

this game means something to the rest of the football world, in that the winner will advance to the pac-12 football championship. it amounts to a division championship, conference semi-final, and a path to the rose bowl. the football championship will likely elude the winner, even if they win out as the pac-12 champion. group29 has been doing this for a long time, covering the ucla-usc rivalry.

i think coach kill did get some credit. certainly, there
were lots of shots of him enjoying the moment. nice hug by jerry for brady hoke
at midfield, "i have been here man, i feel your pain." the gophers vs
wolverines was a little ralphie vs scut farkus in there, i am sure. heard some
rumors of some minnesota resident wolverine fans who have proudly flown their
big m flags for years now taking them down. minnesota has been the nail to
michigan's hammer for a long time. certainly the little brown jug trophy has
been held at schembechler hall for many years.

it was time again for our group to pick the 35 teams for the 2013 college football season bowl games. the rules are simple (until you get to the tiebreaker part...). simply pick the winners of more of this year's college football bowl games than any other contestant and walk away with a reward so priceless, you don't have to declare it on your income taxes!

ucla has missed the pac-12 championship game even after mounting a furious comeback against asu. it would have been their greatest of all time. usc is on a five game winning streak now that lane kiffin has been unceremoniously dumped at lax. ed orgeron is the coach to beat.
