              i discovered that if you click on joeuser...you get  joe user is currently experiencing technical difficulties. the blogs are currently offline while we correct the problem.  we apologize for the inconvience and hope to have joeuser back online as soon as possible.  renew that page....  you will get a link to jouuser home page...click on the link to forums there... and walla!!!! your in!
