early in 2020, a new organisation called the daphne du maurier society of north america was formed, with their base in dallas, texas.  they suggested that we forge links with them, and, with the blessing of the du maurier browning family, that is precisely what we did.  by joining together, we can promote their events and learn from any discoveries that come about through their meetings.  we can also share the knowledge and information that is continually growing on our website.  click here to find out more about them: https://daphnedumauriersociety.org
sir arthur quiller-couch, the great writer and important literary man of fowey, was often referred to as q.  some years ago, the daphne du maurier website was approached by the sir arthur quiller-couch memorial fund (the q fund) asking if we would consider giving him an internet presence.  because of the close links between daphne du maurier and q, we happily agreed to this.  so, it was with real pleasure that the du maurier browning family and the daphne du maurier website welcomed this section to the website dedicated to sir arthur quiller-couch.  just click here to find out more: https://www.dumaurier.org/sirarthurquillercouch.php
