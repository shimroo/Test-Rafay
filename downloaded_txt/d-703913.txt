about us
adams & westlake was founded in 1857 in chicago, illinois. in the beginning, our company manufactured and sold railroad supplies and hardware. with the opening of the american west and expansion of the railroads, the company prospered and diversified.  in our past we made just about everything, including lanterns, switch lamps, curtains, windows, beds, light fixtures, gates, sinks, and fixtures.  adlake became one of the largest suppliers of equipment to the transportation industry.  the company survived the great chicago fire of 1871 and some of our buildings still stand at ohio and orleans streets.
 
in 1927, adlake relocated to its present site in elkhart, indiana.  today adams & westlake is a privately held company and continues to work with the leaders in the transit industry relying on our rich history to create products seen on the latest locomotives, passenger cars, and light rail vehicles.  all sales, design, and production takes place at our elkhart headquarters.  this allows our entire team to focus on each project from beginning to end.  we work alongside our customers from the prototype phase to the full production phase to guarantee their needs are met.  we are proud to offer “100% made in the usa” products.
