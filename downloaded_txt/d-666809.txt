    about us


    offering fine creole cuisine since 1989.
















from the main dining room with our live pianist to private rooms which can be booked for business meetings and family events, to the bar area perfect for a quick bite and a cocktail before a show, mansurs on the boulevard offers high caliber food and service that keeps its customers coming back for more.
the dress code is "business casual" mostly aimed toward gentlemen.  we ask that all men please remove any and all ball caps upon entering, refrain from wearing any shorts, sleeveless shirts or sandals in the dining room.  special circumstances and game days we are more accomodating and susceptible to fewer restrictions. please call about dress code information or if you have any questions.

                    ok, finally found an authentic louisiana home for our taste buds! we tried the brunch on a saturday mid-morning and were treated like rock stars by the wait staff. along with exceptional service you will be totally satisfied with the choice of appetizers, entrées and desserts.

                    delicious food, great service. one of the best steaks i have had in a long time. the gumbo was also excellent. this place was enjoyed by everyone in our party and the food was delicious. would love to visit again.
