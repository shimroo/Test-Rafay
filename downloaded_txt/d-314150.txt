thank you!
when we think about cancer or heart disease, we don’t wait years to treat them. we begin with prevention. so why don’t we do the same for individuals dealing with mental health problems? it’s time to change the conversation.
the reinert cup classic 2022 was so much fun this year and we are grateful to all our sponsors, teams, donors, volunteers and of course - the reinert family!
