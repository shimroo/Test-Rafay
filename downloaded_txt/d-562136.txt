editors, international journal of cartographycategory: general news tag: international journal of cartography27 january 2025 manuela schmidtprofessor david rhind cbe (1943–2025): a visionary leader in cartography and geospatial sciencethe international cartographic association (ica) pays tribute to professor david rhind cbe, an extraordinary geographer, cartographic innovator, and global leader in geospatial science. david’s groundbreaking contributions to the field revolutionized the way the world understands, processes, and utilizes geographic information, establishing him as a central figure in the evolution of mapping technologies that underpin our information age.professor david rhind cbe (1943–2025)david’s influence on cartography began early in his career, particularly during his tenure as head of the geography department at birkbeck college, london university, in the 1980s. his pivotal role in the house of lords science and technology committee of enquiry into the handling of geographic data, chaired by lord chorley and published in 1987, set a new agenda for geospatial data management in the uk.as the first scientific director general of the ordnance survey of great britain, david transformed the institution from a traditional mapmaking agency into a global leader in geospatial data. his leadership was instrumental in the development of the fully digital national database, culminating in the creation of landline and its evolution into the internationally acclaimed mastermap. this transformation redefined the role of cartography in society and laid the groundwork for modern geographic information systems (gis).david served as a vice president of the ica from 1984 to 1991 and his exceptional contributions to cartography and geospatial science were recognized with the prestigious carl mannerfelt gold medal in 2005. his legacy within the ica community is one of innovation, vision, and dedication to advancing the role of mapping in solving complex global challenges.david’s influence extended far beyond cartography. his expertise in integrating geospatial data with statistical analysis led him to serve as chair of the uk statistics commission from 2003–2008, where he advised the uk government on the development and application of national statistics. his recognition as a fellow of the royal society in 2002—becoming the first geographer so honored in 50 years—underscored his success in bridging disciplines and demonstrating the transformative power of geospatial science across fields.among his many accolades, david received the royal geographical society’s patron’s medal in 1997 and a cbe in 2000 for services to geographical and social sciences. his remarkable career also included roles as vice-chancellor of city university, non-executive director of the bank of england, chair of the nuffield foundation trustees, governor of the national institute of economic and social research, and chair of the uk data forum.the international cartographic association extends its deepest sympathies to david’s family, friends, and colleagues. his vision and leadership have left a significant mark on the field of cartography and the global geospatial community.

editors, international journal of cartographycategory: general news tag: international journal of cartography2 january 2025 manuela schmidtpresident’s blog: year-end greetings from icadear ica colleagues,as we approach the close of 2024, i would like to extend my warmest greetings to all members, colleagues, and friends of the cartographic community. this year has been a remarkable journey filled with exciting achievements, collaborative efforts, and inspiring innovations in the world of maps and cartography. let’s take a moment to reflect on the highlights of the year and celebrate our shared accomplishments.a year of collaboration and growththe ica continued to foster international collaboration through various conferences, workshops, and activities. here are some of the key moments that defined 2024 from my perspective:
build on the momentum of former conferences highly successful regional cartographic conferences took place this year, including the eurocarto conference in vienna (austria), the asia carto conference in hongkong (china) and the cagis+ucgis conference in columbus (usa). they brought together professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts from around the globe. the conferences showcased cutting-edge research, innovative cartographic solutions, and inspiring presentations. from the dynamic discussions to hands-on workshops, the ica-led conferences proved to be a hub of knowledge and creativity. and it is worth to mention, that ica endorsed further successful cartographic conferences in latin america, africa and europe.
the record-number of ica commissions and working groups offer important focus points in a rapidly evolving field and deliver initiatives, publications and meetings, they remain really the power house for advancements in research, education and technologies. new proposals for working groups have been approved by the executive committee and joined the ica family. a warm welcome to the working groups on next generation cartographers (co-chairs katarzyna slomska-przech, chelsea nestel), cartographic body of knowledge (chair terje mitbo), inclusive cartography (co-chairs vincent an altena, jakub wabinski), standardisation in cartography (chair barend köbben) and participatory mapping (jiri panek).
celebrating the cartographic community: the heart of the ica is its vibrant community of cartographers, geographers, and mapping enthusiasts. this year, we were thrilled to welcome new members and strengthen ties with existing ones. the exchange of ideas, resources, and expertise has enriched our collective knowledge and deepened our commitment to advancing the art and science of cartography. the family of ica was (or is an ongoing process) joined by the following new national members: kyrgyzstan, cameroon and the following new affiliate members: national agency of public registry georgia, georgian cartographic association, arsc china, qingdao surveying and mapping institute china, asecna senegal.
a warm welcome to all our new members! and it seems, as if the eventual highest number of members ica ever hosted will likely increase further in 2025, demonstrating the relevance and contemporary nature of cartography and ica.
ica is taking a special focus on supporting our talents, young scholars and map enthusiasts. i am most pleased to announce another record, a total of 55 scholarship awards have been given 2024 for young scholars to attend an ica event (such as a regional cartographic conference or a commission meeting). given the fact, that the spirit, enthusiasm, contributions and motivation of those young awardees has enriched the ica events significantly already, we feel highly confirmed to continue with this endeavour.
ica is a non-governmental organisation run fully by volunteers. it is those commission chairs, working group chairs, executive committee members and persons which devote time, effort, energy for the sake of it, which makes ica such a unique organization which i am so proud of being privileged to be able to be a part of. the spirit is becoming specifically visible, when we have a chance to meet, like e.g at the ica retreat in vienna early 2024.the ica “people” in front of karlskirche during the ica retreat, vienna 2024looking ahead to 2025as we bid farewell to 2024, we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead. plans are already underway for new publications, including in the international journal of cartography, for initiatives to further support innovation in cartography, eventually by collaborating with strong partners such as the geo unions, the un, the isc and other organisations. we have plans for a further professionalisation of our organisation, as the role ica can play needs a stable fundament. we want to further build on strong fundaments of our discipline. and, the next icc, set to take place in vancouver in august 2025, promises to be another milestone event, and we can’t wait to see you there!wishing you joy and inspirationin this season of celebration and reflection, the ica extends its heartfelt thanks to each of you for your dedication, creativity, and passion. whether you’re designing maps, conducting research, or simply sharing your love for cartography, you are contributing to the main role maps play in our world. #mapsmatters #welovemaps.let me close in wishing all of you, that your end-of-year festivities be filled with joy, and may the new year bring inspiration and success to all your mapping endeavors.from all of us at the international cartographic association, happy holidays and best wishes for a prosperous 2025!– georg gartner
