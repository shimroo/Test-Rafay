treatmentslaser tattoo removallaser tattoo removal stands as an innovative solution for those seeking to erase or fade unwanted tattoos. this procedure involves the use of specialized lasers that target tattoo ink particles within the skin. by emitting precise wavelengths of light, the laser breaks down the pigment, allowing the body’s natural processes to gradually eliminate the tattoo over multiple sessions.patients may experience mild discomfort during treatment, often likened to the sensation of snapping rubber bands or mild stinging. the number of sessions required varies based on factors such as tattoo size, color, and individual skin characteristics. following each session, temporary side effects such as redness, swelling, or blistering may occur, typically resolving within a few days. adhering to post-treatment care instructions is crucial for ensuring optimal healing and results. laser tattoo removal offers a safe and effective way to remove unwanted tattoos, providing individuals with the opportunity for a fresh start.laser tattoo removal pricing: small tattoo removal £50 per session (up to 4cm2)medium tattoo removal £75 per session (up to 30cm2)large tattoo removal £100 per session (130scm -260cm2)the recommended number of sessions varies between 3 and 10.carbon skin rejuvenationlaser carbon skin rejuvenation is an advanced cosmetic procedure designed to revitalise and improve the appearance of the skin. during the treatment, a layer of medical-grade carbon lotion is applied to the skin, which penetrates deep into the pores. a specialised laser is then used to heat and gently exfoliate the carbon particles, effectively removing dead skin cells, excess oil, and impurities from the skin’s surface. this process stimulates collagen production, resulting in tighter, firmer skin, reduced pore size, and a more even skin tone. additionally, the heat generated by the laser targets and destroys acne-causing bacteria, making it an effective treatment for acne-prone skin.here are the benefits:even skin tone: the treatment helps to reduce the appearance of pigmentation, sun damage, and age spots, resulting in a more even complexion.tightened pores: by removing excess oil and debris from the pores, laser carbon skin rejuvenation can help to minimise pore size and improve skin clarity.reduced acne and breakouts: the heat from the laser kills acne-causing bacteria, making it an effective treatment for acne-prone skin and reducing the frequency and severity of breakouts.stimulated collagen production: the treatment stimulates collagen production, leading to firmer, more youthful-looking skin over time.overall, laser carbon skin rejuvenation offers a non-invasive and effective solution for achieving smoother, clearer, and more radiant skin.carbon skin rejuvenation pricingsingle treatment … £80pack of 3 treatments …£210booking section bellowpay £50 depositthe deposit is refundable if you cancel at least 48
