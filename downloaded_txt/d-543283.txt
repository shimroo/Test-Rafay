july 28-31, 2006 austin & cindy at jellystone cg

very nice cg – plenty of activities for the children.our site offered plenty of privacy. the cg is very nice and is very quiet it’s a short walk to store, pool and activities area.  clean & private comfort station just down the road. didn’t see any paddle boats or canoes. fish pond full of weeds did see some bait fish. however, no one was fishingcindy and austin joined us. austin learned how to ride his two wheeler without training wheels. actually took off on his first try.check out this link - http://photoshow.comcast.net/detectflash/ks7si4hawe got austin a mid sized yogi and cindy purchased a small yogi for jordan. a little girl they were going to the movies with on sunday afternoon.on sunday afternoon elaine & i drove south on 49 to find a farmers market. then we went north for snacks. there is a marlborough farmers market just north on 49 which is much better than the first one. went up to salem and found an iga.  also came across gas for 2.96 / gallon - and filled up the saturn.   we'll be heading home late this morning.labels: austin meets yogi bear

places we have been:

our policy for placing stickers on map: in our travel trailer days we had a large usa outline map attached to the back of the trailer. we established a rule that we had to sleep at least one night in a state in order to add a sticker for that state.so we decided to keep the same rules for our new toy.iler days we had a large usa outline map attached to the back of the trailer. we established a rule that we had to spend at least sleep one night in a state in order to e decided to keep the same rules for our new toy.

weekend in delaware

we stayed at the delaware seashore state parkrained all day saturday.sunday we took a walk alone the beach.  i tried throwing a bucktail for about 45 minutes. nothing happening.nice spot - right on the indian river inlet, walk to ocean beach, fish inlet or ocean, 3 way hookups, some tv reception, big play ground. no shade, sites are tight, and noisy during the week days due to bridge construction across indian river inlet.about 113 miles from home, easy drive and easy access to the park.added delaware sticker to our map.
