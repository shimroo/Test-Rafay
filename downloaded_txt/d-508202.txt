welcome!



the mission of the samaritan counseling center is to empower the whole person using a spiritually sensitive approach to counseling, consultation, and education.

we offer compassion and confidentiality, with each client and therapist working together to understand and resolve various issues.  the counseling team is specifically trained to respect the client’s spiritual and religious values and practices or their preference for a secular approach.
counseling is a healing and empowering process involving the whole person—body, mind, spirit and community.
