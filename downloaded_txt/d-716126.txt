what is a co-op? a food co-op is a grocery store owned by your neighbors (and by you, if you choose). ownership is an investment in a consumer-owned cooperative business that brings health to your local community. unlike corporate chains, the merc co+op is totally independent and owned by the community members who shop here. more than 9,600 of your friends and neighbors have chosen to invest in a local business that is guided by policies that prioritize the well-being of its customers and community. learn more about the benefits of ownership today!

valentine’s day is a great time to make these truffles to share with friends, your beloved or yourself. the simple mix of cream and dark chocolate makes a treat that melts in your mouth. 
posted @withregram • @coopgrocery
 

ingredients

8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped

1/2 cup heavy cream

1/4 cup strawberry jam

1/2 cup cocoa powder

preparation

finely chop the chocolate, either by hand or by pulsing in a food processor. reserve. line a sheet pan with parchment paper.

set up a double boiler and bring the water to a simmer. pour the cream into the bowl and set on top of the simmering water, then reduce the heat to low. add in the chocolate and stir constantly until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. remove from heat immediately. swirl the jam in 1 tablespoon at a time, leaving swirls of jam in the mixture. transfer to a storage tub and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.

use a small scoop or a tablespoon to portion the cold mixture and roll between your palms to shape into balls. place the cocoa in a medium bowl and roll each truffle in cocoa. place each in a storage container and refrigerate until serving

posted @withregram • @usd497 hillcrest elementary welcomed a variety of visitors from across the lawrence community for avid career day to share with students what it is they do for a living. the hawks spent the day with current industry professionals, who introduced them to a host of different occupations such as emts, veterinarians, pharmacists, event coordinators, fire fighters, graphic designers, forensic pathologists, police officers, architects, etc. presenters included some familiar faces and places like local muralist dave lowenstein, @lawrencehabitatforhumanity, lawrence-douglas county fire medical, officer bishop from @lawrenceks_pd, @themerccoop, and lawrence kansas parks and recreation, just to name a few.

as if career day wasn't enough to fill the itinerary, kindergartners were also busy feeling just a little older as they celebrated their 100th day of kindergarten. students made colorful paper crowns to commemorate the occasion. juliana hacker and two of her scholars put on the ritz and did their best 100-year-old impressions. looking like the cat's pajamas, hawks!
