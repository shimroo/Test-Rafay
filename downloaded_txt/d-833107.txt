pha events are more than just a chance to drive fast on twisty mountain roads.  we are also more than just a group of drivers to compare times against.  we are a group of friends always ready to welcome anyone interested in joining the sport, whether it be as a driver, worker or spectator.  we hope to see you at an event soon!
