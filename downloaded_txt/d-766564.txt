finding value in the line








the national football league from a handicapping perspective is not so much a battle between teams, but rather a contest versus the prevailing point spread. winning teams in the nfl also take home the wagering dollars 84% of the time, while 16% of the games in a typical season turn the straight-up loser into a point spread winner.the books offer not only the posted line, but the opportunity to purchase a half point for an additional 10% vig, more if the bettor is looking to move on or off a three-point line. most establishments allow players to purchase as many as three points.while it is immensely satisfying to save a wager that would have been lost had an extra half point or more not been purchased, buying points rarely improves a bottom line over the course of a season. it also carries the liability that some gamblers would make bets thinking that the extra half point or more will make all the difference in how strong their play on the game is. that can create bad bets that cost more when they lose.here is a hard and fast rule to best ensure long range profits: don’t buy points.that is not to say when a point spread is purchased and what the line is isn’t critical to maximizing profits. the ability to anticipate if a line is best bought now for a selection, or wait until closer to game time, is a valuable asset. nfl lines are not parimutuel, but rather locked in when the player places his bet.to assist players in taking advantage of the best line available, the qoxhi website shows opening, current and projected moves on each spread. if that graph shows that the kansas chiefs opened as an eight-point favorite over the houston texans in a divisional playoff game and the chart on the qoxhi site shows that we anticipate the line to move up to nine before kickoff, one can know that a wager on the chiefs is best done early, at the current line.in fact, this year the chiefs did open as an eight-point favorite and while we thought the line would climb to nine, in the final hour before kickoff the number actually moved to kansas city by 9½. when the chiefs took an intentional safety in the closing seconds of the game, they had their lead reduced from 11 to 9 with a final score of 23-14. those investors seizing the early line won, the bettors wagering late didn’t.in the 2024 season, more nfl lines came into play than in any of the 14 years we have been offering managed accounts that capitalized on advantageous early lines. in a typical season, three or four games are affected by early purchases versus the closing number; this season that number rose to nine.the first one, was only the second time in our history that a recommendation to purchase an early line actually turned what would have been a push into a loss. it happened in the second week of the 2024 season when our early call recommended a purchase of the houston texans giving 6½ points over the chicago bears. we anticipated the line would move up to seven points on game day. it didn’t, it moved down to six and the game landed on that number with houston winning the game 19-13.that game tuned out to have our early buy turn a push into a loss, but the other eight contests affected by the spread all showed better lines early than the closing numbers and resulted in three would-be losses ending with a push, four would-be pushes resulting in wins, and that one chiefs playoff game that turned a would-be loss into a winner.what does getting the better line mean to the bottom line?in a typical season it raises profits 12 to 16 percent … in 2024, the gain was 40%.having the right team is important, betting on them at the right time further shifts wagering on football from a gamble to an investment.

the basic strategy calls for the same amount of money to be wagered throughout the season in relation to the opening account balance and assigned money management number for each qoxhi selection. if the opening account balance was $10,000, an opening day wager on a five-rated top pick would be $550. on the final day of the regular season a 5-rated game would have a wager amount of $550 no matter what the current balance. this strategy is recommended for most first year clients for the ease of operation which minimizes the chance of wagering errors.

the aggressive method determines wager amounts in relationship to the current balance, backing rated selections with more money based on a higher account balance than opening amounts. this strategy takes advantage of a successful season while capitalizing on winnings within a framework that does not extend the risk versus return ratio.




huge returns in a season can be gained in campaigns when top picks hit at a higher than the expected 75% success rate while utilizing the top pick aggressive game plan. this strategy calls for using the percentage play accelerator and doubling wagers on top picks. the success of the top picks is paramount for a successful season. the high risk is almost always rewarded; only three times in 38 seasons did qoxhi top picks end with more losses than wins.




the top pick double method dictates wager amounts just as the basic strategy but double up on the identified best play of the week, the top pick.




banking all money risked on the identified top pick of the week is the perfect plan for the most discriminating point spread player. the top pick exclusive money management style wagers on the top pick just as the top pick double strategy, but also places a wager equal to 5% of the opening account balance on the moneyline. most qoxhi top picks are underdogs and therefore pay more than the 5% wagered on the moneyline, and when the top pick is a favorite the amount necessary to earn 5% of the opening account balance is leveraged.




the triple play method takes advantage of the motivational qualities of the qoxhi picks. most selections are underdogs and all own a determined motivational edge which is most often enough to get the qoxhi selections off to a good start, while sometimes a more talented opponent has the ability to come from behind and get a late win. the triple play strategy takes advantages of those quick starts with wagers on the first quarter and halftime scores. the plan calls for a 2% wager on the 1st quarter, 2% wager on the halftime score, and a 2% wager on the final score. wager amounts are based on a client's declared opening account balance and all selections are wagered equally regardless of their money management number.

nfl strategies

what and when
by dennis ranahan
unlike horse racing, where you make a wager and the payoff is determined by the final odds based on a parimutuel formula. in sports, when you make a point spread play you get the odds for the game that you bet when you made the wager. this means, it makes a difference not only who you wager on in a game, but when.in the national football league, 7% of the games are shifted on the point spread decision from the opening to closing number. turning a would-be loss into a winner or push has a huge effect on the bottom line. that is why our qoxhi site offers not only the opening, day-by-day and current point spreads, but also our anticipated direction of the line.

business for profits

the national football league has abandoned their hypocrisy on gambling. for years they claimed it as an evil while reaping huge rewards from the interest the point spreads added to their product. in recent years, they have embraced a full working partnership with a number of sports betting outlets including draftkings, caesars entertainment, fanduel and others.this is far cry from when i served as an employee in the league and was banned from gambling and frowned upon if i mentioned a point spread. as recently as three seasons ago, espn, fox, cbs and nbc were not allowed to offer a point spread on air within one hour of a day’s first kickoff.now, point spreads and money lines are flashed on the chyrons, that news ticker running across the bottom of an nfl telecast. on air personalities are giving their picks on the games with information that range from the game selections to over/unders and player stats.because of this participation in the gambling world, the nfl has put together a number of public service announcements meant to curb problem gambling. it is a little like a drug pusher handing out promotional materials for rehab clinics. in one ad, hall of fame quarterback kurt warner is warning gamblers to only bet what they can afford to lose.i have a different take on the situation. i suggest you only bet what you can afford to win. it is a more positive way to approach wagering and still provides the guardrails to avoid getting in over your head.how do you know what you can afford to win?

superstitions in the athletic world are as common as dry ice on an ice cream truck.while at alabama, quarterback joe namath had a pregame ritual of taping his cleats. in one college game, he didn’t, and he suffered a knee injury in that game. from that day on, including his pro career, namath never missed taping his shoes.in the national football league, where a dress code was strictly enforced and resulted in his white tape on black shoes prompting weekly fines, the jets found a way around the problem. to avoid weekly costs, the new york jets equipment manager had namath wear white shoes … he was the first pro football player to do so. namath figured initially the weekly fines were worth not taking a chance of not taping his shoes and suffering an injury because of it.irrational? sure, but superstitions are not supposed to be rational, they are designed to add a sense of doing whatever it takes to win for an athlete. bill parcells, one of the most successful coaches in nfl history, had a unique way of justifying superstitions. he said, “it is not so much that doing something makes a difference, but i have noticed if a player skips his superstitious behavior, he is likely overconfident and doesn’t perform as well.”fred biletnikoff, the oakland raiders dynamic wide receiver, had a ritual that required he put on his left shoe first. before a preseason game against the dallas cowboys in 1974, he was done getting dressed on the stool in front of his locker at the oakland coliseum and a couple of his close allies on the team punked him.“did you see that?” pete banaszak said to ken stabler while observing biletnikoff.

does this sound familiar to you?“i always lose my biggest bets.”for many people that is true, and there is a logical reason for this to be. the public gravitates to what looks like the surest things, that is favorites that appear to have the least resistance to picking up an easy win. it is on those favorites that the typical bettor is most comfortable risking the most money.why is this an inherent problem?because teams with the least to worry about are also the teams with the greatest potential to suffer a motivational dip in their performance. public perception is mirrored by the athletes involved in the game themselves. no matter how hard a coach will tell his team they have to be prepared to give their best against a seriously talent challenged opponent, he can’t inspire the greatest motivator of all … a fear of failure.this year, the baltimore ravens opened the season in kansas city and were within inches of deciding the game on a two-point conversion before the baltimore receiver was shown to be out-of-bounds at the back of the endzone instead of scoring the late td. the next week, the ravens were at home against a feeble las vegas raiders team that would go on to win only four games this season.

the first game played between the american football league and national football league wasn’t sold out. in 1967, everyone in los angeles covering or playing in the game was making their first appearance at the championship game between the two leagues which four years later would pick up the super bowl designation.in the second super bowl played, to complete the 1967 season, the green bay packers had returned and after beating the kansas city chiefs the prior year they downed the oakland raiders in super bowl ii. that game started a strong trend that a team with experience, that had participated in a prior super bowl, had an advantage over a team making their initial appearance in the roman numeral matchup.there had been four experienced teams that beat first timers before the pittsburgh steelers broke that trend in super bowl ix. terry bradshaw and company downed the minnesota vikings, 16-6, while making their first super bowl appearance and pinning the vikings with their third loss in the nfl’s biggest game.in all, 18 times the game has featured one team making their initial trip to the contest against an opponent who had super bowl experience. fourteen times the experienced team won, the only four exceptions were that win by pittsburgh to complete the 1974 season, a victory by the new york giants over the denver broncos in super bowl xxi, the first time participant tampa bay buccaneers downed the oakland raiders to complete the 2002 season and head coach sean payton had led the new orleans saints into their first super bowl when they beat the indianapolis colts to complete the 2009 season.experience over first-time participants by a 14 to 4 margin. for the record, in those same 18 games with an experience factor the team that had played in a prior super bowl was 12 and 6 against the point spread.this week, when the chiefs host the eagles, we have two experienced teams going at each other. the eagles are making their fifth super bowl appearance, the chiefs their sixth. both teams have had success in recent seasons and met in this game two years ago which resulted in a narrow chiefs win in super bowl lvii.
