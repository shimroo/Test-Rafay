perceptions of strength
* the following should be addressed in initial interview/discussion with clients, as well as students if you are a trainer.
as health professionals, it is important for us to note who or what image a client perceives as a figure of strength... a realistic one.  it could be a father who survived a war or trauma...and prevailed... not just a suit of armor...but a mental image of strength that doesn't have an external cover...people are vulnerable on the inside now...and external has nothing to do with it.  maybe an imaginary elixir...that you put all the necessary ingredients in.

strength
endurance
pride
tenaciousness
determination
realization that you are not alone in this.
sense of sharing - many are in this position - there is also strength in numbers and that can mean emotional/mental sharing...not necessarily "talking/sharing"...many people are not comfortable doing this...but instill a sense of "joint determination and resolution" of prevailing...not allowing it to "break you in the sense of your losing your strength and determination.
personal symbolism - (self-image, strength, fears, religious, political, family position, etc.)  one example is "superman".  many people may see this as an american symbol of strength but someone from another culture will not have the same view.  this would apply to various religious and political symbols of both people and objects of power. 

create an unshakeable belief that you will ride out the storm.  no matter how precarious a position feels...you will get through it.  it is similar to when someone  is caught in a rip current...sometimes you have to just let it take you along until you feel the current getting weaker further down the beach.  then you will be able to break free of it.  don't allow it to weaken you...just stay calm and go with the flow... you will find the opportunity to get out of it!
  
  ...and always remember, "sometimes the answer is not to take action at this time.  the timing is not right, and that is okay, too!"
