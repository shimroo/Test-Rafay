wooden
toys
and gifts from
upstate ny!
handcrafted toy trucks, trains and farm equipment. our wooden
toys make great gifts for people who love fine wood treasures. our
toy store sells rugged,
high quality pieces which are unfinished so they will show off the
natural beauty of wood! there are no toxic finishes on our toys what so
ever.
 we
craft each toy so it will remind you
of the real trucks and trains you see every day. feel free to browse
our online store full of uniquely handcrafted gifts! you can order all
our collectible wooden toys securely online.

by the way i am ken, the toy maker. i want you to feel comfortable
about purchasing our wooden toys online. 
our
goal is to build a toy with attention to proportion and
quality that will bring out the kid in everyone. many of our wooden
toys have been purchased as gifts for
people in the trucking industry. some pieces have been used as awards
and models. that shows how our attention to detail pays off.
i
believe that there are too
many brightly decorated "techno" toys flooding the market these days.
my goal is to return
toys back to their roots. that is why i strive for designs that are
simple,
natural and elegant.  you will not see a
cartoon face on any wood toys sold here! if you have
any questions,
please drop me an

 why
buy from
ken's wooden toys ? 


if
you are looking for a perfect gift that is one of a kind then look no
further:
the safety and durability of our
wooden toys is very important. all of our parts are hand assembled
using
all-weather wood glue (no nails!). all of our collectible toys
are smoothly sanded. no sharp edges or splinters to worry about! our
handcrafted creations are made primarily of spruce, pine and assorted
hardwoods.
we use a minimum of hardware in our pieces. we take great care in
handcrafting our wooden trucks and trains so they will have an
eye-appealing appearance that is unique. our wood toys make
wonderful gifts for people who love handcrafted transportation
vehicles. all pieces are
modeled after real vehicles and created with attention to proportion
and function to make them stimulating the imagination and a joy to
behold. we leave our wooden toys in their natural wood finish. your
model
will look like a work of art rather than another plastic truck from a
store shelf. our handcrafted wooden toys are built tough,
but like all wooden toys they are not indestructible.  due to the
fine
handcrafted detail and abundance of moving parts, we sell our wooden
toys as models for adults and older children. because each child is
unique in their development, parents must decide if our wooden toys are
appropriate for their children. the toys can be
easily cleaned with a cloth or scotch brite pads. see our toy cleaning
page for more information.

quick care tips for wooden toys
your
wood toys will last for many years if properly cared
for. it is always a good idea to keep your toy clean. a damp cloth can
be used
to wipe off light dirt from the surface. make sure the cloth is not
damp but
not wet.  for more in-depth cleaning
ideas, see our section on wooden toy care. wooden toys can turn a
darker shade
if left in the sun. this is a natural reaction of wood that is exposed
to the
suns rays. to prevent this, avoid leaving the toy in the sun for
extended periods.
some folks actually like the rich shade of aged wood. never expose your
wooden
toys to water. this can result in severe warping and raised grain in
the wood.









finishing wooden toys
we
sell our toys unfinished in order to show the natural
beauty of wood grain. if you prefer the look of a finished toy, here
are some finishes
people have used: (please note, we do not suggest or endorse using any
particular kind of
finish on wooden toys.)
non
toxic paints: water colors, acrylic paint, milk paint.
any water based paint has the tendency to swell wood and
raise the grain on wooden toys. this may result in a rough finish which
will
require a light sanding.  acrylic may be
the least likely to raise wood grain. 
stains:
if your piece is for display only in an adult
environment then you can choose from a variety of oil based stains.
always test
out the stain on a scrap piece of wood to get an idea of how it will
look. some
wooden toys look very nice with a light stain.
wax/varnishes:
the natural grain of wooden toys is what makes them look different from
their plastic
counterparts. the next best thing to natural finish is a clear coating
of
urethane or linseed oil. this should be done on adult only wooden toys.
