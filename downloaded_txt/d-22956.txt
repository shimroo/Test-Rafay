f.a.q







do you have a shuttle?
          we do not offer transportation but our guests often use uber or lyft ride sharing apps. taxi is available at the airport as well. 

how old do you have to be to check-in?
          you have to be at least 18 years old and have a valid major credit card for a $100 incidentals hold and a matching government-issued photo id to present upon arrival. 

what's your pet policy?
          we love pets, service dogs, and emotional support animals! we will require a $250 pet incidentals hold in addition to the standard $100 authorization which we place on the card upon check-in. the deposit will be released upon successful inspection of the room. animals must be leashed at all times. the weight limit is 40 lbs. service animals are exempt from pet deposits. guest must provide valid documentation at the time of check-in. dogs cannot be left unattended in the room. upon arrival, the guest will be required to sign a waiver legally obligating him or her to cover any damages to hotel property including damages to the room, bedding, furniture, etc. 

how much is the incidentals hold?
          in addition to the room rate, resort fee, and taxes, we place an incidental hold of $100 on your credit card at check-in. the hold is not a charge and is released upon a successful room inspection the day you check out. your bank will determine how soon the hold is removed from your pending transactions (typically 3-7 business days with credit cards and 2-4 weeks with debit cards). you will not see a refund, instead, the initial hold will stop showing. 

when will i see $100 back on my card?
          when guests check out, the courtesy hold is released upon successful room inspection. you will not see a refund. the authorization is simply a hold of funds, so instead, you will stop seeing the initial authorization. the hold will disappear from your statement once your bank processes the release. if you used a credit card, as we recommended, it should take 3-7 business days for your bank to show the release. if you used a debit card, or for international transactions, your banking institution may take up to 30 days. 

can i change my reservation?
          you can update your booking on our site if you made a reservation directly with us, over the phone, or on our website. simply click on the "book now" button and then scroll to the bottom of the page. in the footer, you will see the " modify/cancel reservation" link. if you booked on a mobile device, please update or cancel on a mobile as well.
          click and proceed. if you made your reservation via a third party, the hotel cannot help because we do not have access to modifying or canceling bookings made elsewhere. please contact the third party for any changes to your reservation. 

what's your cancellation policy?
          your cancellation policy is listed on the email confirmation you received. reservations made on our website or through our call center are subject to 72 hours cancellation policy. it's a penalty-free cancellation by 2 pm est 72 hours prior to arrival (unless you specifically booked a non-refundable rate). to cancel, please click on the "book now" button, then scroll to the bottom of the page. in the footer, you will see a link " modify/cancel reservation".
          reservations made on third-party websites are often non-refundable or restricted. the cancellation policy for third-party bookings should be listed on the email confirmation you received from them. we recommend contacting the site where the reservation was made to clarify the cancellation terms. the hotel cannot help with cancellations of bookings made elsewhere. 

do you have resort fees?
          resort fees are common in miami beach. our hotel charges a mandatory $30 plus tax nightly resort fee. it includes amenities such as free wifi, complimentary use of beach towels, use of the pool, free happy hour as listed on our site under the amenities section.  some third-party websites simply add resort fees in the fine print and guests end up paying "unexpected" fees at check-in time. 

do you offer late check-out?
          our check-out time is 11 am sharp. we sometimes have a later check-out available for $20 an hour after 11 am and until 3 pm. after 3 pm it will be a full night charge. however, this option may or may not be available. the only way to guarantee a later check-out is to book the accommodation for an extra night ahead of time. 

do you have smoking rooms?
          we are a 100% non-smoking property. the penalty for smoking on-site is $250 and will be charged to the card on file.
