in the glittering and ruthlessly competitive world of opera, maria callas is known simply as la divina: the divine one. with her glorious voice, instinctive flair for the dramatic and striking beauty, she’s the toast of the grandest opera houses in the world. yet her fame has been hard won: raised in nazi-occupied greece by a mother who mercilessly exploited her, maria learned early in life how to protect herself.when she meets the fabulously rich shipping magnate, aristotle onassis, her isolation melts away. for the first time in her life, she believes she’s found a man who sees the woman rather than the legendary soprano. desperately in love, onassis introduces her to a life of unbelievable luxury, mixing with celebrities like elizabeth taylor, richard burton and the duke and duchess of windsor.and then suddenly it’s over. the international press announce that onassis will marry the most famous woman in the world, former first lady, jacqueline kennedy, leaving maria to pick up the pieces.in this remarkable novel, daisy goodwin brings to life a woman whose extraordinary talent, unremitting drive and natural chic made her a legend. but it was only in confronting the heartbreak of losing the man she loved that maria callas found her true voice.“i gulped it down…the brilliantly persuasive portrayal of a woman negotiating the demands of her art with an intense emotional life is so compelling” - elizabeth buchanbuy ‘diva’ now
