i'm rob 
		allison, welcome to my nuggethunting.com 
		website.  this site will continue to grow in the future.  my 
		nugget, meteorite and gold prospecting experiences extend from northern 
		alaska, down to the lower southwestern deserts of nevada, california, 
		new mexico, arizona and ito mexico.  widespread amounts of placer, along 
		with lode gold have been found in these regions, which is part of the 
		western cordilleran.  i'm amazed at the amount of placer gold that 
		is still lying around in various states.  economic geologist 
		estimates that there are still thousands of ounces of placer gold 
		nuggets lying within metal detector range.  this range can vary 
		from a few inches, to several feet in depth.  many of the newer 
		technologies, such as pulse induction (mps, dvt & seta), 
can detect larger metallic objects at depths of 3-4 feet realistically. history 
states, large gold nuggets, over several hundred ounces, were once recovered in 
the early american gold rush days.  without a doubt, all of these large 
gold nuggets 
have not been uncovered.   with the use of a good metal detector, 
electronic prospectors not only add another tool to their arsenal, but also can 
cover much more ground, in return only adding to your chances of a good find!  
metal detectorist often find small alluvial and eluvial gold nuggets today.  
metal detecting has become quite the popular hobby within the last several 
years.

"what is 
nuggethunting?"   

     metal detecting for 
gold nuggets is also referred to as "nuggethunting" or "nuggetshooting." 
nuggethunting is a field of gold prospecting and mining, in which the hobbyist 
uses a metal detector to search for gold nuggets & deposits near the surface.  
since the recent technology advances in metal detectors and skyrocketing prices 
gold gold, electronic gold 
prospecting has become very popular within the last several years.  the metal 
detector is a tool that can now be used effectively to find shallow free-milling 
gold pockets and pay streaks within both dry placer and hardrock gold districts.  
remember, the old-timers couldn't see the gold, so they used methods such as dry 
washing and screening to speed up their recovery process in the arid desert 
regions of the southwest. unfortunately their recovery was low due to faulty 
equipment design and operational errors.  therefore, today many of these 
areas have been left high and dry and are prime targets for today's electronic 
gold prospectors.

"why a metal detector for gold?"

     for thousands of years mineralized quartz 
veins and exposed ore bodies have been shedding rich float before the old-timers 
ever discovered them.  due to vast amounts of weathering, many of these veins 
have now weathered out and formed hillside (eluvial) and stream (alluvial) 
deposits.  many of the hillsides around idle rich gold mines may be dotted with 
gold ore and nuggets.  today's detector technology, including the new pulse 
induction (pi) units can find pieces of gold down to the size of a match head.  
with the use of a quality metal detector, prospectors can now increase gold 
finds by covering more area in a shorter amount of time. 
    due to a high specific gravity 
of gold and millions of years of erosion and concentration, gold nuggets found 
the lowest possible place to rest.  most of the time, these areas were 
drainages, and the old-timers conducted most of their working within them.  they dug down and exposed the 
rich pay layers of gravel at or near bedrock.  in arid desert regions such 
as the southwest, drywashers were used the most.  the old-timers processed these rich pay streaks of gravel 
through crude drywashers.  due to inconsistent air flow, poor design and 
overloading resulted in poor recovery. some reports say the old-timers lost more 
than 50% of the values they processed.
  many of 
these drywasher tailing piles still contain sizable gold nuggets that can be 
recovered with modern day metal detectors. many of the drywashers used half-inch minus 
hopper screens, so anything larger was discarded and formed coarse tailing 
piles.  many of these drywasher spoil (tailing) piles are still waiting for 
a detectorist to find them!!   
as metal detector technology continues to strive, 
more and more gold will continue to be found.  many of the newer pulse 
induction (dvt) metal detectors, such as the latest minelab gpx 4800 & gpx 5000 open up old goldfields for 
new discoveries.

elusive 'retirement nugget' and everything in between, with the gpx 5000, you 
can find it. 

new improved electronics, new soil/timings and an amazing range of features 
combined with the legendary gpx ability to see through ground mineralization, 
gives you a significant depth advantage over other detectors. 
 using unique features, functions and industry leading patented technology ensure 
the gpx detectors run smooth and quiet in even the most severe ground

nuggets. serious detectorists know that gpx detectors find gold much deeper than 
any other detector, in all ground conditions. that's why we are confident to say 
we have the gpx depth advantage. 
 
with more timings than ever before, the 8 timings available on the gpx 5000 
change the digital switching and processing of the electronics in the detector. 
each timing has been designed for optimum performance under certain conditions, 
so it is like having a different detector each time you select a new timing.
