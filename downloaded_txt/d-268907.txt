13th - 28th february - cruise workshops on the spirit of adventure






peter has been invited to run painting workshops on the saga cruise ship âspirit of adventureâ, sailing from portsmouth on the 13th of february, on a 15-night voyage billed as casablanca and the canaries.

guests are invited to cruise to spain to visit ancient cã¡diz and on to the moroccan port of casablanca, where the seafront is dominated by the hassan ii mosque with its soaring minaret.

continue your all-inclusive cruise to the canaries in 2025 where you will firstly visit the island of gran canaria with its subtropical climate and coastline dotted with beaches and coves. next on your list of canary islands is lanzarote, where the capital of arrecife features a coastal lagoon surrounded by charming fishermenâs cottages. contrast the volcanic terrain of tenerife with the lush laurel forests of la palma before cruising to madeira..

watercolour on demand - vod relaunch














while dvd discs don't seem to be dying out completely any time soon, there has been a definite shift in viewing and purchasing patterns over the last year or so. this has prompted a relaunch of peters video on demand service, with two brand new titles, now exclusively available 'on demand'.

in langdale - pikes and tarns, he explores the fells above great langdale in the lake district, and challenges himself to hike to three high tarns (lingmoor tarn, stickle tarn and angle tarn) over three consecutive days. the result is a cinematic journey accompanied by five full watercolour demonstrations.

in two becks - malham and gordale, peter explores the area around malham, in the heart of the yorkshire dales, visiting the iconic malham cove, its impressive limestone pavement, and then on to the spectacular landscape of goredale and gordale scar. inspired by his visit he paints two watercolours; malham beck, with the dramatic backdrop of the cove lurking in the background and gordale beck - a close study of a small, but impressive, waterfall on the walk up to gordale scar.

all demonstrations are bursting with hints and tips to help watercolour artists of all abilities, from beginner upwards, improve their painting technique.


all titles are available to stream, download or rent (see individual video pages for full purchase details). more titles are expected to be added over the next few months, so watch this space!
