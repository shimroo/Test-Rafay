about us
sweet science nutrition is a wellness, nutrition and weight-loss center based in los angeles, california.

speak to a real expert about your unique challenges. weight-loss books can be helpful. we read most of them. the problem is, a working professional, a teenage girl and a golden-age retiree all have vastly different needs, and no matter how perceptive the bestselling authors are, they can never know you.

we get to know you.

in fact, as registered dietitians, we’re trained to understand your lifestyle before making any recommendations. learn correct principles…from credentialed experts. at sweet science nutrition, you’ll never have to listen to anyone less qualified than a registered dietitian – the very pros your doctor recommends. get inspired by a big-picture, expert perspective.
