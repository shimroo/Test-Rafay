"a virginia masterpiece by gary player"
located in leesburg, virginia, you will find raspberry falls golf & hunt club, a spectacular course with all the marks of what makes for an exceptional round of golf. as you encounter our rambling streams, bunkers, stone walls and spectacular rolling terrain, you're almost going to feel that you've traveled across the atlantic to play golf in the british isles. and yet you are in virginia's horse country, with vistas of the catoctin mountains in the background. the course was built in 1996, laid out by gary player design, opening that same year to quickly become one of the most popular daily-fee courses in the washington dc area.
