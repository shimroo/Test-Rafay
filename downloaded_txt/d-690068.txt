ordering
instructions:
october 
14, 2023 - regarding international orders:  mounting losses due to international 
packages apparently lost in foreign customs forces me to put into effect a new 
policy.   until further notice, i will not guarantee delivery on orders requesting 
shipment outside the united states.    if the shipment is held up by foreign customs,  it will 
be the responsibility of the purchaser to take the necessary steps to get 
delivery completed.   
ordering and payment
- all prices are quoted in us $.  minimum order $20 prior to shipping.  orders should be e-mailed to am@oldsundaycomics.com.  
please 
include a shipping address, or at least a zip code to determine shipping cost.  orders will be
confirmed via e-mail to sender.  order confirmation will hold items for 7 business
days on domestic orders, 10 business days on us-foreign orders.  only us$ money
orders or checks drafted on us banks, or paypal payments will be accepted.  cash
also accepted, however, i am not responsible for cash lost in the mail.  unconfirmed
orders may be partially or totally unfilled based on item availability, so please e-mail
first.   to avoid sleep disorders - no phone orders will be accepted.
shipping
- our shipping policy is: we don't make money on shipping, however we don't lose 
money either.  buyer is responsible for exact postage + a flat $1 for extra-large packaging if ordering
full-size pages.  i use us postal service.   domestic packages:  priority
mail (optional insurance available at cost).   foreign packages: small package or
parcel post.  shipping costs will be included in the order confirm, the buyer has the
option to withdraw the order based on shipping costs with e-mail rsvp (pretty
please?).  ups is not available.  
shipping
estimates(domestic usa):   sunday fulls  up to 8 - about
$10,  each additional 10 add $2 or $3 /  halfs or tabs:  up
to 10 - about $7 ,  each additional 20 add $2 or $3  / dailies:
6 or more sets - $5.00     
shipping
estimates(non usa):  1st-class(soft-fold fulls and 
smaller pages): $24-$36, priority(flat fulls) - $45-up
shipping
discount on orders over $100:  -$10-off shipping charge  for each
$100 of merchandise ordered  in any single order.   discount is applied
to the shipping only.  discount in excess of the actual shipping amount is not
applied to the prices of the ordered merchandise.  discount applies to a single order
and does not accrue on multiple orders.
money
back guarantee - if for any reason, you are not satisfied with any item,
simply return it for a full refund.  no partial return of lots sold as a single item
number (see my hokey numbering system) without prior ok from me.
mailing
flat vs. folded.  orders are mailed flat in reinforced packaging.
    i may be able to soft-fold fulls to save on shipping if
they are supple enough.  this is of special interest on us-foreign orders.  flat
full-size packages are considered large packages requiring priority shipping for foreign shipping which really
increases the shipping price.  unfortunately some fulls are just too delicate to
soft-fold.   now, if you ask, i can hard-fold fulls in half to save on shipping,
  but that essentially means damaging the pages.  in that case the money back
guarantee is voided on those items. 
sorry, i
do not offer free pics of the comics.
