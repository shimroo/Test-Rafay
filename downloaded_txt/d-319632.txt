eazamore than 400 zoos, aquariums and other organisations working together to make a difference for wildlife and our communities. scroll down to see how."progressive zoos and aquariums saving species together with you"what is eaza?founded in 1992, the european association of zoos and aquaria (eaza) is the world’s largest regional zoo and aquarium organisation, with more than 400 members in europe, western asia and beyond. they share a common philosophy: that zoos and aquariums can and should be important centres of animal species conservation, and that we can make the greatest possible contribution by working together as a network. in this network, we share knowledge and resources in field- and zoo-based conservation, and we help our members excel in animal welfare, animal population management, public engagement, education, and scientific research.   everyone has a part to play in the efforts to safeguard a future for the animals we coexist with. eaza aims to act as a gateway for citizens and their political representatives to understand and get involved in nature conservation. eaza and our members form partnerships with organisations, big and small, to help build support for effective environmental action. with more than 148 million visits to eaza zoos and aquariums annually, we know we can make a real difference. the skills, knowledge, commitment and passion of everyone working at eaza zoos and aquariums enable us to contribute on every level: from the human care of animals to the recovery and protection of species in the wild – all the while building alliances to ensure that our efforts contribute to the wider effort in a sustainable and lasting way. we invite you to learn more about our association, our members, and how we can all work together to provide a better future for animal species today and into the future. or, as we say in our vision statement: "progressive zoos and aquariums saving species together with you"for more information,

aquariums and other partners across europe, western asia and beyond. we strive continuously to define and demonstrate excellence in integrated species conservation through a transparent and collaborative approach to population management, wild animal care and welfare, representation with international organisations, conservation education, and scientific research.​our mission since 2021 a well-managed progressive zoo/aquarium is dedicated to safeguarding the future of the animals in its care by optimising the welfare of the individuals in healthy populations. eaza’s strict accreditation requirements ensure that our members are contributing to high-quality conservation, education and research, and constantly improve their practices, using the latest available knowledge. each eaza member has been accredited by eaza and agrees to a cyclical peer review of their institution. zoos and aquariums that need assistance to reach this level can join eaza's programme for candidates for membership and receive guidance from an experienced mentor.  by becoming an eaza member, a zoo or aquarium commits to participating in eaza ex situ programmes (eeps).eeps are a collaborative effort to manage healthy and genetically diverse animal populations, which involves exchanging animals, breeding, and many more activities supported by specialist knowledge. the roles of each eep are defined jointly by zoo experts and their partners from the field.   eaza members also commit to sharing knowledge about animals and their habitats, the issues that affect them and what we can all do to help solve them. we provide a high professional standard of education to our local communities; and we amplify their voices in policy discussions, advocating for animals and the environment locally, on the national and european levels, as well as worldwide. for more information on the various areas in which we make a difference, click on the images below.progressive zoo and
