welcome to 2023
            everyone!!!  i hope you had a good christmas and a fun new
            years eve.  i am just getting over a 2 week non-covid
            virus.  it certainly felt like covid and did include a nasty
            lung congestion, but my rapid covid test came back negative. 
            anyhow, out of caution i spent 5 days in bed 24/7 at the worst of it
            and i seem to be on the mend with my energy levels slowly returning.

          as tom does explain in his indian hunter article.

            finland independence day 







i
            am now working over 110 hours a week at 4 jobs to pay off some debts
            from job losses last year due to covid.  one main job that
            disappeared was as a cruise ship tour bus driver.  my time for
            arc is limited, but my passion for arc is still very strong. 
            sadly the advertising revenue from this website only covers server
            fees each month, so i really need to focus on earning money from
            real jobs for now.














rod bettencourt
            gets this update started with his big and beautifully finished
            1/32 revell/dragon bf-110c.  rod detailed the cockpit and
            other areas with aftermarket detail items and finished off hius
            stunning 110 with aftermarket decals.  this one is a
            beauty....enjoy the photos.
