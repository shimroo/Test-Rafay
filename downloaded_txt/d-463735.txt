good day people__________________________i have been recently booted off facebook for comments that where redeemed a security threat !!!the comments over the years i have  monitored for some time on several sites, however recently i had made comments on cancer and dr. burzynski which in history had mentioned about how matter and anti matter and the 5 states and change with temperature.i also mentioned the death of matain luther king, john f kennedy, marlyn monrowe, and boby kennedy and what may be a reason for why they may have stumled on to something whehter they knew it or not.their is no suprise to medical conditions in the kennedy family why they might seek for better medical treatment or like most beautyful models looking at the kinds of beauty make up, which require chemicals and the scientists in the chemistry field to that of the peopels person as martain luther king was.in the political areana from time to time a president may become privy to classified knowledge and how that be handled to the public.when it comes to broken arrows, the termenology of lost stolen or accidental mishaps of ships, planes or nuclear weapons.i had indicated about a american plane mishap that was indicated to happened over canadian soils in the 1950's about 300 miles north east of montreal and the bomb detination and the so claimed minimal damage, and how the area should be retested over again with improved technolofy on the micron and nano plane in the different color spectrums and to the visible and invisible spectrums as well using proton, neutron, electron, ion nano scopes to check on the mutated micro organisms, as may have effected the st. lawrence and other water bodies infecting farms and live stock to that by direct radiation or mutated bugs / insects. and maybe not so much so the tabbacco it's self but the bugs in tobbacco and other food productst that may cause several types of diseases, such as cancer and mad cow disease.ib the 1950's area 51 may have been used for science studies in testing parts that contain nuclear radiation that where in accidents as to not effect people from radiation.as the type damages on canadian soil from the bomb and how it would effect the people was not clear if matain luther king, john f kennedy, marlyn monrowe, and boby kennedy found out and went to the public during the wars or after the war would economically cripple america if they wouldn't play ball to keep secret and decided to go to the news papers and give info.to scare people or even get rid of them by using alien abduction if they enetered certain secuirty sones .            the position of face book and complaints to facebook and placement of international security that have no written and witnessed signatures of a contract or agreement that may be striving to control freedom of speach or written word on the basis of economic control, they did not create the sun, moon or planet, as to a higher power or that of the concepts of  god, jesus, allah or jehovah and by the indication of free will that had been granted as told onto many forums of religion world wide.a way of will is to share ideas without greed as not all follow the concepts of capitalism or can even afford in a capitalistic country to a pyramidic structure that only works for those at an apex position as many people find them selves in systems to better their lives and try move forward, where exploitaation occurs and people use this to dominate a power control on the basis of knowledge or physical strength an example - a person who approaches a group of high shool students that are unknowing of the persons university education and special trainings, the higher educated person with a hidden agenda for power control or economic control and not the value of equality balance  that propose ideas that many may work but use that to help the people create a system but at the same time to use it to higher their position in like a step pyramid to then act or control as if their god or something to power over with rules and regulations or manipulated laws.in canada it was stated that only an authoritarian power can give authoritarian power from a legal source. with time lines and other charts mentioned that studdies world wide began to prove manipualted step pyramids from early civilations of cannibals, butchers and slavests that could not read or write and even speek and that laws where only supression to control up rising against leaderships that had technically exploited their position from conquering powers of control known as abusive power regardless of their education levels over others and with the history of the discovery of lands called england to that to bring under one king that their those who did not partake for against and chose not a side what would be failure to support king of flesh  that is not god the king of kings that the king of flesh be that of treason or false icon that breach the 10 commandments and as for a kingdom,a political  queen is not first of a kingdom or a parliament but as positions that allow in forming and the change of laws for higher positions to escape punishment  that for any one else face death, torture and prison as of today ,an be the abuse of rights and pwer be the truth  .  i give this example:for people in all good intentions and joing groups to help in the improvement many found them selves in level structures that changed good ideas of equality to become a dominance control of decision making for political examples: of good intentions is the concept for child custody and the economic support be exploited as from universities and other organizations that in studdies that show the child in the middle  is exploited and the system is poorly managed.it is widely known that of mlaes and it is said for me to say that their are many dead beat fathers !!,but with changes in the history of society their are dead beat mothers as well,but as people are finding out that their are major problems of the child maintenance  enforcement system  when the system exploits females and male parents in ecconomic restraint as their are many cases of exploited positions comming to the surface that in working parrents and agreements and outrageuos amounts.in some cases :  the hiding behind the law but criminal law is not business law and over the years many judges had stated that custody court is not a criminal court.cases of lesbians and homosexual and of course hethersexual child custody cases or divorce problems, i had made suggestions of balance but as you know some are more about vengnece and revenge than equality of people, but i also indicated that in many cases of one judge is never a winner for their is always an upset party in the dicision making that i had indicated a pannel judgement and jury system and certain steps that may help as we know that x - party is a back stab system but if a person isa flight risk or violent party  to have video conference court session .      in any system it must be structures but for some people if not in a dominate control can not handle the decissions of any one else, in cases susch as this the ability to listen to the person to share an idea but with tem and their followers be understanding that an idea must be able to be flexable and work for many people and not just their own personal gains and that of of shared idea that people have right of choice and may not choose to follow as be a right of their own but that's why other things are done ( i not give here at this time as people copy write enfirngement ) . for leadership problems or issues.    the problem is a system that does not design balance in society, in truth we must be willing to accept that we must learn and rise to a position or that of a work level in which most all people can agree upon but the economic system of design dose not balance for the need of income to the gains needed for the types of education to rise from ones own pockets and the number of jobs that will allow that economic stability that creates the vicious circle of strike tax / strike tax / strike tax that creates only high inflation where no one can afford a decent education and work level of expectation falters growth.when a society of capatilism can not sustain good paying jobs for the poverty line and people need 2 or more jobs to pay the bills that this will create increased crime rate and more serious offenses as with exceeding loans or child support problems forces people to look at alternative meassures that ussully lead to illegal practices. - what this means that society by design creates criminals even if not the true intention. !!!       i also made comments on the positive direction of people and not violence when it comes to allah or god and ways to overcome the exceedingly growing violence around the world - it is not a right of control but a right to earn to sustain as no one owes anything unless agreed upon.  no doubt i am bad speller       more later.thank you.adam

new business

good day people--------------------------i have entered into a new business concept the sales of puppies, will be organizing all the papper work soon for my own first puppy.the puppy i have purchased is a french bulldog female and is 3 1/2 moths old she will come into her first heat in may to july but will skip her first breeding heat to allow her to mature, so if all goes well in 2016 will have lots of puppies for sell.this will open the door to buy land for a kennal breeding farm -   when the the kennal is established i will be organizing a private organiztion to be a member and part of land and space development team.i will post in the future, as a reminder in past i had mentioned about finding away for 14 - 15 projects this is only one i have come up with i have several others for the near future.in history i also mentioned sea walls around vancouver island - if you have watched that canadian news for british columbia ou wilol know that their is serious flooding - the type disaaters and other such problems will sermount in the future.the best advice i can give, even if you structure your own and you should but also if possible to help in other projects for space exploration - people are people and governments are no exception so learn and make and support to increase your chances or someone important to you.why others ? well when it comes to space and space travel technology can be a funny thing in the different environments of the universe, however you may find your self out of your own country at a location where you could be stuck. so different locations .    take care adam

top view -treatment facilitiesgood day people:over the years of survival, the damage and the struggles people face each day, and with the peoples culture and beliefs that clash from many ideals and concepts, the people in their struggles of life are faced with few choices from the desperation and the trauma that leads some people to break laws for food and shelter and to obtain money as to keep a live in third world conditioned countries in a capitalistic world.the problems of gorilla warfare and drug lords, many people have been captured and enslaved and for some brain washed over the centuries passing on the damage from one generation to the next, so what dose this have to with canada and the united states, you might be thinking, " simple," is that regardless of country is the problem drugs, gambling, and weapons abuse that feeds into teen violence and spousal abuse creating many other social problems.if crime was happening once a year or even once a month, but you and i both know that this is not going to happen anytime soon.this not from the lack of good people trying, however is a result carried over the years of misuse of trust as the things that people say or do in social under current grouping.the problems in canada and the united states are faced with many problems that effect the planets environment and economic system as inflation is an inevitable situation making it harder each year for hard working people, so it stands to reason those of lessor income will be greater risk to make wrong choices, with failing education programs and medical systems and not from the lack of people to work but economic cutbacks effecting the people.as with some people working 2 jobs now needing three jobs to keep the flow income, as with some people thinking of family not thinking of the consequences listening to wrong people getting into criminal activities, while others turn to alcohol or illegal drugs that find them selves with criminal records and probation or simply off to prison.the prisons of today have come along way from the mid-evil age dungeons and torture chambers but in some places of the world torture still exists, the problem still exists is the over crowding and the expenditures that cause the taxpayers.the prisons of history where designed to hold and not to heal or benefit the prisoner but a retribution payback of vengeance and revenge, some may say good they deserve and maybe that's true, but the problem sill exists with out the right design the cost expenditures, overcrowding and the violence that turns people hard and for others new or improved ways to break less on release,.   most people could do without but when it comes to their children or loving partner to be without a good job or money to pay the bills, i am sure by now that 90 - 99.9% know the right from wrong but still many will choose to undercur and for others will struggle.their is a need to make the right treatment facilities and prison systems that can actually make money.how ?

human communications and computer communication interactions 1

human language code communications andcomputer language code communication interactions*********************************************************************************************in the concepts of human communications between people the clarity of the known language that is used for example by two people is basically understood, however when it comes to people to the computer, the computer is a basic input / output storage device and dose not reason logic or emotions by instinct as people do and that is because of the design purpose and programing function.basic public user systems are not designed like an android or sustain software to sustain a conscience or sub-conscience.if a computer was designed to have conscience and sub-conscience it would still have to be trained like a voice to text program and trained like 8 moth child, a human child or an adult sustain nociceptors,  which are cells that feel pain, a laptop dose not feel pain or see or hear for that matter  because it lacks the right sensor design and programing structure to allow comprehension and interpretation to response.         computers have only a basic communication interaction and even if the software was improved the processor and chip sets are limited and with the concepts of hearing and sight web cams and microphones are limited by the types of sensors.the software needed to be created is like interacting with sybille ( multiple personalities ) as the question or entry input to learning, then understanding then the knowing to conclude the question part of steps / then the purpose, function and procedures to sustain the answer but knowing the answer is only still part,  as now the choices of the type of interactions to the types of response to be given, whether the answer be displayed response or verbal response or by interaction of printed or typed word to screen or printer.laptop or pc's are not androids but dealing with robotics to sustain a conscience and sub-conscience the ability to make rational thought and decisions to use a hand with a pencil to place answer to paper as the step procedures of interactions of probability of choice  to lead to rational and logical conclusions of steps made from the multiple questions and answers to input and output procedures interaction, so the data from sensors that will allow cause effect and effect cause to follow through the responses , however the the probabilities with hand and eye coordination from self thought and and choice interactions are not the same if android leads to human interaction than that of human first initiating conversation or physical response.play write scripting and programing - sybille ( multiple personalities ) not really .in a script for a play, it gives a listing of the characters and the dialog that they will speak and the the order in which they will communicate.in the play dialog it is not only thing characters do, as their will be interactions and emotions to respond on cue, if all cues and dialog are preformed in order of fluid motion the the play is a success, this like the computer or android to hardware functions and software functions and how they will interact.in self communications play write scripting using a dialog character for each peace, part or component, however most boards do not contain sensors for every nut bolt screw and washer like the human body but the human body is aware of all cells that lives and dies, so the design of the software must made to be aware. for example  piece to piece communications / part to part communications and component to component communications for the piece to the part or part to the piece / piece or part to component and the component to piece or part, as you see the possible communication structures as casual, peer to peer or hierarchy command of data communications of exchange in upward downward and lateral flow  computer communications is like making a play script and map, the importance of the behavior of the pieces to the parts and the parts to components to turn on and off or open and close to the right sequences that will create the right mechanical behavior. background operations of the computer is like the prop master - ( chips ),  special effects - ( sensors ),  and stage coordinator - ( processor )  that allows the system to run other needed functions.the problem is the processor and the software as the processor is not a brain and the software is not sustaining all the script, even if the script was improved the motherboard dose not sustain all the key chips or that of the processor capable to process all functions on basic public pc for self thought creativity or dreaming. however improvements can be made.       hierarchies plural and  singular hierarchy to the past tense, present tense, and future tense to the source 0f signal(s) primary, secondary and both to transmissions, transmissions - receptions and the receptions, receptions - transmissions, or both and combinations  can be done in several ways when it comes to hardware and software for examples:hardware hierarchies -mainframe control over server and server over pc as downward chain of command or shared level of command regardless of the size or type computer system.the source signal and the response signal as a direct path compared to indirect path alternatives, also from source signal to more than one location direct or indirect for return or carried to other location.more than one source to from the same location or different source locations to one or more response locations of direct or indirect path.the signals of the sound signal(s) or light signal(s) can be the same or different of the code and carry more than one function or purpose however this is more of data transference of exchange to shared functions and duties of instruction process  is not verbal communications from the type of processes like a human mind but the purpose of thought, thinking, and knowing .tandem and random sequences of comparison of a computer must be taught to choice thinking like a child for correct responses to the conditions of the time and event or it just data possibilities probabilities.the controllers of the 6 senses to the program must correlate ( communicate ) by design interaction.to create more human  like communications the mainframe, server, pc or laptop would have to be created like an android mind.the easiest way to do this is to look at medical books of the human brain and the spinal cord an nervous system, as you will see how signals are sent to to and from the brain and from the parts of the brain, also how the senses interact with communications of the brain.the logical construct to a board is contain the areas of the brain and the placements for the six senses  creating steady stream of info data input and output for the background and foreground  operations and functions of self awareness  in the forms of communications. computers visual sight  - for the mother board circuitkeep in mind this not the display sight or display and not part of security cameras, which be different than webcam functions. human sight has 2 eyes but is limited, when it comes to the visual perception of the computer for self sightso to improve the sight one should research the many species of life and take the best of all into consideration and on conclusion create the design but also keep in mind the brain functions in procession visual information's computer taste - external device sensor computer smell - external devices - smoke alarm computer touch - external device - hands and feet computer feelings - internal and external sensors that react by cause effect and programed emotion to response action.computer hearing - common hearing, advanced hearing, multiple functions   along the journey to give information on computers and create a system that would be easy to use and operate the realization  and the understanding of the long history of mankind to the claimed loyalties many have faltered for greed and power since the snake in the garden of the soul called story of human rights and the equality of man over the last 5 years the opportunity was given to help with in a ideasome of the information's that have been shown was only a reflection of already known knowledge as to give an understanding, however the systems and ideas where for the chances for the population structures of countries after 2 years of the 5 year period i began to look for an alternative structure never mentioned for a select few and their is where i will be spending my efforts.i have given the opportunity for those dedicated to rise over the 17% - 38% chance of survival but will be lie russian roulette  and the greater chance of survival possibility will most likely the criminal underworldin 2017 to 2019, hopefully i will be wrong but is most likely one of the first signs of civil unrest that will lead to significant changes and will rift the society as one of the many under currents of time comes to light of great civil riot in the united states caused by the increased inflation and taxes do heavy costs and the level of dispare in the civil population between those of non criminal and criminal records and the control of the streetsif this concurs you know i will have failed and eventually over the millennium the species of man will become to be extinct through out the universe.in the future when the understanding of time becomes more apparent to reality, remember mankind was not first and not all are allies even amongst friends and allies, remember that of early man would not know the difference between god, lucifer, and the serpent but man was know innocent  .  adam -

human communications and computer communication interactions

human language code communications andcomputer language code communication interactions*********************************************************************************************note :knowledge is the learning, however the type of learning may not be right for you or the time period of your life do to circumstances.the important thing is learning to understand and understand what is learned and the importance to whom is to learn as not all people consider the importance of others in equality.the hierarchy of communications is one of the most important concepts in social order and computers, i have spent some time reflecting on this concept and i have come to realize that like my self and so many others we have never been taught in elementary, high school or even post secondary, sure you know theirs a teacher or principal or a queen but the real structure behind the system concept, it seems that public schools do not cover the subject lesson.without knowing the hierarchy ?you may find your self or children cheated of the right education  and be at the bottom of the social ladder and with financial despairthis why it is good thing to learn the different social hierarchy's and how to create your own legal hierarchy. ------------------------------------------------     types of hierarchies primary hierarchiesmain hierarchiesbackup hierarchiesextra hierarchiesemergencies hierarchiespriority hierarchieslogical hierarchiesnonexistence hierarchiesending hierarchydeath hierarchyunknown hierarchysubconscious hierarchythoughts hierarchyidea hierarchyactions hierarchyfeelings hierarchyexistence hierarchiesbeginning hierarchyknown hierarchyconscious hierarchy thought hierarchyidea hierarchyliving hierarchyactions hierarchyfeelings hierarchyanimate hierarchies human hierarchyanimal hierarchy inanimate hierarchiescomputer hierarchyclass hierarchydeclaration hierarchy instruction hierarchy library hierarchy storage hierarchyinventory hierarchydirectory hierarchymapping hierarchybinary hierarchy lines hierarchysymbol hierarchycharacter hierarchywild card hierarchyobject hierarchyshapes hierarchycolor hierarchy numeric hierarchymathematical hierarchyalphabet hierarchyalpha / numeric hierarchyalpha hierarchybeta hierarchyalpha  beta hierarchybeta  alpha hierarchylanguage hierarchycommunications hierarchywordsentenceparagraphpunctuationacronyms hierarchyabbreviations hierarchyclocks hierarchytime hierarchyscales hierarchymeasures hierarchyweights hierarchydensity hierarchywidth hierarchylength hierarchyheight hierarchythickness hierarchyspace hierarchyarea  hierarchyparameter hierarchydiameter hierarchycircumference hierarchyspeed hierarchyvelocity hierarchytrajectory hierarchycoordinates hierarchyordinates hierarchysectors hierarchyvectors hierarchysound hierarchylight hierarchyelectricity hierarchymatter hierarchyanti -

one line capitals the second lower case, starting with a,atheir should be 10 pages - one for each finger before moving to the next letter .should have a ring binder to place your pages, this procedure should be repeated until grade 2 or 3 but if the child fingers are strong enough to move to true hand position and learn to type.in this way the child can learn the alphabet and begin to learn their spelling. family learning for quality time.               start in grade 2 or 3              -

programing - communications step procedures

programing - communications step procedures good day people : note:in creating a your symbols, character, wild cards from scratch , you design in  pencil, pencil crayons, crayons, pastels, pens. felts, you should use extra fine tip, fine tip, basic, medium, bold, extra bold on white different color sheets of paper and transparencies in different fonts sizes, the layout for alphabet on same paper and 1 paper page with one image at a time non cut outs and cut outs  .creating your own home made blue screens and different color screens  boxes for primary and secondary colors  or be able to change background material to allow special effects to photograph and video camera, also create screens with pinholes for natural light and color admittance, in lighted room with different wattage bulbs and colored bulbs, also in dark room, you may want to repeat the pinhole boxes for different size pinholes and this way you can use optical fibers and laser lightsthe images of top and bottom front and back, left and right of the image in different positions, this will help when using spot light like batman single projection also opposite concept  , overhead projector, slide projector and laser projector.this will allow you to make objectsslide projector - dots, dots to line to create rulers and scales measures laser projection - dots, dots to line to create rulers and scales measuresthis is part of hollow matrix projectiontrue font creation towards computer development programming computers are electrical signals that use sonar = sound depth / radar = air sound  and echo = location and repeat thus sound into long or short dots / blips to lines to morse code with braille and is interpreted by the control interaction of mathematical calculations to a image flash plate that will create an image object that can be projected to the screen and refreshed by echo repeat. __________________________________________________________________________________________________               in the development of a program to ensure function of operations it is to important to understand in how the computer will communicate internally with it self and externally with other systems, it is also important in the system will interact with the human user and the the human user to the computer. the concept of programing code or computer languages to for function operations or applications is more that simply typing as that their are paramus of communication structure to take place or the program will not function.the concept of computer programing is sets of instructions and the tasks to perform within the criteria of of the instruction, however their is a multitude of instructions that will take place for the task to be preformed.to make things easy in a way that can be understood we will use comparative examples between computer and people and this should bring clarification to the problem and give better understanding.as computers do not behave or think like human beings one must take that into consideration when programing.computers do not have a conscience or a sub-conscience in this is the steps of andro-robotics concepts thinking stage computer brain storage = hard drivecomputer brain = components -

reality graphics - understanding monitor programming

reality graphics -understanding monitor programming good day people:note:  not for sales or distribution for economic gains. the love of graphics, one of the most enjoyable aspects to t.v., computers, videos, and gaming but the most frustrating aspects for any newbie to computer programing or computer graphics designer, the major problems when it comes home developers or those just wanting to have fun in designing art graphics is the interaction of cartoon graphics or v.r. graphics with real or a.r. graphics and the control of inanimate to animate or non-motion to motion graphics is that most hardware and software designed by engineers use word terms or symbols most newbies never herd of or used but for most will get the hang of in no time regardless. the real problems for most is the cost for the higher end graphics programs but even then they don't do much more other than higher cost, one of the other problems is file conversion where you may need to interact between 1 or more graphics programs.as for most graphics designers is without fail the effect or capability you wish to perform is not an option on the software you have and after downloading 3 or more programs in which in many cases link you to that sever for use or leave tracking cookies, all the same extensions may not allow file transfer or when you do that the object graphics will not respond to the functions you desire. so what dose this have to with the monitor, you might be asking your self,  " well simple " it is the placement of display of the data to be presented and is major event placement for your enjoyment.so in the explanation of graphics display and real color and better graphics the way the monitor functions and how the p.c. functions with programing data will interact .       computer monitor monitor screen - line control here is where you see the display of the images but behind the scenes of the screen is the projection of sound and light signals to produce the lines that are measured in standard or metric to units or pixel measurements, some may have called pixels dots .before creating line movements you need a pixel key chart, the chart helps to organize security codec and programing code and check system code, in fact it helps layer placement and organization.the chart should be done with standard blank paper and the same size transparency and should be scaled for the size computer screen and should include the outside parameter margin boarder for visible or invisible ( hidden ) mastery control to help with magnification and background, and foreground operations.marginsmargin frame -  allows instruction for margin boarderengineers - master level 4 use visible by security commandbasic users - invisible or hidden from main view of screen - not accessiblemargins are used for pr-instruction of alphabet and numeric sequence like a times table, this helps to control the page layers and underlay and overlay display points - pixels ( dots ). margin boarder the margin boarder - allows instruction to the floating margin engineers - master level 3 use, only visible by security commandfloating margin floating margin can be activated by user owner administrator by passwordthe screen contains within the floating margin space and is the ares of viewing.when floating margin is activated allows a control menu for viewing options and basic info.viewing options multiple screenscolor control systemsound controli/o devices - specified devices only  - recording devices  - cameras - photo and videoline movements horizontal line -dots by visual focus is like that of a car at the distance of the horizon but as you get closer the object is revealed to be a car. the concept of analog screens is limited but with increased technology over the years in visual display the ability of digital programing has opened up the door to how knowledge can be stored and projected to the screen.with concepts of zano space - zanixels inside nano space - nanixels inside the micron space of pixels is the goal but for present time developers of other companies look to improve nano technology.as for me at home at this time be lucky to work with improved concepts of pixels, however some concepts of nano can be indicated by comparison as i do not have nano lab in the bedroom.   dots to lines l = lines#'s = columns      1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,l 1  .....................................l 2  .....................................l 3  .....................................l 4  ...................................... l 5  .......................................l 6 ........................................l 7  .......................................l 8   .......................................l 9  .............................motion light sequencer independent -

hardware and programing1.) in the concepts of hardware and software security  programming for personal systems that should never be linked to internet providers that is not ones own satellites and ground stations this should always be created scratch.2.) in the creating hardware and software to link for internal systems base only should have no outside link system to internet and should contain from scratch principals.note :   if 1 emergency and 1 - 3 bases -  base was developed  in every province and state of the world, that 7 continent + 1 adult entertainment + 1 news + 1 banking = 10 warehouses, the warehouses built in this method of concepts below, and that for transmitters for up satellites separated from down satellites to the receivers, however the warehouses that the communications out for each floor and for each country has transmitter with own frequencies and channels and separated receivers with it's own frequencies and channels from down satellites. the satellite to satellite out going transmitter is different than incoming receiver transmissions from each other and if they where built in the saucer concept that i had mentioned this should reduce the hack external problem by 99 % and the internal problem by 87% but with knew concept these problems should never be a problem again.3.) in creating a base location for outside connection to competitive internet providers for better protection. the base should contain 7massif warehouses for 7 continents. the warehouse be labeled and numbered for identification for each continentthe continent warehouse contains country rooms that run perpendicular of the building, aligned on each floor to floor.the country room is sectioned into level rooms for international, federal  state, county, province, providence, municipal the level rooms contain it's own internal computer main frame center systems .the main frames independently designed specifically for music, music video, video, t.v. photo's, movies, games, video games in the entertainment room or section office mainframe / business mainframe, science mainframe, medical mainframe, fire forces mainframe, security mainframe, education mainframe, law enforcement mainframe, government mainframe, unemployment main frame, dental mainframe, video mainframe, photo's mainframe, sound track mainframe. internet communications      the internet communications room are independent run from the 4th floor, the security communications floor monitors all incoming and outgoing communications of lan wan and satellite from this floor to each floor for the country country and contains 2 smaller rooms, ( 2  rooms ) = 1.) incoming, 2.) outgoing for  for internet services.capitalist countries be separated from communist countries by left side and right side warehouse building with own hallways and entrances and exits, electrical and plumbing, furnace ventilation systems, back up systems .the floor levels will be organized * ( what makes it work is the design ) !!!basement =main floor = 1st floor = civilian floor, 2nd floor = religion floor  3rd floor = political floor, 4th floor = security floorarmed force floors 5th floor = army 6th floor = navy 7th floor = marines 8th floor = air force 9th floor = space program10th floor = judicial11th floor = joint intelligence12th floor = armed forces business- land =army navy air force, marines space program  own rooms for each country/ land an sea =  army navy air force, marines, space program / land / sea and air = army navy air force, marines, space program/ land air, sea and space =   army navy air force, marines, space program      note : -

reality graphics

reality graphicsgood day peopleyou seen many of the applications used such as gimp or fire fox and internet explorer browsers used on your system, and that the colors and graphics tend to be cartoon like or bitmap graphics.1,) one of the main reasons for this is security levels dealing with users to color graphics as the color graphics are a shared code between hardware and software that decisions were made by engineers and software developers.    2.) the second reason comes from the trust levels of employers to employees from what is called company moles or spies.3.) the third reason is that outside companies, as proven that individuals use codes such e-mail and color to access entry to pixel manipulations through refresh rates and % codecs when paralleling or bridging streams . 4.) the forth reason is that many graphics companies in applications and video games and music videos will outside support programmers in the development of their software and quite often their is individuals that attempt to embed code.5.) in past some company employee's that have been fired have been found to sell out or hack info.6.) security companies and some companies have hired some employee's in past with a criminal records or second chance systems in some cases revert to their old ways or where vulnerable by manipulation or temp/abductions.7.) intelligence agencies civilian and military from time to time have used back doors with basic tricks of graphics cards and colors in history as code of the processor must calculate to send to monitor for user the graphics card is part of the circuit or gateway and what passes through from p.c.  to monitor code changes of hardware and software so that recognition of data to be displayed. 8.) in engineering development to hardware code is passed to security and encryption code and deciphering code for engineers, tech and user levels with use of color codes in reset or cut and paste embedded, and spell and grammar checker, with so many codes most developers nest their code for quick changes which leads vulnerable access in default settings with on board chip set as with the software the code must be known to interact with graphics display. 9.) in the use of any hardware the frequency to sound or the speed of sound that is measured for check systems that the code structure to morse code to 1 and zeros used by advanced hacks to gain access of security codecs to a processor and on-board chip-set to the mother board  towards the graphics card, as the graphics card must be read for error check and report to see function from on board pc system to monitor graphics input to output and graphics display that the graphics used for the code must pass to be read.10. ) is their a way to prevent this problem ? yes and how, you don't tell people how !!!real color graphicsin the use of real color pictures of outside environments or objects such as cars for example:in the use of real pictures you need to create a folder file system to help create your color pallet. if you are creating from scratch you will need to make your security codes for users ownership, engineers, techs for developing company  and for each user type application home, home business, business, private business, office, and gaming for the civilian that will differ from religion, political and military hardware and software, but also for pc users as owner, immediate family, family, friend, common, user, client, customer, employee, shopper, banker, with the different color pallets with its own fonts and size control, spell and grammar checker and object allowance with security check.           to reduce folder spacephoto and video folders for pencil, pencil crayons, crayons, felt pens, felt markers, pastels, paint types, dies, inks to contain high quality pictures of their use wet and dry of different surfaces and back grounds in the folder of 1 dimensional  and should be structured 1 - 9 dimensional dots folder lines folderstaggered lines foldertwo lines foldercircle folderhollow circle foldertriangle foldersquare folderrectanglechevronspentagons folderhexagonsetc.the above folders should contain the light, shadow, and dark color folderand each three should contain all the colorsnow comes the long process of of restructuring the layers of the colors to the dots, lines and shapes.how ?with the pictures of real objects you get real color and if you used a microscope or a telescope for magnification control  can add more detail by creating a small dot from the image by cutting and de-magnification (reducing ) the color still is present but now you have to control the size of dots for the size of lines you need to make and with dots and lines you make shapes and object with the color do you have the equipment to show how it is done in a video.personal or private networks should contain their own color pallets from that for online use computer systems as tags and flags can be used as back doors.to get professional a.r. graphics in animations you have to create the program from scratchthe pictures are above are one dimensional by the type of editing software use you can copy or cut and edit or rotate and paste when you align your objectscopy and cut to make objects then print objects to apply to a 2 dimensional sized object or 3d object and photograph then scan then you will have the colored object of your choice.was looking for a simple draw or draft program that could allow the above images to create a box cube  just by cut and paste locations to give a 3d effect. the problem their is the codes of other software to personal system safer to design ones ownbut easier to print of and cover a box  with your color and take pictures from different angles to capture the dimension you want . old concepts of cut paste to objects color objects, and colored objects with blue screens compared to localized laser light projection.adam antle

encyclopedias

good day peoplewill be giving some rough ideas and layouts for encyclopedia pages and layouts.it is a very slow process for templates for encyclopedia book library program.the idea in concept !!by right clicking chapter will advance to next chapter.by right clicking the photo, will take you to photo page.by right clicking encyclopedia gives encyclopedia format page.by right clicking quick answer, gives quick answer page.by right clicking inventor gives the original inventor.by left clicks gives drop down menu box for options.  - example question box - put in a question and get an answer.  - get narration option or braille etc.  - left click picture and get video options. - by left clicking computer history change the history to present or future concepts.the concept in actual reality graphics and virtual reality graphics with animations and simulator - in the development one should be aware the engineering design of the library and the technician side  to that of the users allowances in changing and programing and allowed interactions.with these booklets it dose not show the alphabet index and table of contents as yet as it should,  also dose  not show the interaction section tabs  .the background interactions of the library like tron or matrix concepts, with the books as you in real life to look and feel is the interaction of the program but keep in mind c.o.b.i.m.m. and new born to seniors of gender so that it appeals to all people and ages.thank youadam antle

weapons of defense

weapons of defense good day people note: not for sales or distribution for personal gains for actual weapons usage.            - only as to agreement indicated to the page, in the use for books, comic books,             t.v., movies, video games and puzzles if you choose.  not for use - e - books, internet, model kits, electrical model kits,                         remote control electronics  permission of change - must be written authorization authorization must be by adam d. antleremember you build it, and what you put into it you get out of it. !! shared ideas to help people, not just one self, greed can be found anywhere.   in the history of mankind of the many governments in the protection of their citizens rights and global marketing to sustain their capitalist empires, wars have been wagered for lands and resources at the cost of human life and civilizations in the striving to better their chances development of attack weapons such as catapults, cross bows and swords, and with their scientists and philosophers learning of the enemies from spies to gain strategic maneuvers that would weaken their enemy and with their alchemists creating poisons and chemical weapons not much has changed except the price over the years as billions upon billions of dollars is spent  in the sciences of weaponry technology to find ways to make better weapons of attack.some of the most deadly weapons known to man are nuclear and atomic weapons that moved into proton and ion weapons, in the advancement of technology the advancement of computers to aid in the the robotic research to make micro-bots, nano-bots, and with the levels of technology was kept in check.the technology of yesterday for world equality in balanced check is no longer case as developments are advancing in many countries into zanite technology over the british empire and the united states with their allies, they now realize they have fallen behind and with internal problems of gangs and major criminal organizations, more than ever look to find new ways to infiltrate and create laws to gain control world wide, the problem as the more constraint with computer spy networks from government and private an civil business sectors creates more conflict and with added cost of inflated education and medical which forces increased criminal numbers increases the undercurrent.weapons of defense is really what is needed but with the growing control in with the underworld in drugs and weapons, and the long old problem of prostitution in which has moved into the adult and teen dating and porn industries able to gain lots of quick cash and reinvest to controlled education strategy to move their players into the music and movie industries for some where others into government jobs of social services, law enforcement, medical services and legal business such as computers,electronics and auto mechanics with the aid of  wealthy individuals from party and sex memberships connected to political positions, not much resistance over the last couple of years from basic residence as that many of their own children are part of some undercurrent known by gang members.the heavy organizations and hitters have been monitoring the problems and began to crack down on the wild chickens to bring back control to the farming of the proceeds.all the same looking for the advantage and the cutting edge of technology and the design of new weapons but draw back form some is capital so new ways to gain funds and improve on weapons.in several concepts of weapon advantages - was to look at sound and light waves to control positive and negative charge and use the atoms of the atmosphere to add or drain atoms of power or cause a chain reaction.to create subliminal messages in sound and light waves using the air molecules to bounce signals by refractionto create sound and light waves in ultra sound in ultra space and sub space to destroy the human brainmorebut these are all possible and createin all these devices the construct is relatively simple, however the organizing the correct sequences to the the right source energy waves and it's combinations and to block interfering signals.sound devices needed  - recording devices - with sound the need to duplicate repetitive exact wave and source, energy, power, and frequencies, is different than similar waves with phase variances     - primary and secondary with main, back up, emergency, and extra recording devices   - in the development of recording devices in the mechanical, mechanical electrical to electric currency flow of field distortion can be a major problem if not designed right as can interfere with magnetic fields in magnetic electrical and electrical magnetics -

governments and legal authority

governments and legal authority good day people,canada screwed by historical policiesfor the first year of his life, george was the only heir to the german territories of his .... the holy roman empire, the united dutch provinces, england, hanover and ... in response the english parliament passed measures which threatened to ...in understanding a government one must have an open mind, and is a concept that should be on both sides as the government political positions and the people of the society .with a government in forming of today's society, the persons who look to form a government structure should take in consideration of the damage people have faced in history with other forms of governments,  the major conflicted problems of people in the trust towards a government as they have been traumatized in the history by slavest forms of political leaderships.in the history of slavest leaderships that sustained their power by abuse of slavery and take overs by militarization such as in the days of the roman empire, pharaohs of egypt, and the spanish conquistadors , powers of the old world a much colder cruller time of civilizations that would partake in the forming of the barter trade system and the trade routes that predate roman empire, pharaohs of egypt, and the spanish conquistadors but if you study you will see that many of the wars surround the trade routes and the right to enter the market and the conflicts to changing economic systems such as the 1000 years war and the discovery of the new world.the best way to understanding authority and how it becomes a legal authority is to break down the principal concepts and explain how they come together to function correctly and show how incorrect functions make it wrong or abusive .what is authority and how is it established in a civil humane manner ?what is the differences between verbal and written authority ?who has authority ?how do you use authority ?how can you gain authority ?how can you give authority ?how can you gain more authority ?what is imposed authority ?how can imposed authority be wrong ?how can imposed authority be right ?the authority of personal self defense ?the authority of personal preempt strike or attack ?what is supersede authority ?what individual or group can supersede authority legally to non member outside their country ?personal authorityfamily authority education authority business authority dose true independent authority exist without some else's control ? - if not where's the freedom ?born in captivity to some else's debt ?establish time lines and pictorial descent of the roots family descendents and the positions of claimed authoritarian power from time of mans first existence to the current date.determine the common tutors, private tutors, private schools and public schools from the beginning of the concept of education for the time period and compare the time periods of education and leadership positions.placement for academia, athletics, arts, skills of defense.    human rights disability rights legal  rightslegal authority legal change of bills and lawslegal change of government legal change to government system legal change to legal systemhow the legal system got the right to impose punishments with out signatures how government gained the right to suppress or inform from levels and ranks how militarization can take over the control of citizens rights how laws are formed temp laws what the limitations how to legally control non membership citizens government authority ? as a reminder to the concept of the quick answer encyclopedia it was a concept to organize for interactive booklet the pages per chapter are like individual windows or quick tabs, the time line interactive concept has to be structured per item and page to chapters of book and to books of the library and interact to the libraries of the concept, the efficiency comes form the applied codec interaction to the item in identification of the item index as example long sentence with full words compared to short hand, well with codec identification to the item is shorter than short hand so response time is lessor but  is limited so with the time line identification software applied to screen and differs for the size of screen that allows more time lines to the bigger screen and the input for comparison differences. so a 30 inch screen compared to a 500ft. screen is slower by the lessor time line comparative .  the improvements if done is that the book is part of cell and and the the library is a cell that interacts with the different libraries working like a human brain but with photographic memory and with theory probability to act like esp strategic.   as with computer be different than an android brain in processing data the concept of the book is more complex for processing as the computer side structure to that of human engineers, techs, and programer side to that of the types of users and the application interaction purposes in the over all programming.  with today's computers is still like commodore 64 or cp3o to that of commander data but looking to advance the concept beyond commander data.levels

freedom of speechinternet censorship  when any individual person(s) or group organizes for the purpose of prosecution, without the evidence becomes bios slander and is redeemed a one sided view, when a view may insight aggression or bring-fourth deadly violence as result of misleading information's  then the government can place an emergency temporary band and launch an investigation to determine if the site is a profession or non professional site and if the placement of comments to the site is professionally web paged or a gossip blog, if the site and the pages are considered to be professional then they should be sustained with professional ethics and the information's gathered be truthful and credible and represent all views of parties without bios.when it comes to the internet if a gossip site with gossip blog is structured and placed with gossip blogged warning ( enter at own risk ) that the site may contain some truth or mostly all b.s. then it has been contained by the individuals to enter at own risk like any t.v. or radio warning on adult ratings such as sexual nudity.the concept of freedom blogging  of opinions should be reflected in and too the comment given by the writer of that comment, and if claimed to be a real event the evidence even if blog site, meaning professional sites and blog sites by the owner and client are accountable for slander if not truthful and if not appropriately explained from fact or fiction.government civilian sites, should be bookleted  and with public client membership and be introduced with video introduction on the rules regulations on the ethics to remain on the site for comments and be separated from security and law enforcement booklets.military government sites for public and off duty ours  introduced with video introduction on the rules regulations on the ethics to remain on the site for comments and be separated from security and law enforcement booklets. these systems should not be part active national security systems and still be separated from adult content and gaming sites, and adult systems kept from gaming systems of children and preteensgovernment military      the armed forces should be on their own satellites and internet systems that be different from homeland security or federal government as that civilian enforcement is not armed forces security and is not an active member.with civilian satellites and sites key and tagged words on weapons or murder and drug sales that involve military personal be an automatic reported if activated as that the level and rank of military personal may become a security risk or danger to public safety but if like con-air, even though i am a civvy, " my opinion " in the movie con - air they should of all been shot for trying to sexual assault and assault without provocation  "  so if verbally or physically challenged if a military person kicks ass to a civilian tuff but if the military personal is a command freak, defend your self if need be but should first report to the commanding officer at hq . investigation organization's investigation's on civilians by military or civilian legal authority organizations need to prove that they are containing true legal authority that was granted by true legal authority and has formed by the correct legal authority procedures and have the correct legal identification under contracted agreement from the true source of legal authority or be considered a vigilante or vigilante group.this means the history of the time line of the beginning source of true authority and not imposed bullied or enslaved dominated force.news satellites and public news sites the ability to gather the news and keep true to the events of the first amendment rights, should be amended by legal procedures in government on cases of abduction and murder or to investigation's ongoing or active that may jeopardized by the timing of news release. the protection of source do to corruption be kept secret, however if the claim is proven wrong that set-forth person(s) be given up on the basis of slander, interference to an investigation and that the blogger, columnist,  reporter, writer or journalist as well as the company be faced by legal prosecution.all individuals blogger, columnist,  reporter, writer or journalist be legally registered with security and contain a security smart press member card or face legal prosecution this will slow down intruders. - law breakers to gain a story or in collaboration with known criminals can face charges.spies and organizations that spy civilian - claimed organization's amongst the civilian public society, where illegal methods of investigation are taken place to prosecute if proven is tainted evidence military - spies are not investigators and if cought on forign soil are dealt in the accordance of the law. but if smart should be imprisoned and their profile and photo's placed over the internet and then they can never serve again.education - spies with cover or training facilities for the purpose to carry out illegal missions are just that illegal .celebrities - before, during and after the great world wars, people in many countries.  new's - in many companies and news station's investigation's is how news is gathered but over the years members had duel function, 1) for the news station investigation 2) and cover for intelligence organization's  and this be differ from working undercover from other news stations to investigate or gather insider information's of news stations called a mole or corporate spy. political, religious and military views or unwanted headlines may have been suppressed as one of their duties. double identities - legal change of name or impersonation of identity for cover be illegal use internally and externally to a country and is a breach of the geneva convention and the united nation's security act's for unlawful means -

england, cia - united states, interpol, mss - china, isi - pakistan, mossad – israel, bnd – germany, fsb – russia, dgse – france, raw – india, asis – australia, and canada - csis informants fences, streets and businessdealers - weapons, drugs, alcohol  models and prostitutesstudentsworkers - co workersmoles and plantsskills and trainingssupport sourcespoliticsnewsmedialibrariesfinancial institutionsundercover procedures learn to know the procedures of whats legal and illegal procedures used by law enforcement agencies and compare it to criminal behavior.spy tools and equipment why society has growing concern to their community and countries procedures and the use of the internet by creating an encyclopedia concept is a neat way to catalog and understand the history and inventors of these devices, but is a good thing to learn how to detect them.spy computer hardware and software learn about -what is the difference between professional and and basic systems ?who are the people that make run and install the hardware and software?who repairs and upgrades the systems ?the levels of authority internal and external of the company ?how can you buy your own or learn to make ?if you create your own as 1 to share ware and the 2nd to be private must you share information's of your private if you have your own satellites and ground stations ?the electronic world, the internet where people loose them selves to escape the every day life in video games and music, where others will look to buy and sell or just get off in their perversions monitored by those in fear that people may be enjoying themselves or plotting some crime as they watch to persecute and get their satisfaction as they look to maintain the capital enterprise just to find out that they are few in numbers and as they begin to notice that their own family members are addicted to the electronic age and just as perverse with or without electronic devices and in truth are no different in their own fantasies with their partner and the games they play for their own excitement. spying becomes their reality outlet but the claim of doing good for the right cause to justify their actions as they probe the system breaking all the rules to get their perk.video game conceptone of the biggest problems to the internet is junk satellites floating in space around functional satellite systems and zoning. in the history i had mentioned a concept of satellite design that could reduce many of the problems, however  gaming satellite, music satellite, video satellites, business satellites, chat room satellite, and different from adult entertainment satellite,  as you see become congested to space but if saucer sectioned and designed to satellite stations and cubed positions to the earth would be faster communications as direct line pattern.if development of a 1000 games for deficit only gain from every country of the world that covers all categories kids teens, adults, family for female gender, male gender and co-ed gender per age group but engineered like war of witch craft - play against the computer one to one, one to two, one to three, couples or groups.from what was mentioned above - a spy game, or cowboys and indians, knight of shinning armor, warped time are all possible concepts.               one rule of thumb, never  use online systems to do your work and never use an online system in your living space if you up to know good as a hack or spy or rely on a secure base.   thank youadam

about true legal authority

good day people:when the earth came into existence and life was non existent then it is plain to see that mankind had no legal authority, and as with life and it's beginning told through the history of the uncivilized, and the forming road to civilization that concepts of civil and humane behavior go hand in hand but when it comes to legal authority and the legal right of position to give to humanity, who has given unto the flesh to be the first person on earth and the evidence that is legal.  when it comes to england and forming of the new world, it is plain to see that slavery is not legal by abuse and goes against the concepts of civil and humane.points of view if a citizen or group has no legal authority and forms a government is that legal ?if the the people who make up a government has no legal authority, is it legal to make a security group or law enforcement agency. ?if such security group or law enforcement agency exists from a non legal government and follows laws made by the government to impose on people that are non members and arrest and imprison them legal for not obeying that government ?if the person(s) or groups takes the law in their own hands to stop such a government that is illegal from imposing their so called laws is this a crime ?dose this action make them vigilante. ?what prof dose a government have to show that they are of legal authority ?and who has to have legal authority to grant the people to be government members?so what prof of evidence do this group or individual have show to prove that they have authority ? and can give such a authority ?what is the source that makes canada's government legal when it was first created ? and where did they get it ?in other words if people who do not have legal authority how can they give it to those who do not have it to be in government and if government dose not have it to authorize others to have and administer.so back in the day to the dates of kings who were instated and passed down with coronation in england to the shores of the new world containing their vigil rule by slavery and considered them selves as civil and humane, where such king of business deal of lands relinquishes onto queen, old and new britney ( britannia ), old and new england separatists and loyalists, and french separatists, where that king gave no backing of the kingdoms authority for their lack of loyalty - the dates of a king who relinquishes all of rights as king onto forming english parliament that dissolves or relinquish the kingdoms assets but as for the lands in canada not part of the kingdom as it was given up by a king to a queen - as it was the end of contract of in-statement, it would be in england a new agreement contract for a king and queen to reinstatement by england's people on what date ? but was the original group to reinstate the king and queen ? and was the king full active and the kingdom. ? why not ?english reinstated royalty brought to canada to restructure contracts accords and treaties. ?when king and kingdom authority dissolved as relinquishment into england's parliament power was the loss or end of the original agreements the english had to act fast or loose all from canadian gains ?why would england loose all in canadian , it's simple when king gives to queen, loyalists and separatists the lands and distances the kingdom and the authority, that england and canada becomes 2 separate entities.the king when relinquishes to the forming england parliament is about a king kings subjects if title placement  and kingdom assets and the right of england's people self governing.with reinstatement to keep the control of england over legal lands and the lands gained by war ( the spoils of war ) to the control of minerals and resources, however old en-statement agreements of end contracts be differ to new reinstatement agreements but with prep work of the loyalists on canadian shores they royals would be back for signatures .how many times has any member of the royal family been to canada and the dates? what signatures other than royal members to sign any documents.?you would think by now any land bought from the queen in canada that would be paid for ?i was told their was a time that their was no taxes in canada, if so when ?if no taxes ever paid in canada, when did it start, and why ?dose any tax money ever go to the queen or england ?dose any taxes from canada go to rome or any where else for that matter ?  if any lands gained from the spoils of war containing minerals and resources, what is the % that goes to england or the queen and who manages it ?what do the loyalists in canada gain from england and the queen or canadian government, and what is their occupations ?in the forming history of the new world, who are separatists and the number of followers in each group and the ranking system. ?for loyalists and separatists and loyalists, create a pictorial tree for each member and a family tree going backwards and forwards of time !to create a family tree structure for concubines and consort members, slavests, servants, servant slaves, slaves, slave servants - ( prisoners bitch ). ?the concepts of business management differ from ownership management, how ?authority concepts parental authority ?parental security authority ?personal authority ?personal security authority ?security authority ?political  authority ?political security authority ?government security ?government security authority ?security agencies authority ?security agencies ?law enforcement security authority ?law enforcement authority ?law enforcement ?armed forces / military security authority ?armed forces . military authority ?armed forces ?religion security authority ?religion security ?religion authority ?religion orders and sects ( sections ) ?for each concept heading above for it's library and encyclopedia concept !remember to individualize the secretaries and the adviser, council and committee's time lines for comparative of self organizations and to each other to different time periods from history to date and current date to history to check for inconsistencies.from top to bottom of each organization from the time they began and the time of no authority on earth as human life began make a pictorial tree of the first person(s) or group to all those who began to give others authority up to today's current date.of the all the original laws rules and regulations of the dates formed and by whom, and the dates of any changes or amendments, and what may have been added or strickened  from the original laws, rules and regulations and when and by whom ?also the punishments for breach or violations too.. ?cross check to slavests, servants, servant slaves, slaves, slave servants. ?also the ranks and levels to leadership positions ?civil and humane concepts human rights ?civil rights ?imposed authority peace ?war ?cold war ?imposed punishments imposed taxes without agreed signature or contract agreement failures to comply punishments ?it is said that not even lucifer can take a soul without contract ?signatures of the deceased ?what's the point, simple it helps to organize education strategy and business strategy to understand your competitors, as not all look to accept entry of new business they look for weakness and strengths to knock out or gain allies by knowing what could be their enemy.as business world is not always legal playground people look for skeletons in the closet, you will usually see this at times of elections called mud slinging to knock campaign competition out of vote arena.or back in the day protection rackets, cops on the pad and those on the take.what most people do to day, is crime stoppers and american most wanted but usually when it comes to some criminals they give up other groups or enemy gang members in making deals for freedom and cash gains.however some gang members and criminal organizations, back in the day use to create data base tree's to know the good ones for scam mark or if a problem then targets but knowing rich from poor uptown and downtown.in today's world knowing the history may just help your chances to real players from the hustlers.any successful organization has to know the field and the potential enemies for survival. a new design for military computer processor and mainframe system if structured be better than u.s. and china. - new weapon design take out human life only.more later.
