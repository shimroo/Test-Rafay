it had to be felt #76: asai katsuaki: "like a safecracker"

     posted 2/17/2022 7:16pm [from jun akiyama]
the latest "it had to be felt" essay is now available for your reading pleasure, this time on asai katsuaki (8th dan, aikikai deutschland), written by markus rohde (5th dan, aikidoschule essen).
 
 from the essay: "asai sensei once told us that when he attacked o-sensei, his body moved because he was drawn into that movement, before he could understand why. taking ukemi for asai sensei often approaches that; he definitely possesses some degree of this attracting force. you really get the feeling to be taken, and being required to stick to him."
