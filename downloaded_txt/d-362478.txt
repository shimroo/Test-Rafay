in its early history, britain was subjected to many 
    invasions and migrations from scandinavia and the continent. the romans 
    occupied britain for several centuries. the normans, the last of a long 
    succession of invaders, conquered england in 1066.
    under the normans, 
    pre-celtic, celtic, roman, anglo-saxon and norse influences  blended 
    into the briton of today. in addition to the ethnic groups indigenous to the 
    british isles, immigration in the past few decades has added large numbers 
    of africans, europeans, and south asians to the british 
    population. london, the capital,
    is one of the largest cities in europe and a center of international 
    commerce, education and the arts.
    the london diplomatic corps consists of about 2,000 members and the consular 
    corps has some 125. each november, the queen hosts a formal evening 
    reception at buckingham palace or windsor castle for heads of mission and 
    diplomatic staff.
