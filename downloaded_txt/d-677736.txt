create a pet profile that is linked to a q-tag.


the profile
start by creating a profile for your dog or cat. your pet profile contains owner info and pictures of your pet so that it can be identified. the profile will automatically be linked to a qr code.


the q-tag
scan the q-tag with any smartphone to reveal the pet profile of the animal. think of it as a very powerful pet tag. phone number, address, owner info and identifying images...all on a single tag!

if your pet is lost, the q-tag is scanned and pet info is displayed.


lost pet
if your dog or cat is ever lost, the q-tag can be scanned by any smartphone to reveal the pet profile. with all contact information available immediately, you can be reunited with your pet faster than ever.


better than a microchip
the q-tag saves families from having to explore expensive, invasive and unaffordable alternatives such as micro-chipping or animal tracking implants.
