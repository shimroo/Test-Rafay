hi!!! my name is andrew guidroz ii and i live in opelousas, louisiana. this is the heart of cajun country!!!





















































[opelousas, louisiana]








i have a lot of different interests. i program for a living using primarily clarion for windows from softvelocity corporation.
and i also love to cook. all of us here in louisiana put a strong emphasis on cooking --- especially crawfish. and being cajun makes it all that much more special. 
oh, about the raccoon!! a friend of mine named robby richard (we pronounce that ree --- shard) drew it for me. he draws very well by hand and was just really starting to learn how to draw using a pc when he drew it. i think he does a fantastic job!! 
check out the "why coonass.com?" link to find out the story about the coon and why this page is located at http://www.coonass.com.
 















thanks for coming by. i hope you enjoy your visit. if you get a minute, drop me a note . the pirogue comes down the bayou real regular!
