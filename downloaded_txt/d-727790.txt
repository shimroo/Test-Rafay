our history
in 1997, florham park (nj) police officer patrick montuore had a simple idea: organize a four-day bicycle ride from new jersey to washington, dc to raise public awareness about law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty, and to ensure that their sacrifice is never forgotten.
with that, the police unity tour was formed.
what started with 18 riders on a four day fund-raising bicycle ride from florham park, nj to the national law enforcement officers memorial in washington, d.c. has grown into 8 chapters consisting of nearly 2,100 members nationwide who make the trip annually.
