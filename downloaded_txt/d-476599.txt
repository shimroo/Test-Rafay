nationally recognized photojournalist, model and actress, jinsey brings her fun-loving personality to every facet of her photography work. "by all accounts, jinsey dauk is one of the most successful headshot photographers in new york city.”  — eric rudoph, photo district news"you're fun! you're funny! and you understand what kids like!"— brittyn, satisfied 5yr old client “you don’t see the things you photograph. you feel them!”— andré kertész

















“however she does it, whether it’s by relaxing people or her use of lighting, jinsey has the ability to catch people in the candid moment when they are relaxed and their eyes, which have to communicate 90% of the personality, have a bright and alert look to them even if the person is not smiling." - casting director anita guerra
