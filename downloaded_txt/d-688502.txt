water's edge 312

we loved the beach! walking to the pier, looking for shells, and sitting on the balcony. we enjoyed broadway at the beach, the marsh walk, and eating at river city cafe and drunken jack's. 
the condo is great! we enjoyed all of the decorations and amenities. the beds were comfy and my kids enjoyed your movies on these rainy afternoons.

casual on the beach

prior to closing on our home, ashley and the garden city realty team had already exceeded our expectations. their team has made every aspect of renting our home an effortless venture. they have helped us every step of the way and bend over backward to see that we’re happy. not only are they extremely helpful but they managed to rent my home at amazing rates for the entire summer in under a week’s time!  my family and i are able to have peace of mind knowing that ashley is overseeing our beach home in all regards.

hakuna matata

i can honestly say, my experience with garden city realty has been nothing short of exceptional. ashley and the owner services team, maintenance, and housekeeping have done an outstanding job managing and maintaining my oceanfront beach house. as a first-time beach property owner, i have been very pleased with the bookings, revenue, and maintenance performed on the house. even with the uncertainties surrounding the covid-19 pandemic of 2020, the team came up with a great plan and pulled through with an impressive number of bookings. i couldn’t ask for a better team to protect my investment.

the location is excellent, right on the beach. the kitchen is well equipped with pots, pans, dishes, etc. the beds are comfortable. we love eating lunch on the balcony and looking at the beautiful ocean views. my grandkids loved using both the indoor and outdoor pool. i highly recommend this unit.

amazing grace

we would definitely stay here again and hope to again next year.
house was great, and realty company was great. we loved staying at amazing grace. the walk to the beach was very easy and just a short stroll down the street. the pool was our favorite part; we were in the pool every afternoon. the screened-in front porch was perfect for eating breakfast and lunch. 
we had a great view of the ocean and the sunset over the marsh from the top patio. the house was very comfortable and felt like home. the beds were comfortable, and the place was roomy. 
very convenient and easy to get to murrells inlet from the house. the house was spotless when we arrived, and when we had one minor issue, the garden city realty was very responsive and fixed the issue fast. 
we would definitely stay here again and hope to again next year. it was great that we were able to bring our dog along with us on vacation. house was excellent, and the realty company was great.
