rapid city konvention updates and time sensitive information


with less than two months to go before the start of the 2024 state highpointers konvention from july 18th to 20th at the best western ramkota, this year’s chairperson would like to share some reminders and updates.
first, the deadline for receiving the discounted highpointers club group rate of $139 per night at the best western ramkota is june 1st.  while rooms may still be available after this date, regular rates will apply.  call the front desk at 1-605-343-8550 and mention that you are with the club!
second, we have an awesome t-shirt design for sd-24 and have contracted with a local shop in rapid city.  the t-shirts will bemade in las vegas, so we need to have a little bit of lead time to ensure they arrive in rapid city in time for the konvention.  the initial order will be submitted on june 10th so if you want your t-shirt guaranteed, be sure to register before monday, 6/10.  online registration here:
2024 highpointers konvention registration (sd-24) (regfox.com)
the final two items: the site of the watermelon feast on july 20th has been moved from sylvan lake to stockade lake adjacent to the george stockade, where we will have our own dedicated area.  tour buses will leave the ramkota at 10:30 am and return at 3:30 pm.  lastly, if you plan to attend the event at crazy horse memorial on 7/18 at 4 pm, please send a quick email to southdakotakonvention2024@gmail.com to let us know.  see you all in the black hills!

important update concerning charles mound access

a view from the highpoint of illinois
we are pleased to announce that we are able to confirm the summer open dates for 2024 at charles mound. the open dates will be:june 1-2july 6-7august 3-4september 7-8
just a reminder that this is private land, so please be respectful during your visit. the owners ask that, as before, you park on the road and walk from there, no vehicles on their lane, and no pets. please time your visit to occur during daylight hours. 
we want to once again thank the wuebbels for the many years of visitation and thank the new owners for continuing to graciously allow access.

issue 140 of apex to zenith is arriving in mailboxes now.  be on the look out for some fantastic content, information about the board of directors election, and the latest on our 2024 south dakota konvention!



important update on charles mound, the illinois highpoint



as some of you may know, the illinois highpoint, charles mound, is for sale. given the potential for new owners we are unable to confirm open access dates at this time. we are asking that highpointers do not visit until we can confirm the summer open dates. we will be updating the website as soon as we are able to get confirmation. we unfortunately cannot predict at this time when we may get final confirmation, so please take that into account when making your summer travel plans.
highpointers have had access to this location on open weekends over the past 21 years, and we have nothing but appreciation and gratitude to wayne and jean weubbels for allowing us access to their property all of these years.
the club hopes to establish a similar agreement with any new property owners. after new owners have had time to move in, we will hopefully be able to work out an agreement with them concerning access and confirm access dates. we ask that everyone respect this private property and all other highpoints on both private and public land.
we wish the wayne and jean nothing but the best in their future endeavors, and we hope any new property owners enjoy this special area for many years to come.
the following dates are the illinois access dates that are pending confirmation:
june 1st-2nd
july 6th-7th
august 3rd-4th
september 7th-8th
