1978-2017
thank you to everyone who over the 40 years has been involved with the dove singers – all of you who have attended performances, participated in performances, or prayed for us and the ministry.  we are forever grateful to jesus christ, our lord and savior, for giving us this opportunity to minister.
 

the dove singers is a non-denominational christian ministry, dedicated to presenting the word of god through music, drama, and dance.
dove singers background information
may the god who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow christ jesus, so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ. (romans 15:5-6, niv)
who we are
the dove singers is a nondenominational christian singing group representing dozens of different churches. we have gathered together to demonstrate the unity which is possible among believers in jesus christ, working in one accord for his glory.
what we do
the goal of the dove singers is to provide uplifting, encouraging christian musicals in our local area.
why we perform
we believe that the message of god’s love can be demonstrated convincingly through the power of music. we are persuaded that our cooperation and focus on the fundamentals that tie christians together can be an example to other christians, and to all people. also, we believe that we can encourage and support each other through some of life’s most difficult times.
this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe. there is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus. (romans 3:22-24, niv)
how we put it all together
we depend on the grace of god to provide us with singers, orchestra members, technical people, props, and the money we need to cover expenses. after each performance we will collect a freewill offering. your contributions are gratefully accepted, and will be used to further the ministry of the dove singers. for more information on supporting us, please see our ministries page.
an invitation
we invite you to come and see one of the performances this year. we also invite you to be a part of the dove singers by joining the group. also, we invite you to receive jesus christ as your personal lord and savior if you have not already done so.
