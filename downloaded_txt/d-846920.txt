   energy program update


 by jen barlow
•
july 14, 2022

green township has worked closely with our energy consultant energy alliances to evaluate options for renewing the program beyond june 2022.  due to a significant increase in energy prices since summer 2021 and particularly this past winter, energy alliances has recommended to the board of trustees not to lock into any prices at this time and to have all accounts on the program go back to duke's gcr rate staring with their july 2022 bill.
 




   

   thank you for sponsoring the independence day concert & fireworks in green township!!
