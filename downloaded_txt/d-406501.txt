south west youth community has been working in our local schools for over 20 years. during this time it has changed and morphed. as a church, through the spreydon youth community trust, we partner with local schools to provide youth workers to these schools. our youth work is provided under the ‘24-7youthwork’ network, which oversees youth work in over 80 schools across new zealand, and was birthed out of syc. syc has a group of youth workers that work an average of 10 hours per week, and commit to working 3 – 5 years in a school. our youth workers are there to serve the school, matching their gifting with needs in the school. this includes:-mentoring-leadership development -working with prefects, school leaders and school councils -working with small groups on life skills -sports coaching -assisting in classes, on trips and activities -being an extra pair of hands on camps -organizing fun events -training students the schools we have the pleasure of working in are:-hillmorton high school -cashmere high school -middleton grange school -christchurch south intermediate 








            about syc trust
          










we operate under ‘spreydon youth community trust’, with a heavy focus on young people in the communities of south west christchurch. we are a charitable trust set up in 1997 by a group of passionate, talented people who shared the mission of ‘helping young people become followers of jesus’. nearly 50% of our income is from grants from bodies such as christchurch city council, cogs, canterbury community trust, lotteries, lion foundation and others. this helps us pay for wages, transport, equipment, admin, overheads and supplement programme costs. we want to spend more time working with young people and less time fundraising, and you could help us do that. if you believe in the syc vision and would like to support us financially, you can make donations into our bank account: bnz 02 0800 0628410 00 or even set up a monthly direct debit. remember 1/3 of everything you give to charity can be claimed back at the end of the tax year! you can now even give through payroll with your employer. if you would like to support us by making a financial donation please get in touch.
