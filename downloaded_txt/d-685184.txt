happy valentine’s day!
february 5, 2025 qualitygardens










our greenhouse and retail store are open 10am – 5pm daily through the winter! it’s firmly indoor gardening season here in western pa, but we also carry bird feeding supplies & seed, decorative pottery, gifts, and of course plenty of houseplants. we are fully stocked with flowering indoor favorites just in time for valentine’s day like cyclamen, african violets, primrose, bromeliads, anthurium, and plenty of orchids! the colder months can be a challenging time for keeping indoor plants happy and healthy, so don’t hesitate to stop by with any concerns or questions! 
join us for winter events in our event space, including an orchid basics class and more incoming.
our shrubs, trees, and perennials have been tucked away for the winter season, but our knowledgeable nursery staff is still available to help you plan for spring. all of our trees and shrubs are well-suited to western pa landscapes. we offer delivery and install, as well as full landscape design services.
in 2025, our nursery guarantee is changing. to hopefully continue providing our customers with affordable plants for years to come, quality gardens will be adjusting our woody nursery guarantee on trees and shrubs going forward. the details are busy being ironed out, and we’ll keep you in the loop! guarantees offered during the 2024 growing season will not be affected by any upcoming changes and will continue to be honored.
