testimonials




getting a match puts a whole new perspective on what you’re doing. most people spend time volunteering to help others, but when you see a direct impact of your work, like a match being found for someone who doesn’t have any other chance at survival, it shows you just how much you are helping people. it shows why this is important, and why you must continue.
hannah steinberg
gift of life campus ambassador, university of south carolina



raising needed funds to support gift of life, and coordinating swabbing drives to find potential donors, has become my passion. by recruiting other volunteers, i have had the opportunity to encourage hundreds of caring people to engage the best parts of themselves in helping gift of life fulfill its life-saving mission.
gail oliver
gift of life volunteer since 1991



this is a good deed that anyone would do – anyone of good heart would donate bone marrow. i feel grateful for the opportunity and pray and hope my recipient has the best possible outcome.
aleksei k.
bone marrow donor



donating showed me that i can do more than i thought i was capable of. it’s an incredible feeling to think i’ve never met my recipient, but that we share so much in common.
rebekah h.
stem cell donor



as part of an ethnic minority [with jewish ancestry] my sample helps make the registry more representative, increasing equitability in our health care system.
matthew e.
stem cell donor



receiving the notification that we got a match was an extremely validating experience. it showed me that the effort we are putting in is really making an impact. i am excited to keep on swabbing and keep on finding matches!
noah streitfeld
gift of life campus ambassador, university of central florida



i think if more people knew that recipients relied on close genetic matches to receive a transplant, more people would join the registry.
adin d.
stem cell donor



how could i say no? i never had a second thought. i know someone at the other end is fighting to survive cancer and needs my help.
keaton p.
stem cell donor



i want to thank cbre because it’s very gratifying when you work with a company of 78,000 employees that they would drill down deep enough to care about one particular employee’s cause. but that isn’t why they did it, they really bought into how important this cause is.
stephen b. siegel
chairman of global brokerage, cbre



people think about it too much! go swab, see what happens, maybe you’ll find out you’re a match. go with the flow and don’t worry.  twenty minutes to donate bone marrow and you’re done – you’ve saved a life!
carl s.
bone marrow donor



it is rare for people of african ancestry  to find a match, and especially hard for people of mixed race. donating is a wonderful opportunity, this is more of a privilege than anything else. you just feel very good in about yourself that you are doing something to help somebody, so i encourage everyone to get on the registry.
ifunanya n.
stem cell donor



the mets are proud to be a longstanding corporate partner of 15 years with gift of life. when the donors and recipients meet [on the ball field] the space is immediately filled with gratitude, compassion and inspiration. we appreciate the work gift of life does every day and we look forward to creating many more memories together.
juliana sabra
manager of community engagement and external affairs, new york mets
