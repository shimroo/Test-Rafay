easy mistake to make, jeb
presidential candidate jeb bush commented on the decision not to indict the police officers who killed 12-year-old tamir rice yesterday, saying, "i think that chicago's got a lot of work to do to rebuild trust. the level of violence is abhorrent." when reminded that the rice case was in cleveland, he said, "i'm sorry, my bad."
