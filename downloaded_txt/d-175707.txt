upset recovery training






















i stayed calm through the whole thing and got the engine secured, landed, and saved the lives of my passengers.







knowing what to do and when to do it — that’s the value of simulator training.







what could have been a very difficult situation was not an issue at all.







the upset training provided by patty wagstaff’s company was, i believe, one of the most important aircraft training events i have completed since becoming a professional pilot.
