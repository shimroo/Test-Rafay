projects and areas of interest (more may be added in next
          few time intervals)
1) dynamics and control of soc systems
              (sandpiles, plasmas)
motivated by the complicated dynamics observed in
          simulations and experiments of gradient driven turbulent
          transport, a simple paradigmatic
            transport model based on the ideas of self organized
          criticality (soc) has been developed and investigated . in
          many cases a strong coupling exists between the turbulence and
          bulk flows in the system. if the bulk flows are uniform the
          turbulence imbedded in the flow is simply advected and the
          dynamics are usually not changed. often however, such flows
          are spatially dependent (sheared) and therefore can have an
          impact on the dynamics of the system. soc systems have been
          the focus of much investigation recently due to the broad
          relevance of many of the characteristics of these systems. for
          example, 1/f noise is a ubiquitous feature in many diverse
          physical systems from starlight flicker through river flows to
          stock market data. additionally many of these systems (and
          others) exhibit a remarkable spatial and temporal self-similar
          structure. the physical and dynamical self-similarity that is
          exhibited by these systems is very robust to perturbations and
          is not necessarily close to any "linearly marginal" state such
          as the angle of repose for a sandpile. it is this
          self-similarity and non linear self organization that leads to
          the term "self-organized criticality". in many systems
          (magnetically confined plasmas for example) the transport of
          constituents down their ambient gradient is thought to be
          dominated by turbulent transport. that is a turbulent
          relaxation of the gradient. the turbulence itself is often
          driven by the free-energy in the gradient . it is this
          combination of turbulent relaxation removing the source of
          free energy thereby turning off the turbulence which then
          allows the gradient to build back up which allows the
          development of robust (albeit fluctuating) profiles. the
          dynamics of such systems can be computationally investigated
          with a cellular automata model of a running sand pile. this
          model allows us to investigate the major dynamical scales and
          the effect of an applied sheared flow on these dominant
          scales. in addition to allowing the paradigmatic investigation
          of turbulent transport, the introduction of sheared flow
          (wind) and the determination of transport coefficients in
          sandpiles, both of which naturally arise in the context of
          magnetically confined plasmas, act as a novel and important
          extension to the chaotic dynamics of soc systems.

2) the dynamics of complex infrastucture
              systems (power transmission,
              communications, traffic, etc)

note (16 aug 2003): if you
                are interested in papers relating to the dynamics of blackouts like
                the 2003 blackout you might want to read the following
                papers
          blackout dynamics in power transmission systems (hicss2001 data analysis
            paper 1 , hicss2001
            modeling paper 1 , hicss2001

            modeling paper 2 , hicss2002

            modeling paper 1 , hicss2002

            modeling paper 2 )
          communications systems (
              hicss2002 modeling paper 1)


3) the interaction between sheared flows
              and turbulence
 
4) basic plasma
                and fluid turbulence

investigations of the basic dynamics of the turbulent
            systems can shed light on both interesting nonlinear
            dynamics and applications of these dynamics in relevent
            physical systems. 


5) modeling transitions in plasma
              transport
transitions to enhanced confinement regimes are very
          important for the success of the fusion
          energy program.
6) dynamics of atomistic flows in carbon
              nanotubes
in nature the interaction between fluid flows and
          surfaces and the resultant transport due to the flows is both
          ubiquitous and of fundamental importance. one of the flow
          regimes of particular interest is that in which the fluid
          transitions to a turbulent flow. in this case, the transport
          characteristics and flow dynamics change dramatically. in
          addition to an enormous amount of attention given to these
          systems, much progress has been made in recent years on
          modeling and understanding the dynamics of these continuous
          fluid flows (cfd) using the navier-stokes equations. however,
          with the ever-increasing interest in smaller size devices (for
          example, in microelectromechanicalsystems - mems applications)
          an interesting new regime is encountered. this is the regime
          in which the distance between surfaces becomes comparable to
          the atomic or molecular sizes of the flowing material. while
          the highly "viscous" flow through irregular microporous
          materials has been extensively studied the basic underlying
          physics of the "fluid" dynamics of flows through "smooth"
          regular structures on this scale have yet to be characterized.
          in particular, the demonstration and characterization of
          transitions in flows on these scales will have a profound
          impact on the development of the new blossoming capabilities
          in building micro and nano scale devices and structured
          materials.
          a relevant yet simple realization of such a flow is that
            given by atoms flowing through carbon nanotubes. typically,
            in nano scale systems, the effective viscosity is expected
            to be high unless, perhaps, the flow "channel" is very
            regular and smooth such as that found inside a carbon
            nanotube, for example. investigation of these "atomistic"
            flows is of interest for the obvious reason that one must
            understand how material flows in these nanotubes if one
            wishes to use them. more importantly the demonstration of
            new flow dynamics with transitions within the tube could
            lead to altogether new uses. in addition, basic
            understanding of flows on these scales may be of relevance
            in the extreme boundary layer of continuous (navier-stokes)
            flows and may help in the design of special coatings, for
            example, to decrease (or increase) drag. it should be
            stressed that the novel aspect of this is not simply the
            nanoscales in the system, but rather the interaction between
            the atomistic flow and the very regular surface created by
            the nanotubes etc. this research project, which is on the
            cutting edge of the burgeoning field of nanotechnology, can
            at the same time make fundamental contributions to the
            underlying basic physics.
