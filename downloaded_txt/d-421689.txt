						best service in charlotte! i had multiple custom orders that they made sure worked for my home. the result? a fabulous lighting solution for my outdoor needs. modern lighting has the best products from numerous vendors and provides the human touch needed to plan and execute customers’ projects.

						modern lighting is a breath of fresh air in today's complex building environment. they met all deliverables on time, helped with many last-minute rushes, and went above and beyond to ensure satisfaction with the configuration, style, and functionality. they have an expansive knowledge of products and are priced more competitively than other distributors. we will use them again.

						liza and her team are total professionals, and their service is second to none! she also provides a super valuable lighting consult service, something you can’t get from most designers or architects, that can really help the way your home feels and functions. even if pricing online were less, i’d buy products from liza every time, given the level of service, detail, and accessibility her team provides. i’m glad to have them as a partner in the business!
