new work: what to expect from me




what to expect (from me)
mixed media, oils, gesso, inda ink, old house numbers, glue, stamps, found objects.
18″ x 24″ x 1″
painted sides, ready to hang
i just needed, in the middle of a long commission that i am currently trying to finish, to paint for me. this is what came out. i guess i don’t want to behave yet. i don’t know if i ever will.  i guess that’s what you all should expect…
raw & radiant,
heather

new art- owl #1



 ‘owl #1′16″ x 20″oils on flat canvas panelavailable for purchase on my web site in the 2010 gallery.i just finished this painting this morning. i was dreaming about owls the other night, and i woke up needing to paint one for myself. i am still pushing through the abstract works, and i think this painting is a nice mix of loose and tight painting.  i love his eyes, i hope you all can see the depth of color in them. i am enjoying learning what he had to teach (i just feel this owl is a he).well, that’s all from me for right now, let me know what you think as i love to hear from you all.have a great day and thanks so much for being here today.heatherhttp://www.badkittyartstudio.comsupport living artists, buy some art today.

new art- 3 new works!



 'drowning pool'24" x 36" x 2"oils on thick gallery wrapped canvasready to hang, needs no frameavailable for purchase on my web site in the 2010 gallery.i am continuing to push forward on the abstract works. this is the largest one so far. lots of texture and color, i wish i had gotten a better picture of it. these colors are a little bit difficult to show online, with perfection. these were the best pictures in the 2 dozen or so that i took. my neighbors probably think i am crazy, because i was hauling this painting all over the front and back yards trying to get the best light. sheesh! lol they are used to my crazy artist antics by now, i’m sure…but i was wearing my pj’s, paint covered smock and fuzzy slippers while doing this, so now they know for sure that i am nuts and have no shame at all. oh well, it works for me.  'unification'16" x 20"oils on flat canvas panelwill need framing or stretching to hangavailable for purchase on my web site in the 2010 gallery. 'thick and thin'20" x 16"oils on flat canvas panelwill need framing or stretching to hangavailable for purchase on my web site in the 2010 gallery.i’ve been busy pushing myself in the studio. these are two of the three that i stared this weekend, the third is still on the easel, i’ll share it soon. i’m switching to un-stretched canvas for the time being, just for storage concerns. with the slow down in sales and shows over the last two years, i’ve got a storage problem in the studio. for the time being, i can paint all i want and store them easier in flat files. i can stretch them or frame them at a later date if i need/want to. the bonus to my patrons is that i can sell for less, and the shipping will be super cheap to any where! woot! fyi: bad! kitty studio always offers free shipping on every work to any where in the world. who loves ya? ;)anyway…i’ve just been playing around, letting go, having fun. it’s been liberating and fun i hope that shows in the works.let me know what you think about the new works,i just love hearing from you all.love to all,heatherhttp://www.badkittyartstudio.comsupport living artists, buy some art today.

new art- rocky mccocklespur



   ‘rocky mccocklespur’18″ x 24″oils on back stapled canvasfinished sides and comes ready to hang out of the box,needs no frameavailable for purchase on my bad! kitty web site in the 2010 painting galleryhere is the quote that helped to inspire the painting:one day the president and mrs. coolidge were visiting a government farm. soon after their arrival they were taken off on separate tours. when mrs. coolidge passed the chicken pens she paused to ask the man in charge if the rooster copulate more than once each day. “dozens of times, was the reply.” “please tell that to the president,” mrs. coolidge requested. when the president passed the pens and was told about the roosters, he asked “same hen every time?” “oh no, mr. president, a different one each time.” the president nodded slowly, then said, “tell that to mrs. coolidge.” calvin coolidge (1872 – 1933)rocky was a super fun painting to work on. i love painting birds of all kinds but hands down roosters are the most fun. they have so much attitude and the challenge is always to capture that in the paintings. i think i nailed it, he is full of attitude! he is the first of a new series i am going to be working on through 2010, i’m calling this year ‘the year of the creature’ at bad! kitty studio. i’ve got more birds in the line up and also horses, dogs, cats, cows, donkey’s and monkey’s too. that is by no means the whole list but enough to give you all an idea of what i’m heading for. last year i spent the year trying to master the human form and faces, i feel i’ve still got a lot to learn but have made enough progress to focus on something else for the challenge. i also want to work on learning to do good abstracts, that’s a lot more challenging than i first thought it would be. so, come along and join in the fun. send me suggestions for animals or pictures and try to really challenge me, i welcome the comments and participation from my readers and patrons alike.i hope you enjoy rocky, let me hear from you all, tell me what you think and offer suggestions for coming works.have a great day and thanks for being here today, i appreciate you all more than you can know.love to all,heatherp.s. don’t miss the last day of the current art auctions (scroll down one post for all the links) i am trying to make room in the studio as it’s getting a little too cramped in here, so i’ll be running weekly fine art auctions for the forseeable future. that’s great for my fans, as you can pick up some great art, at fantastic prices. as always, art sold from the web site comes with free shipping and insurance, worldwide and there is always the art-lay-a-way program too, for those on a budget.http://www.badkittyartstudio.comsupport living artists, buy investment quality art today!
