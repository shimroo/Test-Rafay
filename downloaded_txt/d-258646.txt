ivan krstic ‘04
cybersecurityivan krstic first became interested in cyber security in 1997 when he says he realized “that the simple question of ‘how do i delete my files safely’ had a tremendously complex answer.” krstic took that curiosity from cranbrook to harvard, where he would eventually take a leave to become a systems security and architecture specialist as the director of security architecture for the one laptop per child (olpc) program. it was his bitfrost security design for olpc that captured the attention of apple, where he is now the head of security engineering + architecture. read more.













cathy sybert olkin '84
aerospacein 2006, cranbrook kingswood graduate cathy olkin stood near the shoreline in cape canaveral, florida, and watched a spacecraft she helped design begin its ascent to pluto. it was an experience olkin doesn’t believe she would have been a part of if not for her early start at cranbrook. “at cranbrook, i was in an environment where i was able to reach more and learn more,” olkin says. “being curious was a safe thing to be. it was accepted.” olkin is a pioneer, not only by being part of the “new horizons” team sending the first spacecraft to pluto, but also by preparing to fly into space herself. read more.













natalie zemon davis '45
humanitiesnatalie zemon davis has always been captivated by the possibilities of social transformation. it began during her days at kingswood, when her studies in history, literature, current events and ethics began to shape her world view. "i feel i developed a social conscience at kingswood,” says davis, who has written nine books, including the popular “the return of martin guerre.” the importance of her work has been recognized by scholars around the world, and it has been said that she is one of today’s most creative historians, using her unique combination of imagination and painstaking research to tell the story of the human experience through the eyes of the ordinary person, not the elite. read more.
