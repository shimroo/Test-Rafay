                                    i just recently opened a small business during this pandemic, and wtc has done everything in their power to get me up an running. the very same day i inquired, we managed to get internet hooked up at my business location. an employee offered to head to my business on the way home to make sure everything was functioning correctly and to give me any and all information i needed!

                                    not a bad thing to say about this company! they are great to work with and you won’t see secret charges adding up on your bill. i’ve had them for 5 yrs now and i haven’t had any extra charges to my bill like i’ve had in the past with other companies.

                                    wtc is the best! they are friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. they care about their customers and respond immediately to calls for assistance, with issues big or small!
                                




candace s.




                                    very good communications company, especially with their internet service! never really had any problems with these people. certainly extremely helpful doing business with a local company rather than a megalith company based in new york.

                                    wtc has been by far the greatest company ever!!! their customer service is what i want to talk about. originally, i was with their competitor because i didn't see many reviews on wtc. however, i left that other company and joined the wtc family. i was treated with care, value, and respect...

                                    we've used wtc for a few years now and they offer the best prices, services, and customer service you will find. we've only ever had great interactions with their employees, from technicians in our home to customer service agents over the phone, they're amazing. highly recommend!
                                




gabby t.




                                    the customer service is unbeatable! i could not believe when my husband and i decided to upgrade our service it was after hours and i knew if i didn't call and leave a message i would forget by the next day. i left a message and received a call back and was upgraded immediately. i'm impressed with wtc and would not have service with anyone else. thanks wtc.

                                    we love having wtc as our business internet/phone provider as well as our home internet provider.  any time we have had issues they have sent someone out immediately to help and that is amazing customer service!!!!  plus they support so many events and things in our community.  proud to be a customer and proud to know so many of their amazing office staff and techs as they truly are our neighbors!

                                    our business recently switched from cox to wtc for our phone & internet and we couldn't be happier. customer service is very friendly, the techs are great, and their service works very well. can't recommend them enough!
