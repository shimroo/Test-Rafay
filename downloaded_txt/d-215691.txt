growing older
by agnes thurner ©2018

we start growing older the moment were bred. 
too soon we graduate, too quickly wed.
our work takes a toll and our joints give way,
before we know it, our hairs turning gray.

our children are growing before our eyes
and we have grandchildren, what a surprise!
now close to retirement, have we saved enough?
otherwise the going is sure to be tough.

now in our seventies and getting frail,
heart and lungs are beginning to fail;
great grandchildren are keeping us youthful.
im reverting to childhood if i must be truthful.

the kids are now taking care of us folks.
they do a good job and we dont have to coax.
they order our pills and pay for them too.
our lives now full circle, nothing left to do.

now were fed and diapered, in bed by eight.
showered and shaved, theyve checked our weight.
thought of writing my memoirs but clean forgot
what life was like fore my mind went to pot.


               untitled 
through the crimson deserts of time,
and life's half blink dawn bursting diamonds in the sky,
the raindrops are heaven's tears dripping over us all
like a warm blanket for the soul
washing us clean from every sin.
         [© 08 oct 1998 s.g. miller - george mcclure]

 merle haggard is carried home - on the wings of angels (even god is crying)
 c. george mcclure 06 ap 2016 

 
merle haggard was always the outsider. his band was aptly named the strangers. he passed today, on his 79'th birthday, after losing part of a lung in 2008 and fighting pneumonia for 11 months. 

"merle haggard is the best singer in country music." [george jones]

"merle haggard is a walking talking electric guitar-slinging woody guthrie." [george mcclure] 

somebody asked my mother, can you describe your son in a paragraph? she said, i can in one word: unpredictable. [merle haggard]

"you might even trick the devil once in a while, if nobody knows what youre gonna do." [merle haggard]
