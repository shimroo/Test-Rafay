guitars gear reviews tonymckenzie.com







where music, gear and reviews come together













  
  
  
 















































                
                welcome to tony mckenzie's website 
                
                













music, gear, reviews and more 
guitars, amps, amplifiers, effects, 
				fender, gibson, prs, ibanez, mesa boogie, marshall, egnater, 
				roland, splawn, ceriatone, kemper, divided by 13, diezel, 
				dumble, ground control, music, video, music shows, interviews, 
				accessories, music.gear.reviews 
				and lots of things for guitarists. it's not easy to find all 
				these musical products anywhere else together. 
there's even some guitar amp mods and 
				conversions of well known amplifiers including 110/120 volt to 230/240 volt mains conversions that some 
				makers don't want you to know how to make.
				  if you're fed up of reading reviews that don't quite tell the truth then this website 
				will be a refreshing change and is 
				for you. 
i have spent years personally buying musical equipment and 
				showing what it's really like with my 
				'inside and out' reviews that i actually invented back in 2009. these insights can save you from making 
				really bad mistakes that later you might well regret; 
				paid for or 'free gear' reviews in magazines and on the internet 
				in many cases could be and often are misleading; but here i 
				pay for everything just like you do, helping to tell it how it 
				really is from my point of view! 
some manufacturers wish this site 
				  did not exist! find out before you buy, be informed and make 
				  the right choices before you own it and it's 
				  too late.
there are also effects pedals, 
				  'how to' features such as making your own guitar, repairs and 
				  maintenance help and more. and my 
video section shows 
				  you how easy it is to fix your guitar or eliminate those 
				  sometimes annoying scratches; 
				  don't forget to check out videos of great players 
				  doing what they do best, playing live, captured with 
				  my video camera.
i would love to get a trustpilot review 
				  about this website! help me with a 5 star review. it will 
				  ultimately help you! here:

				  tony mckenzie's music gear unbiased reviews






 trusted guitar music gear reviews
some of the rarest modern day guitars close up's and in 
					depth reviews such as a gibson jimmy page les paul and a 
					dragon 2002 from paul reed smith. 






using mesa boogie amps

love them or hate them, these guitar amplifiers are 
					probably some of the best in the business. find out how 
					i get great tone and use them.






build your own guitar

i show you how to make a number of stratocaster style guitars 
					and some telecaster type guitars. i show different builds 
					and components on each build. warmoth, fender 
					and other parts.






latest news  
 updates show the latest info and are 
					usually consistent with lots of completed reviews and other 
					info; check here for the latest of everything.








tony's guitars and music
check out the guitars that i own or have owned with close 
					up's of many great guitars as well as music albums i have 
					released through big dan studios.






using marshall amps
a legend in their own right, marshall amplification is a 
					'must have' amplifier and here i show you some ways in which 
					i use them and get good tones.







guitar amplifier modifications
if you have a 110/120 volt amp and wish it was 230/240 
					volts then these 'how to' mods show you exactly how to convert a 
					few world class amps. other technical things too!






contact tony
if you have anything you want to ask then just use this 
					form to contact tony. info, say hello, problem, or most 
					other stuff. but please, no profanity!


find out about 
						musical equipment as you might well not have seen it shown before. i 
						don't sell anything and if i have examined it i have 
						typically bought it just like you. i dispose of much of 
						the gear later because it does not quite live up to 
						what some manufacturers say. i always say in the 
						conclusions all the good and not so good points and end 
						with a score.
















                
                  quick find sections
