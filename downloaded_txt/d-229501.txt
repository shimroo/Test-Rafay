introduction to hiphopslam.com
by billy jam
welcome to the hiphopslam website which is the collective efforts 
								of myself and such hard working muthaf**kas as geoff rantala and 
								dan kay from dawg eat dawg designz (all online graphics, layout, 
								designs, and twomp sacks), frank casiano ii (content provider 
								& editor), frank calistoga iii (chief supplier of mineral 
								water, energy drinks, & hashish), vladimir jam (my cool russian 
								cousin who worked long hours on our soviet sister site www.hiphopslam.narod.ru (rip), which he painstakingly translated into russian for the 
								swelling numbers of russian rap fans. word up v!
as with everything else we do at hip hop slam, this website is 
								totally independent with absolutely no outside financial or editorial 
								influence. hence the "don't give a f**k style website" 
								logo... although, truthfully, we do care and we don't curse much. 
								but we insist on the freedom to be able to curse. we hate censorshit! 
								which brings us to the unavoidable topical and tragic subject 
								of the events of september 11th. undoubtedly they will result, 
								to some degree, in the loss of many of our civil rights and liberties. 
								in the name of "defending america against terrorism" 
								we can expect to be subjected to all kinds of searches and privacy 
								infringements and, no doubt, censorship of any content deemed 
								"anti-american." but if history does repeat itself this 
								new world order will also spark a whole renaissance of revolutionary 
								underground art, including, of course, lots of great hip hop!
back to the website... it is pretty straight forward with several 
								different sections that, over time, will grow and expand in ways, 
								like adding video and sound clips. right now you can check out 
								information on all of the hip hop slam label 
								releases (25 in three years) in chronological order, or you 
								can check out the staff bios including 
								each person's hip hop top five lists. "the 
								gallery" is divided into a mix of pictures (new and old) and "flyers 
								& stickers" from past hip hop slam radio shows and 
								concerts. under "scratch attack" 
								you will find information about our monthly radio show with playlists 
								and charts, while "pirate fuckin' 
								radio" is a story/overview of the micro-broadcasting 
								movement. "articles" 
								includes stories and interviews by frank, myself, and yve-one, 
								who wrote both the invaluable "how 
								to manufacture your own cd, record or vhs" guide and 
								compiled the bay area dj list. 
								"links" is a list of some of 
								our recommended websites, while "hip 
								hop slam news" keeps you up to date on hhs related artists 
								and happenings. also, our shop is 
								now open for business... buy all hip 
								hop slam releases straight from the source!
we thank you for checking us out and we really hope you find 
								this website of some interest. we welcome your feedback... unless 
								you're some geeky little shithead hiding behind a tough alias, 
								in which case we have the technology to know where you live and 
								we will come to your house and beat you like the beyaaatch you 
								are. so watch it, chisel chest!
peace: billy jam
