    reviews from satisfied clients

★★★★★

    
  "the owners of front range roofing and siding and their crew were fantastic! professional. attention to detail. answered all my goofy questions and followed through. we now have a great roof! same with their gutter sub-contractor. they had to re-design the existing system, so now our gutters work!"


  

-nick g.



 
  “you can not beat the service and professional service of this company. since the hail storm damages all over the city of fountain and beyond i have heard of many roofing companies and a few that were there to just rip off the roof and replace so fast you never knew they were there. front range was very attentive friendly and thorough. great advice and concern for our predicament. they were individualized in their service to our house. job well done. the owner came to our house and walked us through the insurance maze. than you all very much.”


  

-jackie m



 
  dave and his crew were very professional and flexible. i needed a very fast turnaround on a small siding repair for a home sale. dave got the work done, at a fair price, in my very short time frame. the quality was great. kudos dave, i'll definitely do business with your team again!”


  

-gee n.



 
  "front range roofing replaced my roofing in a single day. they were very courteous and cleaned up when they were done. there were a few items that needed changed and they were back to correct the items the next day. i am very satisfied with the job."
