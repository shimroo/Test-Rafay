listen up!in 1970 klavier was founded in north hollywood, california by legendary record producer harold powell, a career sound engineer for nbc, because he believed many of the recorded classics on the market at that time were not the quality products they could and should be. powell therefore chose to dedicate himself to improving the sound quality of recorded music. klavier records was the result. because of his insistence on perfection, his recordings are frequently employed by manufacturers and dealers of audio equipment to demonstrate the qualities of their products. this year we celebrate the culmination of years of passion in capturing recorded sound in it’s most authentic form.
