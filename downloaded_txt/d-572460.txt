about fema national us&r response system
when a disaster event warrants national urban search and rescue (us&r) support, fema will deploy task forces. the role of these task forces is to support state and local emergency responders' efforts to locate victims and manage recovery operations.
canine  search teams play a critical role during structural collapse incidents. the canines help search teams to locate victims, using their incredible sense of smell to detect live human scent, even from a victim buried deep in the rubble.
each canine/handler team must pass rigorous national certification in urban search and rescue. and canine/handler teams must be re-certified  every three years in order to participate in search and rescue operations.

clicking on this map takes you to  fema's website, where you will find a list of all the fema task force teams' websites.  http://www.fema.gov/emergency/usr/locations.shtm
