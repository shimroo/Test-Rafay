guitar tablature is a form of music notation for the guitar. it’s way easier to read and far more accurate than standard musical notation that you would see for other instruments. guitar tabs consist of six horizontal lines that represent the guitar strings. numbers are placed on each line that represent the frets to play on those strings.
many classically trained musicians think that guitar tabs are inferior to standard music notation because tabs don’t express time signatures and many other musical elements. this might have been true a few decades ago, but modern tabs are divided into measures and add stems to each fret number to indicate timing. in this way, tabs are actually more accurate than traditional music notes.
here’s a full guide on how to read tabs.
