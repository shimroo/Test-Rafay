    release info
  















brhym is the new collaboration between bruce hornsby and the genre-leading american chamber ensemble, ymusic. following a five-concert tour in early 2020, bruce and the ensemble, comprised of alex sopp, flute; hideaki aomori, clarinets; cj camerieri, trumpet; rob moose, violin; nadia sirota, viola; and gabriel cabezas, cello, decided to keep the musical conversation going remotely during the pandemic and thus, brhym, was born. their debut album, deep sea vents, is out now.
