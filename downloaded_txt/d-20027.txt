alaska: modern living on the edge of wilderness













whatâs special about living in alaska?
                  perhaps nowhere else combines the conveniences of the modern age with the freedom and adventure of living on the edge of a vast, unspoiled wilderness as do anchorage and alaska. alaskaâs a young state. our major cities of anchorage, fairbanks, and juneau offer career and professional growth opportunities unlike many places in the lower 48. 
is alaska right for you? 
                    one way to find out is to  visit alaska! you'll find we're the friendliest people in america. while you're here, take time to see   denali park and kenai fjords, both near anchorage. you'll soon figure out why we think alaska is the last great place on earth. if you have extra time, check out our smaller communities like  homer,  nome, haines, ketchikan, or skagway.
what are the people like? 
                    weâre a tight-knit community with a taste for adventure and the good life. many of us like to fish and hunt. some of us seek a change of pace. no matter how we got here, our remoteness brings us together to solve problems in our own way. weâre proud of the saying, âwe donât care how they do it in the lower 48!â
