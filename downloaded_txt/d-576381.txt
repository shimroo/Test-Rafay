an informative look back on the austin area from eight years ago (and today things are even better!):
















"mary b" is amazing--friendly, professional, quick, super responsive, and generous with her time. i emailed her out of the blue (along with several other austin realtors) and asked if she'd be willing to run some comps to help me with my austin property tax protest. no other realtor (even the one who sold me my house!) even responded, yet mary b sent me numerous helpful documents (personalized to my case) that helped to convince the tax assessor to revise my assessment back to last year's value. she also patiently (and quickly) answered my follow-up questions and sent me additional documents in response. i would definitely recommend her to anyone buying or selling a house, and she will be the first person i call should i decide to sell my own home. in short, she's a winner!"
