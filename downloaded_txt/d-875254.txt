a bedtime story





all the doctors at st. helena’s hospital agreed there was little hope for fred as every organ in his body was shutting down after a lifetime of smoking, alcohol abuse and poor eating habits, the inside of his intestinal tract looked like a dirty, dank, and decaying subway system in some crumbling inner city, where blackened polyps hung in every corner lurking like tiny ticking terrorist time bombs waiting to explode into a burst of cancerous activity. however to tommy the tapeworm this was home.
