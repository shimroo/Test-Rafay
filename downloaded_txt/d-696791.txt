i really recommend volunteering programs! i’ve gained so much from taking part in different programs and it gave me a new perspective on what i can give to people as a part of my life here on our beautiful planet.
tjan daimon
long-term volunteer from slovenia




this experience has been a before and after in my life, because it made me more aware of the things i consume and the suffering that animals have to go through for this. obviously, i became a vegetarian after my participation in this workcamp. of course, an experience that i would repeat a thousand times over.
ericka
workcamp volunteer from peru in "the animal academy"






my volunteering experience has enriched me with practical skills and also allowed me to grow immeasurably on the inside – an experience i would never want to change and i am more and more grateful for.
nikola
long-term volunteer from czech republic
