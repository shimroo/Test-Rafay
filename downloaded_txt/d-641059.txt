 pediatric eye care 
 with so much going on in your child’s life it can be difficult to keep up, but it’s important to make sure they can see the world in front of them as clearly as possible. children should have their first eye exam around the age of six months. if the first exam shows their eyes are healthy, follow up with another appointment between the ages of 2 and 3 years.

 dry eye management 
 dry eye may sound like a relatively trivial issue — but if you currently suffer from this syndrome, you know just how troubling it can be. chronically dry eyes are not just uncomfortable; they can also interfere with your vision and eventually even cause serious eye damage.

 glaucoma management 
 glaucoma occurs from damage to the eye’s optic nerve and can often lead to loss of vision and blindness. to detect glaucoma, our highly trained doctors will perform proper screening to determine severity, examine damage, and help you manage your glaucoma.
