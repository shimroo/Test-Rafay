heartsong ain't misbehavin ~ sapphire sapphire is our dream dog. she has a very soft fleece coat, beautiful boning, and has perfect conformation. sapphire looks deep into my eyes when i talk to her as though she is processing my words (and i truly believe that she is). sapphire has her akc star puppy certification. she is gentle beyond words. when she runs, it is perfection. her favorite thing to do is to run in the woods. her second favorite thing to do is lay real close while i read or watch tv. sapphire is apricot in color and weighs 50 pounds. she comes from my foundation line out tegan park flame/heartsong ruby (our 4th generation out of tegan park). our beautiful pearl is her mother. this line is very precious to me and i think she is perfection. this is sapphire's third and final litter.
        

tuscan ridge rocco cappuccino ~ cappy cappy is 20 inches tall, weighs 47 pounds. teresa describes cappy as "darkest red you'll ever see."  she says, "he is the life of the party when there are lots of dogs around! he is playful, loveable, and fantastic with kids.... he takes a  lot of kisses and hugs with toddlers." cappy is very red, has great boning, ultra soft beyond words and is definitely therapy material. thank you teresa for sharing your gorgeous boy with heartsong.

sierra vista lil miss firecracker at heartsong ~ sparky sparky is owned and loved by agnes and brandon. she is a huge hit everywhere she goes! and she goes everywhere! agnes even takes her to mass. sparky is one of those dogs that makes eye contact with great intensity and i expect her to start talking at any moment. her structure is perfect. she has nice boning, good movement, perfect conformation. she loves everyone, especially agnes and brandon. she lived with me for two years so i am her second mom.  she has the softest, most beautiful single wool coat. this coat helps her offspring to continue to be low to non shedding. she is incredibly smart and could easily be a therapy dog.
