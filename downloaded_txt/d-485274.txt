slideshow2024 spring flingit's all about the ride!(and just a little bit about the food) our club promotes safe riding while exploring the wonders of the western united states and enjoying the camaraderie of fellow members. we feature many events throughout the year and a monthly newsletter to keep our members up to date with new club information and member submissions. folks come from across the country to join us for fun in california, so why not you? we hope to see you at one of next events!


about us
