what else can i do here?

x

most importantly, if you are a former tchs student, please register. we want to help find all alumni, renew old friendships and bury old hatchets.
sign in when you visit. while members are signed in, additional features are available. for example:

build a personal profile with a bit of history and a photo.
link to your website, photos at flickr, videos at youtube...
look up other members and send them private messages.
comment on articles, and post updates on your profile that will echo on the members page.
choose what you will share with others (e.g., your birthday, marital status...).
advertise your business to our readership at low cost. free directory listing to subscribers.

help us succeed!

become a class coordinator. inform classmates about special events, monitor forums, message classmates, facilitate reunions, and more.
keep your contact information up to date. don't change your email without informing us; we'd hate to lose you. (your contact data are confidential.)
tell us about reunions, link to organizers, reservations and planning tools, and report the outcomes. (some reunion stories are more exciting than others; the editors especially like the ones they cannot print.)
advise us of misplaced and deceased members.
write stories about yourself, tc, tchs and the community for tchs alumni news.
support our efforts financially.
