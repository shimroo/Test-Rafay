obama vs romney?  what's the difference?





actually about two to three feet!

on the one hand is the left-middle finger; while on the other is the right-middle finger! thus our people are caught between the two.

book review: the rose conspiracy; craig parshall, harvest house, 2009





"please don't let this case get to the death-penalty phase. do that for me, will you?"antagonist to her protagonist attorneyi evaluate books on the basis of our worldviews; clearly we select our reading material on that basis. the following are ten worldview factors considered relevant to an objective review of the rose conspiracy:moral offense/personal factor: very lowagenda/worldview factor: high/religiousreadability factor: highinterest/attention factor: high - slow to start but ultimately highfog/confusion factor: lowhistorical factor (if applicable): strongeducational factor (if applicable): medium to strongnovelty factor: highfinish factor: mediumoverall rating: on a scale of one to ten - an eight point five; if you're not a history fan, or you're an anti-religion zealot, you may not see it my way ... but, then, i don't really care!see below for the key to these factors.overviewaccording to harvest house, the publisher ... parshall takes his readers to the nation’s capital, where a hitherto unknown [john wilkes booth] document has turned up...and turned into murder.as the smithsonian’s president examines a newly discovered account of abraham lincoln’s assassination, an intruder steals in, kills him, and disappears into the night with the document.vinnie archmont, an accomplished and stunningly beautiful artist, is implicated. she hires the brilliant but secretly guilt–burdened criminal law professor j.d. blackstone.blackstone finds himself uncovering the mystic freemasons’ most guarded secret. he reluctantly turns to his uncle, a bible–quoting anglican priest and occult–religions expert. enemies like a sorcery–obsessed billionaire english lord, a powerful u.s. senator, and a ruthless prosecutor force blackstone to employ all his cunning.in the process, he is compelled to choose between [the] spiritual counterfeit and [what is presented as] gospel truth, [between] guilt and forgiveness ... [as well as between] destruction and a new beginning.parenthetical inserts are the crib's clarifications.overall i enjoyed the read; though not as engrossing as i prefer, it was a pleasant read and not a waste of time as so many are after you've read a couple thousand books in your lifetime; by that i mean the author overcame my overread prejudices.those prejudices tended to make the characters and plot somewhat predictable and, in many ways, poorly developed. however, after finishing the book and looking back, i see this criticism as relatively undeserved.the intent of the author and the publisher was to present a judeo-christian worldview in the context of an historical setting. did they accomplish that? i would answer that with a qualified yes. simply put "i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ" and so i would have preferred a frontal assault on the subject.by chapter 46 a subtle judeo-christian witness picks up and becomes quite well conceived and presented.at at least one point (about ch. 28) the reading slowed to a crawl and at another point (about ch. 37) i began to feel like there were too many cliches being thrown in ... however, in both cases the distraction brief.as a big fan of historical fiction, i would have enjoyed a greater development of the lincoln assassination and the plethora of civil war connections. but on the whole the work did not suffer from their absence.i would recommend this book to any reader; especially those who enjoy criminal or historical fiction, specifically those with a judeo-christian worldview.authorcraig parshall is senior vice president and general counsel of the national religious broadcasters association, and the author of six legal–suspense novels: the five books in the chambers of justice series, and the stand–alone trial by ordeal. he speaks nationally on legal and christian worldview issues and is a magazine columnist. he has coauthored five books with his wife, janet, including the historical novels crown of fire and captives and kings.disclaimeri am not an employee of harvest house publishers, nor am i associated with them or the author; additionally, i've received no compensation for this review; the book was provided to me at no cost for the purpose of review by active christian media.factor key moral offense/personal: did the author include material i found personally or morally offensive?agenda/worldview: did the author use his work to push an agenda or personal worldview?readability: how did the text flow; did i have to stop and go back? a little or lots?interest/attention: was i grabbed early on and held there to the end?fog/confusion: did the author write more than needed? was his style or plot line confusing? did i feel uncertain about where the author was going at any time?historical: since i read lots of historical stuff, were there a lots of historical goodies for me to munch on as i read? (note: full coarse meals earn "very high" ratings)educational: did i learn anything i did not already know or had forgotten?novelty: did the author present novel approaches in his plot and people?finish: did the author leave me hanging? did i feel cheated after sacrificing my valuable time to read his stupid book? in other words, did he finish his effort in a valiant way?overall rating: the author's final grade; a one is an "f", a five is a "c", and a ten is an "a."fav the crib! --  rss the crib! google the crib! -- stumble the crib!

bush 43: a very good man!





jeff emanuel has put a post up as a follow-on to a washington times piece on the positive side of the bush-cheney legacy.whatever problems and disagreements we all may have with president bush (and i have more than my share, starting with '04-'06 iraq, '07 israel, '07-'08 north korea and iran, tarp, immigration, nclb, the auto bailout, and many, many more), there's one fact which all who are not blinded by the most irrational form of bush derangement syndrome can agree on: a very good man is leaving the white house in just under a month. i've my problems with the man too, but bottom-line i'd love to call him friend.fav the crib! --  rss the crib! google the crib! -- stumble the crib!

science / tech: ephemeral links by their common ancestry!





the crib's periodically fugacious concerning the scientific & technological ...i'm fascinated by old (even deceased) publications ... this is great ...google has added a magazine rack to its internet search engine. as part of its quest to corral more content published on paper, google inc. has made digital copies of more than 1 million articles from magazines that hit the newsstands decades ago.for now, the old magazine articles can be found only through google's search service for finding digital copies of books. but the mountain view, calif.-based company plans to eventually include magazine articles in its general search results.users who want to restrict the scope of their inquiries to magazines can choose that option through the book search's "advanced" function.

sanctity of life: right to life declared in 1776!





while "tweeting" on twitter this am (shame on us we skipped church) i was urged to click over to red state and read ...the declaration of independence, in which our rights as americans and humans were so eloquently advanced, stated that all humans are created equal and endowed by their creator with unalienable (intrinsic, non-severable) rights. it does not state that humans are born equal, but created so. for this reason it matters when human life is created. for the answer we turn to science.ask any geneticist when life begins and (assuming sexual reproduction) they’ll tell you it’s when the ovum is fertilized by the sperm. at that point the fertilized egg has the same genetic structure it will have for its entire life, and much of the course of its future life is set, unless interrupted by accident or violent attack. life begins when the genetic structure is in place and the biological processes begin. it’s the same with a human as it is with a kangaroo or an amoeba. life, human or otherwise, begins at the beginning. that is the instant of creation. the act of creation invoked in the declaration is found at the beginning of life. [red state - lj miller]i would highly recommend my readers do what i did and read this fine piece. lot's of comments over there.one thought we must grasp from this: from a pro-life and constitutional perspective one must see the dna of a, impregnated with the dna of b, combining to create the dna of c; c's dna didn't exist till the genetic combination of dna from donors a and b.c's dna does not equal a's dna or b's dna (unless a and b are identical twins), it is unique.since human life is schematically represented by its dna (something it mysteriously acquires at or immediately following impregnation; the egg losing its donor's uniqueness, and the sperm losing its donor's uniqueness), life as we define human life must by default begin at or immediately a following impregnation.it boggles my mind that so many fail to see the simplicity of this: to abort a fetus is to end a human life and, also by default, violates that american's right to equal protection.i don't claim to have all the answers but you don't have to be a genius or a phd to see this.fav the crib! --  rss the crib! google the crib! -- stumble the crib!

book review: america's secular challenge - herbert london





as  the effects of and depression from mistake '08 begin to wear off, my mind swirls with questions, issues, imperatives, responsibilities, and choices.often i imagine i must write a book on all of this, especially radical islam, but the jumble of thoughts won't coalesce: hard and soft jihad, terrorism, taxes, america's socialistic drift, family, finances, deeply held spiritual concerns, children and grandchildren, collapse of traditionally democratic europe, aids, political malfeasance, sanctity of human life, absence of godliness, voter ignorance, biblical ignorance, and public ignorance ... to name a few.but my main concern has been the continuing rise of secular humanism - a menacing cultural, geopolitical, and philosophical hydra - among our people, and its debilitating affect upon our will to defend ourselves.well, herbert london (bio below) has had the same concerns and written a 97 page book which expresses them better than i ever could have.from the hudson institute web site (crib's emphasis):in this timely and wide-ranging book ... london argues that the pervasive culture of secularism in the united states is an inadequate response to the challenge of radical islam. as london explains, in the so-called war of ideas, our reflexive belief in relativism has handicapped our ability to thwart the inroads of fanaticism.taken together, traditional religion, multiculturalism and cultural relativism, materialism, and the belief in scientific rationality as the ultimate arbiter of human value underwrite a view of life that is ill-equipped to meet the challenge of a zealous enemy with totalitarian ambitions. in undermining the traditional roots of america, secular humanism has destroyed the west’s only beliefs worth defending.this anemic remodeling of our culture has left us exposed in the monumental battle against ideological forces with radical global ambitions. america’s secular challenge is a sobering wake-up call and a battle plan for the political and existential trials of the twenty-first century. author's bio:herbert i. london is president of the hudson institute, a world renown think-tank in washington dc.  he is professor emeritus and the former john m. olin professor of humanities at new york university.  and he was responsible for creating the gallatin school of individualized study in 1972 and was its dean until 1992.  this school was organized to promote the study of "great books" and classic texts.[...]in 1989, dr. london was one of the republican candidates for mayor of new york city.  in 1990 he was the conservative party candidate for governor of new york garnering more votes than any third party candidate in the state's history. ....order your copy of this must read book here. look, it's only 97 pages, who can't read 97 pages of really readable counsel. and for $18.00, the content cost less than 20 cents per page. and if you are a believer in american traditionalism and exceptionalism you would be wise to read america's secular challenge.i actually made copious notes to prepare for this review but have decided the above is sufficient to the purpose here. if you have questions, leave a comment or email me.fav the crib! --  rss the crib! google the crib! -- stumble the crib!
