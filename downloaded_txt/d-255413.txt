care for victims. safe journeys.






why we're here



we're here to support people bereaved and seriously injured by road crashes.



we're here to help people be community champions for safe and healthy mobility.



we’re here to campaign for safe streets and the rights of road victims.








our vision is a world with zero road death and injury, where we can all move in a safe and healthy way, whoever we are and however we travel.

until our vision becomes a reality, we are working to stop crashes on our roads, reduce harm when a crash
happens, and help every road victim get the support they need, for as long as they need it.
