portal login“[kerberrose hr] is a top-notch operation top to bottom. the tools and methodology their consultants use are extremely helpful. yes, they make you do your homework, but only because that allows them to help even more. furthermore, their common-sense approach and accessible staff make it easy to communicate and get help during what can be a tough time for a candidate. it was wonderful to work with a team that has so much knowledge of the job market and so much history with what does and does not work in a job search.”
