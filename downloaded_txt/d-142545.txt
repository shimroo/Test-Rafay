a picture of a white house so eager to make the case for war already begun in their hearts that they would stop at nothing. no lies, no coverups no abuse of power too great to stop them from the invasion which would consume the truth and ensnare some of the most powerful people in the administration.

washington, oct 25 (reuters) 1pm edtpresident george w. bush today nominated former fema director michael d. brown to be a new federal reserve chairman, replacing retiring chairman alan greenspan. chairman alan greenspan's 18-year tenure at the reserve runs out on jan. 31."i think it's important to bring somebody from outside the system, the federal reserve system, somebody that hasn't been at the bank and, therefore, there's not a lot of opinions for people to look at." said president bush. "brownie did a heckuva job on hurricane katrina and whats more is that he is looking for a job at the perfect time.mike brown defeated three other potential candidates regularly mentioned for the fed chairman job: glenn hubbard, a past adviser to bush; harvard economist martin feldstein; and fed governor-turned white house adviser ben "barney" bernanke.

war profiteer halliburton profiting from katrina hurricane disaster, much like the ghoulish profit from the disaster in iraq. bush buddy brown gets pulled off katrina (for total criminal ineptitude) but other bush buddies continue to reap the benefits of the administration's pathetic folly. impeach bush!

following in the footsteps of the new york times and boing boing, the editorial policy board of dickcheneyisabitch have concluded their process for selecting a candidate to endorse for the presidency of the united states. it is with great seriousness that we take this endeavor, for we in our long history have never endorsed a democrat for the office before. it is, however, our duty to recognize that despite the possibility that, yes, john kerry could well be a bitch also, that in fact the long record documented here in this blog suggests incontrovertable evidence that george w bush, and yes, even dick cheney--are bitches. therefore we hereby endorse john kerry for president in the 2004 elections.

dick cheney is a lying bitch mr. cheney, who has a history of criticizing officials who disclose sensitive information, typically refuses to comment when asked about secret intelligence. yet on this day, with a gallup poll showing that 58 percent of americans did not believe president bush had done enough to explain why the united states should act against iraq, mr. cheney spoke openly about one of the closest held secrets regarding iraq. not only did mr. cheney draw attention to the tubes; he did so with a certitude that could not be found in even the c.i.a.'s assessments. on "meet the press," mr. cheney said he knew "for sure" and "in fact" and "with absolute certainty" that mr. hussein was buying equipment to build a nuclear weapon. "he has reconstituted his nuclear program," mr. cheney said flatly.

rollingstone.com: "cheney's record of mistakes begins in 1959, when tom stroock, a republican politician-businessman in casper, wyoming, got cheney, then a senior at natrona county high school, a scholarship to yale. 'dick was the all-american boy, in the top ten percent of his class,' stroock says. 'he seemed a natural.' but instead of triumphing, cheney failed. 'he spent his time partying with guys who loved football but weren't varsity quality,' recalls stephen billings, an episcopalian minister who roomed with him during cheney's freshman (and only full) year at yale. 'his idea was, you didn't need to master the material,' says his other roommate, jacob plotkin. 'he passed one psych course without attending class or studying, and he was proud of that. but there are some things you can't bluff, and dick reached a point where you couldn't recover.'"

george bush is a bully. lets face it. america is nervous and insecure after 9/11--especially with scary figures like osama being dangled in front of us. it's a pretty typical gangster style "protection" racket.   america is scared, so it hangs out with the bully. but it's not worth it, america. the reputation of the bully on the playground is just getting worse and worse. by beating up and scaring other kids, he maintains an atmosphere of control. but the bully has no friends. eventually the other kids will find a way to get back at the bully.  by publically abusing those who oppose him, he makes everyone scared to oppose him. when he wants to tear someone down who is above reproach, he uses his cronies to do his dirty work. grow up america. we are in a scary time, but it doesnt mean we have to hang out with the bully. we can be a strong nation on our own. we can fight our own battles, we dont need a bully. dick makes fun of kerry for wanting more "sensitivity" (even though bush used the same language). it's not sensitivity towards our enemies, it's sensitivity towards our allies, friends and potential allies. how much hate has bush created? a hell of a lot. a bully may make you feel safe, but he's not your friend. he will abuse you when it helps him to maintain his power.

capitol hill blue: cheney faces criminal indictments; other illegal actions raise warning flags at white house london lawyer jeffrey tesler, a consultant to halliburton, admitted under oath in may that he made payments from the fund to albert “jack” stanley, president of halliburton subsidiary kellogg, brown & root and a longtime friend and associate of cheney.  the payments, tesler said, were personally approved by cheney, who headed halliburton at the time. although cheney left his position at halliburton before becoming vice president, his financial disclosure statements show he continues to receive dividends from stock as well as deferred compensation from the company. at least $5 million in payments to stanley from the fund were wired to a secret numbered bank account in zurich which judge ruymbeke discovered belonged to the kbr president. tesler also testified he paid another $350,000 to another kbr executive, william chaudran, through another secret bank account on the isle of jersey.

lesson #8 be prepared to reexamine your reasoning: what makes us omniscient? have we a record of omniscience?? we are the strongest nation in the world today. i do not believe we should ever apply that economic, political or military power unilaterally. if we had followed that rule, in vietnam, we wouldn't have been there. none of our allies supported us!?  not japan, not germany, not britain or france. if we can't persuade nations with comparable values of the merit of our cause, we'd better reexamine our reasoning.  robert mcnamara, former secretary of defense during the vietnam war, as quoted in the movie fog of war

the new york times > washington > bush asked for vatican's help on political issues, report says this is a fascinating case. i wonder if the church which is currently in a poor position because of priestly abuse of children is in cahoots with bush on his agenda? it's a bit harsh to equate prisoner abuse with child sexual abuse, but it's all about the abuse of power. the overly harsh part is to juxtapose these elements as there are a lot of good things that the catholic church does, and a lot of good things the us government does. but what the hell, this site isnt called "dick cheney isn't a nice man".

george tenet, you are out of there. the highly embattled cia director resigns. i suppose it takes some heat off of bush, but it's a good sign. bob woodward attributed him as saying that the iraqi evidence for wmd was a "slam dunk" and so he is clearly leaving in a cloud of blame even though sources say he is resigning "for personal reasons". most high level executives who are fired leave to "spend more time with the family". george herbert walker bush left the cia directorship to become president. george tenet is leaving the cia directorship on behalf of the president, and hopefully george w bush will be leaving the presidency because of the cia director. all of this is simply a distraction as far as dick cheney is concerned--he's the real power behind the throne.

"they're f------g taking all the money back from you guys?" complains an enron employee on the tapes. "all the money you guys stole from those poor grandmothers in california?"  "yeah, grandma millie, man"  "yeah, now she wants her f------g money back for all the power you've charged right up, jammed right up her a------ for f------g $250 a megawatt hour."  and the tapes appear to link top enron officials ken lay and jeffrey skilling to schemes that fueled the crisis.  "government affairs has to prove how valuable it is to ken lay and jeff skilling," says one trader.  "ok."  "do you know when you started over-scheduling load and making buckets of money on that?  before the 2000 election, enron employees pondered the possibilities of a bush win.  "it'd be great. i'd love to see ken lay secretary of energy," says one enron worker.  that didn't happen, but they were sure president bush would fight any limits on sky-high energy prices.  "when this election comes bush will f------g whack this s--t, man. he won't play this price-cap b------t."  crude, but true.  "we will not take any action that makes california's problems worse and that's why i oppose price caps," said mr. bush on may 29, 2001.  both the justice department and enron tried to prevent the release of these tapes

george w bush is a post turtle while suturing a cut on the hand of a 75-year old texas rancher (whose hand was caught in a gate while working cattle), the doctor and the old man struck up a conversation about george w. bush being in the white house. the old texan said,"well, ya know, bush is a 'post turtle'." not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a 'post turtle' was. the old rancher said, "when you're driving down a country road an you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a post turtle." theold man saw a puzzled look on the doctor's face, so he continued to explain, "you know he didn't get there by himself, he doesn't belongthere, he doesn't know what to do while he's up there, and you just want to help the dumb bastard get down!"

i can't believe we are not talking impeachment here. we should impeach bush if what's in woodward's book is true. the book alleges  700 million dollars diverted to tommy franks' secret war plans without congressional approval, and a secret deal with the saudis to lower gas prices in the us for the november election this is incredible and most decidedly impeachable. what a horrifying abuse of power, if true.

`either he is straightforward and states who they are, or the only conclusion one can draw is that he is making it up to attack the president,'' said white house spokesman scott mcclellan, referring to kerry's claim that "more leaders want to see him elected as president over bush.  it's actually a bizarre comment coming from mcclellan. why is it that the "only conclusion one can draw" is that kerry is "making it up"? that seems like an odd concept, could he possibly be that stupid? one could easily draw many conclusions including that any world leader who was "outed" by kerry as being opposed to bush would suffer horrific reprisals and generally be an embarassment in the international community. i mean, you think these things, maybe even say them to your friends over a beer. but diplomatically, you just can't publically piss off a sitting president.  our man dick actually made more sense by saying ``senator kerry said, `that's none of your business,' but it is our business when a candidate for president claims the political endorsement of foreign leaders,'' cheney said. ``at the very least, we have a right to know what he is saying to them that makes them so supportive of his candidacy.'' boston herald has the story here.  i would suspect that dick cheney's understanding of the role of secrecy and power give him a better understanding of why some world leader wouldnt be willing to step forward and say "yeah it was me".

des moines, ia– former lieutenant john kerry was reunited today with his long lost twin brother, lumiere from disney's beauty and the beast.  kerry and lumiere have not seen each other since 1969, that was the year lumiere was turned into an enchanted candlestick.  lumiere, now a retired actor living in anaheim, california, flew to iowa this morning to meet with kerry.  kerry campaign spokesperson stephanie cutter issued the following statement: "john and lumiere kerry were delighted to be reunited after so many years. the family resemblance is striking, even considering that lumiere still has not recovered from being turned into a candle."

not specifically about dick cheney but about his war. the u.s. central command acknowledged firing on a vehicle near the central city of najaf after its driver ignored orders to stop and a warning shot.  "as a last resort the soldiers fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle. inside the vehicle they found 13 women and children. seven of the occupants were dead. two were wounded. four were unharmed," a spokesman said.  ------------------------------------------------ contrast that is this report: "it was the most horrible thing i've ever seen, and i hope i never see it again," sgt. mario manzano, 26, an army medic later told the post. manzano said one of the women sat in the van holding the mangled bodies of two of her children. "she didn't want to get out of the car," he told the newspaper.  presumably this woman was one of the people this spokesman referred to as "unharmed"

great, halliburton was on the brink of bankrupcy but saved by lots of shenanigans. this link's text sounds like a bunch of neo maoist revolutionary claptrap, but there are a wealth of interesting links on the bottom of the page about war profiteering by dick cheney, your friend and mine.

in thinking about the movie "lord of the rings: the two towers", it seems that bhagdad is like helms deep where the massed armies are accumulating. or could it be that the world trade center was the two towers. who is evil? who is good?

we regret the use of hate language on this web site. after all, when directed at anyone other than dick cheney, we consider it to be inappropriate and offensive.

lets take a brief pause to reflect on the definition of bitch. clearly dick cheney is not a female dog--the term is intended to convey a rap cultural aesthetic on the topic of his contemptibility.
