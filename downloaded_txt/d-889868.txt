attention to details















quality matters to well dressed windows!our draperies and valances are lined with high quality 100% cotton lining in a cream color that doesn’t look like a white sheet from outside. and then we used tiny cording or piping called micro cording to finish the edges of valances and many other items to give them dressmaker detailing.
