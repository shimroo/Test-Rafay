welcome to gold country endurance riders!
meeting information
become a member!
gcer is a 501(c)(3) organization (ein 68-0002043).
gold country endurance riders (gcer) was started back in 1980 by a handful of friends who had the desire to preserve and improve the sport of endurance riding as well as the many beautiful trails they all enjoyed, scattered throughout the majestic sierra mountains.
today we remain active for many of the same reasons. we are a non-profit group and through our members, volunteers and proceeds we help to continue the endurance riding sport and maintain the local trails and parks. the annual gold country endurance ride is our main fundraising event and is one of the oldest endurance rides.
we also enjoy group horse camping, hosting clinics, meeting new folks at our events and finding new training partners to ride with for any of the many endurance rides found throughout year. new riders and seasoned riders of all disciplines are welcome!
whatever the reason you’ve ventured on to our site today, gcer invites you to join us to see where the trail takes you!
announcements

stay tuned!
