your original farmers marketspringfield, missouri



we are the springfield area’s only true farmers’ market. that means that the person selling produce to you personally planted, grew, harvested or made your food. our vendors are not allowed to buy food for resale like other markets allow. you can look your farmers in the eyes and ask them about the source of your food. this matters to us, and we know it matters to you too. meet your farmers and vendors. because the journey from our farms to your table is always less than 100 miles, you enjoy naturally ripened and better tasting produce, and a longer shelf life.
