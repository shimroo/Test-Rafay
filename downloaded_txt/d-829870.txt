james 5:13-15 new king james version13 is anyone among you suffering? let him pray. is anyone cheerful? let him sing psalms. 14 is anyone among you sick? let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the lord. 15 and the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the lord will raise him up. and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.      in 1971 jean and i attended a catholic charismatic conferene at notre dame in south bend, in. i attended a workshop on "praying in faith". the speaker said that as he looked at his faith, he found he didn't have the faith to pray for world peace, but he did have the faith to pray for peace in his neighborhood and in his family. he then said he had a mentally retarded son. as he looked at his faith, he realized he didn't have the faith to pray that his retardation would be taken away. but he found he did have the faith to pray that his son would learn to tie his shoes; and he learned to tie his shoes. he then said that piece by piece of his son's retardation were being healed as he prayed at the level of his faith.     lord jesus, help me pray at the level of my faith.a word received: pray in faith and see what i will do. albany intercessor
