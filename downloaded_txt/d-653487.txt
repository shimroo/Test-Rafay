                    now available: a new book detailing hurstwic's research on viking combat. men of terror, a comprehensive analysis of viking combat (westholme 2021) is a richly illustrated interdisciplinary study of the heart of viking society: weapons and combat and is based on more than two decades of research at hurstwic. the book takes its title from a runestone raised 1000 years ago in denmark in memory of a man named fraði, who is called the "first among vikings" and a "terror of men." the authors present a holistic picture of fraã°i's society  from what has previously been only disparate and intriguing parts. order it now from your favorite book seller.

hurstwic research



                                hurstwic has developed a unique, science-based approach to researching viking-related topics, which will be the subject of a future web article and is outlined in a lecture now on-line that we gave at the national museum of iceland. in our research, we have encountered many traps and pitfalls in the field of viking research.an example is our research into viking-age iron smelting, a project that culminated in an iron-making festival at eirã­ksstaã°ur in iceland, and a special exhibit on viking-age iron-making featuring our research at the national museum of iceland that ran through 2024.
