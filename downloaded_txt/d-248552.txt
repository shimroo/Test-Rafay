  micahel m.   12/12/2024   have used them for years. easy to work with and andre/karla team are friendly and very efficient. gentlemen in the warehouse are always friendly, work efficiently as a team and are a lot of fun.   emily s.   11/6/2024   our experience with apres was excellent - andrea helped us bring our vision to life with beautiful chairs, linens, glasses, and silverware! everything was seamless and professional!   grace b   10/24/2024   we love apres event decor and tent rental! they're pro's and their selection can't be beat. we worked with katiee and emily and both of them were so patient and thoughtful as we sifted through linens in the beginning stages of the process. their expertise helped make our wedding day the most magical day ever. i could literally hear our guests saying "can you believe how soft these napkins are?!"

never underestimate the power of a beautiful linen! they elevated our event so beautifully and i'm so grateful to the apres team for helping us make it happen!   rachel m.   8/13/2024   fantastic experience with apres! katiee and emily were great and responsive to my many questions. they even visited our site before the party to recommend the ideal layout. and the set-up / take-down was seamless. i was so impressed with the set-up folks - it was raining hard outside, and they still continued to set up in the rain.

we look forward to working with apres again!   mikaela k.   8/9/2024   we got our dance floor, linens, tables and chairs from apres for our wedding! everything was perfect - from ordering to their delivery/pick-up team, everything was seamless. we are so grateful and their rental items looked so good!   marcus j.   8/5/2024   for our outdoor wedding, we used apres for a tent, cafe lights, dance floor, and some linens. everything we received was high quality and worked well. we had no issues with our delivery and set up of the tent. everything went great and made our outdoor venue come to life.   marie m.   8/1/2024   i had a wonderful experience working with the apres team. they have a great variety of items to choose from, so i was able to rent changers and glassware from the same spot.

the team was extremely responsive and great to work with. they accommodated our scheduled and multiple changes to our order. i would work with them again and again.   margaret l.   7/25/2024   dear andrea,

i am grateful we decided to go with you and your company, apres.  i never imagined the effort it would take to construct and then deconstruct that huge tent.  it was like a miracle, transforming our yard into a real wedding event.  thank you for your guidance and leadership.  i wanted you to know that the workers were respectful, efficient, and so kind to us as we fumbled through the expectations. it was our first time having this huge of an event, and the team helped us through it.  what a smart idea to add the lights.  the centerpieces included floating candles that sparkled along with the lighting of the tent, and we could view the lush green of our outdoors from the tent.  beautiful, beautiful!
at the very end of the event, we experienced a downpour.  we were thankful that we had the tent so all of us could shelter and wait out the rain.  it did not feel crowded at all and kept us all dry.

on behalf of the bride and groom, thank you to you and your team.

sincerely, mother of the bride
