come and worship.

give back to god.



giving is an act of gratitude to god for his many blessings. we ask you prayerfully consider support of st. francis and our ministries through a contribution.as stewards*  of god’s creation, we strive to give back to god, not to earn his favor or grace, but as a sign of our gratitude, and our desire to build the kingdom  according to his will.* stewardship is a theological belief that humans are responsible for the world, humanity, and the gifts and resources that have been entrusted to us.
