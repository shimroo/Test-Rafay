port everglades
1850 eller drive
fort lauderdale, florida 33316
phone: (954) 371-7678



greater fort lauderdale’s port everglades, magnet for gleaming cruises ships and comfortable passenger terminals, touts big logistical advantages. fort lauderdale / hollywood international airport is just across u.s. 1 / federal highway from the cruise port, making it possible for passengers to practically step from plane to ship. literally, the typical airport / seaport link takes less than 10 minutes. nearby southport shopping center makes it easy to pick up last-minute items before sailing. port everglades boasts the deepest harbor in florida, and one of the nation’s shortest, straightest entrance channels for quick ocean access. the 1.2-nautical-mile distance between sea buoy and main turning basin is navigable in a half-hour, a key reason more than 5,400 ships call at port everglades annually, bolstering a "world's premier cruise port" reputation.


despite status as a tourism juggernaut, early settlers first envisioned port everglades for shipping farm produce. port development efforts centered on a shallow lake separated from the ocean by a sand ridge. in 1911, the same year of fort lauderdale’s official incorporation, the florida board of trade pushed for a deepwater port for shipping north and west while a florida east coast railway (fec) survey showed lake mabel as prime for a rail / harbor operation to enhance trade with cuba.


by the 1920s, hollywood was coming into existence and fort lauderdale had 3,000 residents among broward countys populace of 30,000. area movers and shakers including hollywoods joseph young believed a deep harbor with ready ocean access guaranteed prosperity. in 1925, young began harbor development, at one point importing 35 lumberjacks from vermont to clear mangrove jungle. with the nation in economic crisis by the following year, young -- by then hollywood mayor -- sought harbor bond referenda support from hollywood and fort lauderdale. each city overwhelmingly approved sale of $2 million in improvement bonds, with jubilant backers parading by torch light to young’s home. the 1926 hurricane, killing 243 people and causing major damage ($1.5 billion in today’s dollars), slowed progress. but in 1927, state legislators officially established the deep water bay mabel harbor. on feb. 22, 1928, with schools and businesses closed, nearly all of broward gathered for a harbor dedication. in what was promoted as 
the "wedding of the waters," president calvin coolidge was to press a button at the white house detonating explosives to remove a rock barrier. but nothing happened when (and if) he pressed the button. the barrier was then otherwise removed, and by close of 1928, some $100,000 of cotton products had passed through the port to cuba, deeper into the caribbean and latin america. fort lauderdale’s first airport was dedicated in 1929, just as the port project was officially deemed "completed."


in the 1920s, flour, feed, fertilizer, sugar, and produce were the commodities of promise, and in 1930, several women’s clubs ran a contest to choose "port everglades" to represent the gateway to the rich agricultural area embraced in the four million acres at the port’s very back door."


few, if anyone, could foresee tourism allure, much less the then non-existent leisure cruise industry. on dec. 21, 2003, port everglades set a world record, hosting nearly 45,000 passengers  enough to fill 300 boeing 737s. the same day, the port also hosted a record 15 cruise ships in a single day, valued at a combined total of nearly $3.5 billion.


sailings from port everglades now run the gamut from world cruises and extended transatlantic / transcanal adventures to traditional seven-night caribbean vacations, day-trips to the bahamas and six-hour cruises to nowhere. increasingly, port everglades cruise passengers opt for pre- or post-cruise extensions to enhance ocean-going holidays with land-based fun.
