nestled along the beach at jamaica bay, kennedy's serves up a variety of fresh seafood and dry aged chops, not to mention a stunning view of the manhattan skyline — the perfect spot to gather with family and friends.

 




 


“the views of the sunset are breathtaking and the food was top notch. i’m going to keep coming back as this place was a hidden gem.”

— john s. (yelp)




“our food was delicious, the service was great, the views are amazing, and they also had live music. i enjoyed this from the beginning to the end. highly recommend and easy to understand why they are number one.”

— lexy (tripadvisor)




“this is a fantastic family dinner spot. it’s in a beautiful location and has large windows that look out toward the water. we went at sunset and it was stunning to watch the sky glow and the lights illuminate in manhattan and coney island.”

— sarah m. (yelp)




“delicious restaurant, great view and great service. stopped in for dinner while in breezy point and had a delicious meal!”
