dare to be different.
since the legend of tige was born, we have remained consistent to our core values and our independent culture. today, we're still the dreamers, the doers, the makers, and we break the rules to give you a vastly superior experience. we live for shattering your expectations of what a boat can be.
if we could laminate passion, we would. instead, we use fiberglass.
