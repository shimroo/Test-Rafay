aerosmith's steven tyler makes triumphant return to the stage at grammy awards watch party

as the grammy awards were underway just across town last night at crypto.com arena, aerosmith singer steven tyler gathered a collection of gutsy rock hitmakers for his 6th annual jam for janie event and live auction at los angeles' hollywood palladium. joan jett, billy idol, marcus king, linda perry and more joined the rhythm section of former guns â€˜n roses drummer matt sorum and megadeth's james lomenzo on more than a dozen hits - their own and several zeppelin tunes. 

the rumor mill suggested there would be a proper aerosmith reunion - notable, considering the group retired from touring following tyler's vocal injury in august. and while that didn't necessarily come to pass, tyler did grace the stage with original bassist tom hamilton for aerosmith classics including "walk this way" and "sweet emotion," with fellow bostonian nuno bettencourt handling guitar duties for an absent joe perry (including the talk box on the latter tune). perry's presence was indeed felt, though he delivered a message via video and donated a guitar to the auction. 

hamilton and tyler wrote the grammy-winning song "janie's got a gun," which inspired the decade-old janie's fund charitable initiative to help young women aging out of foster care. the tune wasn't performed, but tyler did stage a triumphant return to the mic. after 54 years of touring, his vocals sounded in fine fettle, as noted by bettencourt as the extreme guitarist launched into his band's acoustic hit "more than words" with tyler on vocals and mick fleetwood on percussion. tyler's voice was matched by his always charismatic rock star persona, his onstage energy and vibe as powerful as it was during the band's several heydays, leaving many to wonder if the vocal retirement might not be permanent. 

tyler's first full-band song was the rollicking "toys in the attic," and afterwards, he gestured to the balcony to thank the fireman and first responders in attendance. while the janie's fund charitable initiative celebrates its tenth year in 2025, it pivoted to honor and raise funds for those affected by southern california's historic and horrifying wildfires. 

one of aerosmith's most-loved power ballads, "dream on," started with an assist from singer lainey wilson taking a cool country approach alongside tyler on piano and vocals. but it ultimately devolved into a version of the iconic original that could have benefitted from a bit more rehearsal. however, it's a treat to see tyler, 76, braving it beautifully without the sonic comforts and control of a place like vegas' park theatre, where aerosmith began a concert residency in 2019. 

while some speculated that the evening would be a bona fide aerosmith reunion, it was more piecemeal - drummer joey kramer hasn't been with the band since 2020, and guitarist brad whitford has always been a lower-key member than perry and tyler. and jelly roll, a promised marquee name listed in the program, was a no-show, but the night was with its surprises as the black crowes' chris robinson made a cameo. 

"something's going on, it's a switch," said tyler, before bringing up the vocalist. robinson has a loose-limbed belter vibe not dissimilar to that of tyler, and it made sense that the crowes were openers on the aerosmith's final, aborted "peace out" tour. the frontmen proved they remain two of rock's most engagingly authentic and powerful performers on "sweet emotion," "walk this way" and the final song, zeppelin's "whole lotta love." 

linda perry set the rock-and-roll tone for the evening with a pair of impassioned (if slightly sloppy) zeppelin gems including "rock and roll." marcus king raged on guitar and vocals for creedence coldwater revival's "proud mary" before billy idol, joined by longtime guitar compatriot steve stevens, turned in a pair of hits "rebel yell" and "dancing with myself." joan jett was likewise in top form, alongside producer/band member since 1979 kenny laguna and punky nyc guitarist dougie needles. if the runaways' "cherry bomb" was maybe lost on some of the younger audience members, it was the ideal choice for the storied sunset boulevard venue, down the street from jett's early runaways days at the whisky and troubadour.
