welcome to barkley regional airport















for over 70 years, barkley regional airport has helped connect the purchase region with the world. in june of 2023, we began a new chapter with the opening of a state-of-the-art terminal that gives paducah and our region something they can be proud of and can serve as a warm welcome to our guests. we truly hope this new terminal, can serve as the “front porch of the purchase region.”
our aim is to provide affordable, friendly, convenient air service to our region. whether its power in every seat, a pet relief area, local art or affordable parking, our amenities make you feel at home, even when you’re not. let us show you why there is no need to fly from another city, when everything you need for a great travel experience is right here in your own backyard!
