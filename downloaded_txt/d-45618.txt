# python 3: fibonacci series up to n
>>> def fib(n):
>>>     a, b = 0, 1
>>>     while a < n:
>>>         print(a, end=' ')
>>>         a, b = b, a+b
>>>     print()
>>> fib(1000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
functions defined
the core of extensible programming is defining functions. python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. more about defining functions in python 3


# python 3: list comprehensions
>>> fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'lime']
>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
>>> print(loud_fruits)
['banana', 'apple', 'lime']

# list and the enumerate function
>>> list(enumerate(fruits))
[(0, 'banana'), (1, 'apple'), (2, 'lime')]
compound data types
lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that python understands. lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. more about lists in python 3


# python 3: simple arithmetic
>>> 1 / 2
0.5
>>> 2 ** 3
8
>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division
5
intuitive interpretation
calculations are simple with python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work as expected; parentheses () can be used for grouping. more about simple math functions in python 3.


# for loop on a list
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> product = 1
>>> for number in numbers:
...    product = product * number
... 
>>> print('the product is:', product)
the product is: 384
all the flow you’d expect
python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — if, for, while and range — with some of its own twists, of course. more control flow tools in python 3


# simple output (with unicode)
>>> print("hello, i'm python!")
hello, i'm python!
# input, assignment
>>> name = input('what is your name?\n')
what is your name?
python
>>> print(f'hi, {name}.')
hi, python.

to simplify the adoption of fhe, which involves a complex and resource-intensive technological stack, zama developed tools that streamline the integration of fhe into applications. since python is the de facto standard for building machine learning (ml) applications, it was an obvious choice to create an open-source fhe library in python.
