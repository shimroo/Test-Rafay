鞏俐走光





鞏俐（1965年12月31日－）生於遼寧省瀋陽市，山東濟南人，中國女電影演員。1985年考入中央戲劇學院表演系，畢業後留校任話劇研究所演員。1988年，她與首次執導的張藝謀合作，在影片《紅高粱》中扮演女主角九兒。隨著《紅高粱》的一炮打響，鞏俐也被海內外廣為關注。此後的兩年間，鞏俐又主演了兩部張藝謀執導的影片《菊豆》和《大紅燈籠高高掛》，都飾演了中國社會深受壓迫的女性形象。鞏俐在其早期作品中都是與張藝謀合作，主要扮演質朴堅強的農村婦女角色。到了90年代中期，隨著與張藝謀的分手，她也開始轉換套路，開始飾演舊時代的城市女性和古代人物。例如《畫魂》，《霸王別姬》，《漂亮媽媽》、《周漁的火車》等等。張藝謀與鞏俐在事業和感情上都曾是親密無間的伴侶。《紅高粱》，《菊豆》，《大紅燈籠高高掛》，《秋菊打官司》，《活著》一系列影片使這對導演和演員達到了兩人事業的巔峰。然而在交往8年，合作7部電影之後，兩人最終還是選擇分手。鞏俐隨後與經商的黃和祥結婚。近年傳聞與男演員孫紅雷有感情上的發展。近來與張重新合作演出《滿城盡帶黃金甲》，但最近幾年主要在美國發展。

keep your baby safe product recalls





every parent's top concern for their baby is to keep her safe and healthy. hundreds of baby products are recalled each year because they pose a danger to your baby. keeping abreast of these product recalls is very important to keep your baby safe. here are some tips to help you stay informed when it comes to your baby's safety.first of all, when you purchase a new product for your baby, always send in the warranty and product information card that comes along with it. while this may seem like a time consuming and useless task, it is essential to make sure you get the information you need if a product is recalled. if you fill out this card and the product is indeed recalled, you will be contacted by the manufacturer with the recall information. additionally, if a refund or replacement part is provided for the recall, you will get the chance to receive it. if you do not fill out this information card, there is no way for the manufacturer to know that you own their product.the next step in making sure you stay current with baby product recalls is to check periodically for recall notices to see if anything you own has been recalled. you can check baby product manufacturer websites, or even news websites and search for product recalls. this can be fairly time consuming, however. an easier way to find up-to-date recall information is to visit a baby supply store. baby stores such as babies r us post current product recall information, along with the necessary information needed to obtain the replacement parts, if applicable. sometimes repairing a hazardous product is as simple as removing a portion of it. these recall notices will tell you exactly what needs to be done and you can easily find all of the most recent recall notices all in one place.
