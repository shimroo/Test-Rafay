overclocked: being the misadventures of two guys 

                that are into emulation, gaming, remixing videogame music, reviewing 

                bad games, and questioning the very meaning of existence . . . 

                with goofy hair.

11/12/2001 

                      - hell freezes over
i have always been reluctant to end things, and 

                      thus overclocked has stagnated for awhile without updates. 

                      i have used this time to work primarily on overclocked remix, 

                      which will remain my focus, but i still think there are 

                      things that need to be said, topics which haven't been covered, 

                      and much more importantly stupidity and inane nonsense still 

                      locked inside my mind that should be liberated. i'd also 

                      like to transform this site a bit, because even if no more 

                      strips get made, preserving what's here has its benefits. 

                      you can actually track some important events in emulation 

                      history. and some totally unimportant ones as well :) we're 

                      not dead, here, people - just slumbering. so enjoy the latest 

                      strip, expect updates sometime in the future (but don't 

                      hold your breath as it'll still be at a slow pace), and 

                      thanks for reading.
