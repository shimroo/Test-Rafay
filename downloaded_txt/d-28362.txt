duluth entertainment convention center
we are the premiere destination convention center directly on the water of lake superior.
with our ten venues, the decc is the place to:
hold a conference or toast your family and friends on a special day,
rock out to live music in our arena or intimate auditorium, and
cheer your team from curling to dance to hockey to robotics.
with sweeping views of lake superior, 25 meeting rooms, two ballrooms, two hockey arenas and an emphasis on sustainable practices, plan your next big occasion at the decc.
