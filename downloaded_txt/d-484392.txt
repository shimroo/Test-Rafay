bfm acknowledges that the depot market is on the ancestral homelands of the coast salish peoples, who have lived in the salish sea basin, throughout the san juan islands and the north cascades watershed, from time immemorial. we express our respect and gratitude for our indigenous neighbors, the lummi nation and nooksack tribe, for their care and protection of our shared lands and waterways.
