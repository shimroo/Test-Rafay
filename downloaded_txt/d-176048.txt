about theyachtmarket ®
since its inception in 2003, co-founders of theyachtmarket richard w. roberts and simon white had one core mission in mind - to offer the very best online experience when buying and selling a boat.
it is this core mission that has driven theyachtmarket to its preeminent position in the industry today, offering the most comprehensive and technologically advanced resource whether buying or selling, for all types of boats, from sailing dinghies and tenders to powerboats and commercial vessels.
as market innovators, richard and simon continually develop and enhance theyachtmarket, welcoming feedback directly from its members – yacht brokers, private sellers and boat buyers – to ensure it remains the resource of choice and the most cost-effective solution to generate quality sales enquiries. 
the past 15 years has also seen theyachtmarket founders transform the industry to ensure it remains transparent for everyone. in 2007, richard and simon were amongst the founding members of the open marine initiative which created a free and open standard for boat data exchange. the philosophy of being trusted and transparent is extremely important to the business and it has been a game-changer for the industry.
