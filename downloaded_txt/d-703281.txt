why do you need otla at your next event?

a little belated, but my boyfriend and i had a portrait done over the weekend at arts and crafts in anacortes. i was a bit hesitant to have it done, because the last caricatures done of us wasn't really what we had hoped. but we conversed a bit with teague and felt like we'd try again, and holy moly, were we happy with the outcome! we wanted to do some batman villain themed work, and he really delivered (even put some comic references in there i didn't catch until we'd left - the laughing fish). it's framed and displayed in our living room. what a great artist! thanks for making me more confident about caricature art!!
