                                        great job with communication. 
the delivered bouquet was not as nice as the pictured bouquet. 

----
florist's response:

we understand that sometimes the flowers don't look like the pictures. we get flowers in daily, therefore, they are still in bud form, they require time to open and bloom. mother nature also plays a big part in the flowers, since we can not control everything, we do our best to inform the customer by enclosing a note and care instructions.
we appreciate you taking the time to leave a review, much appreciated.
