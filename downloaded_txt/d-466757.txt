   how should we engage students on the matter of generative ai and learning in our courses? examples from yee, uttich, main & giltner’s ai hacks for educators will be shared, with an opportunity to practice with different generative ai tools. session four will demonstrate ways to prompt genai to generate charts, graphs, and infographics. this session is suitable for participants with minimal experience using generative ai but will be most useful if you know how to access microsoft copilot through your uconn microsoft 365 login.  detection of ai use will not be the focus of these sessions, but we may discuss ai-resistant activities and assignments. you are encouraged to contribute your questions, ideas, and experiences.  register - https://fins.uconn.edu/secure_inst/workshops/workshop_view.php?ser=3346
