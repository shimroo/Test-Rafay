your guide to natural healing



a gateway to wellness
altmedangel.com is dedicated to holistic research and the science behind hard-to-find natural treatments for difficult conditions.
youâll find this archive chock full of very hard-to-find research on holistic approaches to healing collected over many years, long before i became a certified natural health professional (cnhp) and before much of this information was censored.  that is why google cannot spider the passworded section of this site.  itâs literally for your eye only and itâs my pleasure to share with you these natural cures that work.
since starting this portal in 2000, i have since increased my credentials, adding digestive health specialist and energy healer.  as i was undertaking these many years of training, i finally understood why it is impossible for the average person to heal themselves without professional guidance.  the public information you find online is only part of the story.  you find lots of puzzle pieces but you must connect them yourself.  without a medical background, thatâs very hard to do since censorship plays a big role in what you are and are not allowed to see.  so iâve shared some of that background here and on healthsecretssummit.com in hopes of giving you a better understanding of how to connect the dots.
it's my firm belief that, in this day and age, it is imperative to be aware of the effects of politics on your health and happiness.  there is no ignoring, escaping or hiding from it.  itâs invasive, pervasive, and due to government jab mandates, may now possibly have altered your blood chemistry.  --  angel

why am i sick?













the age of information
is one of the greatest gifts known to man. thanks to the internet, people can access 
		        		research on all kinds of health conditions. in doing so, they are becoming increasingly aware of the ulterior motives and political maneuverings surrounding our regulatory agencies. laws have been put into effect, without majority consensus, to make dispensing information about alternative medicine a crime. so what don't they want you to know?
the usa is one of the only countries in the world that allows large corporations to experiment with the food supply, without adequate testing. the same companies that sell altered foods here have removed offending ingredients in products sold internationally. it is because of this i offer the following public access information as an introduction to my classified research.

why doctors don't recommend natural alternatives
doctors have lost hospital privileges because they recommended 
									vitamins or discussed alternative therapies in solving chronic disease.
hundreds of natural health products have been confiscated 
									and removed from the market "pending drug approval" not because they were 
									dangerous but because they worked so well they must be re-classified as 
									drugs. with one stroke of a pen, legislation is born that puts hundreds 
									out of business and significantly restricts your right to know about 
									natural cures that work.


so how do you cope with the myriad of "holistic" information where profit 
									is king, advertising revenues control the press, and regulators turn a blind 
									eye to the twisted data supporting drug claims? sifting through all the 
									conflicting natural health & wellness information on your own can be difficult, 
									if not impossible; and relating what you find to your own situation without 
									professional help can be downright dangerous.

the wellness connection
the wellness connection is a research and referral source for patients wanting to find solutions for difficult health issues. if you are researching a particular problem, you may want to get some feedback from the wellness connection.
angel prefers to work with difficult cases. she feels that health care practioners are working under legal restrictions that prevent them from revealing life-saving options.
most know more about how their car works than their own body. as a retired teacher, angel takes the time to explain how the body works and can help decipher the language it uses to communicate what it needs. -- the wellness connecion is free for privileged users of this site.
