weston photography four generations of photographic excellence















growing up weston: in the presence of women is a magnus opus of the photographic medium, a guidebook to the lives of the weston family going back four generations……..
kim weston’s book





kim weston’s print of the monthwhen edward weston started the print of the month club in the 1930’s, he did so because he believed that "photography is a poor man's art and anyone who wants to own a print should be able to." for over two decades, gina and kim weston have followed in edward's footsteps, producing 25 print of the month portfolios that have included some of kim's most well-recognized work.
