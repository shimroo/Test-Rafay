what is sexual assault?
anytime someone is forced, coerced and/or manipulated into any unwanted or illegal sexual activity, it is a sexual assault. sexual assault or abuse are terms we use in our work to talk about the broad spectrum of unwanted or illegal behaviors. the term sexual assault, used throughout our site, is generally used in reference to adults. when it involves a child or teen who has been victimized, we frequently use the term child sexual abuse.
