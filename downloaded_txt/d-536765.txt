look beneath the surface and you’ll see all that cmc offers — strength. integrity. dependability. 
that’s not just a description of our products, but also our people. sure, you’ll find cmc construction solutions at the heart of much of our modern infrastructure — from at&t stadium in dallas to the pentagon to essential highways, bridges and buildings all over the world.
but at cmc, we also work hard to build something far more important — lasting relationships.
the kind of partnerships that keep our customers returning to us time and again for their most important and challenging projects. such loyalty doesn’t happen by chance or convenience. it’s the result of the passion of our people. at cmc, we care about the products we make, the folks we make them for, and the world we all share — now and for generations to come.

see what's inside






cmc steel serves as the backbone for an incredible array of highways, structures and other projects. it’s just not always obvious. that’s why we’ve created this easy way for you to look inside and see the strength and versatility of cmc steel for yourself.













































































































profiles in steel






                            sure, cmc steel is renowned for its strength, dependability and innovative qualities. but the same can be said of our people. like the products they create, these folks have a way of exceeding the highest expectations. probably because they refuse to deliver anything less than the best.

"when things get tough, we circle the wagons to get things done. it’s all about working with good people who want to do well. you can have the best equipment, but it’s really the operators and the people who make great products… and happy customers!

we think on our toes and work hard. we have fun, but safety always comes first. seeing everyone come together and pushing hard to reach our goals is energizing!

i’m forever thankful to the recruiter who met me as a new physics grad, saw potential in me, and introduced me to my mentor. it put me on a career path i love."

cmc feels like family, and the thought of working anywhere else doesn’t appeal to me!"

“the thing i’m most proud of is our focus on safety. every day that everyone goes home, and no one was hurt, is a successful day for me. safety really matters to everyone here, from the big guys on down. i like seeing the team working hard and being safe.
 
“when i started at cmc 25 years ago, we had a great environment and it’s only gotten better. we still have challenges, but the good kind, like how to make our customers happier and how to do more for them. every year, the company grows, but at the same time it finds ways to care more and more about the people working here. and, not just about the employees, but our families as well.”

making it happen

“i joined cmc after graduating from technical high school, which allowed me to gain knowledge for my future profession as an electrician so that i could start working immediately after i graduated. the salary i earn right after technical school is good as well as the benefits. the work atmosphere has been friendly ever since i started, everyone helps each other as much as possible. i appreciate that cmc allows time for my interests outside of work – it’s a good work-life balance."

making it happen

“we are a family, like brothers and sisters, and we have each other’s back. there’s such a sense of pride working here. we make the steel that goes into the buildings, roads, and bridges around us. it’s rewarding to see our work make a direct impact in our own community.
 
as a civil engineer, coming to a big company like cmc was a big move towards growing my career. being an estimator, i’m the first step in fabricating rebar for our customers so i get to know about all the projects even before they happen. my goal is to become the lead estimator for my team and have us be the best at what we do. i love it here.”

1939

                                                    1939 is my biggest abstract piece yet. i wanted to experiment with different styles. it is composed of abstract plates with striations that resemble topography. these plates are meant to be bolted down and let it blow in the wind.

                                                    i chose the subject "trumpet flower" to portray what is usually seen as quiet and peaceful, and instead replace it with something that's loud and makes its presence known.

                                                    my piece represents a honey bee collecting honey from a flower. the reason i made this was to show people the beauty of them, without getting scared of a bee. it combines the beauty of nature with the cold and shiny metal.

rat dragon

                                                    rat dragon (ragon) is my interpretation of what i think a rat and a dragon would look like together. made from found nails, washers and screws that i bent into place. i chose to make a dragon for an assignment, but when i started to piece it together, i thought the tail looked like a rat tail, so i just kept going.
