women’s recovery association


women’s recovery association provides a comprehensive continuum of care including residential treatment programs, professional clinical services, and community peer support.
restoring lives…one woman at a time.
wra began in 1964 as a support group for alcoholic women started by sister anna marie towers. the organization was incorporated in 1970 and opened its first residential treatment program in 1973, in san mateo. women’s recovery association joined the healthright 360 family of programs in 2014.
wra’s individualized and integrated clinical services are designed to address the complexity of women’s needs. the clinical program is the core of every treatment plan for women in the residential program.
our comprehensive programming includes individual and family counseling, group therapy, and educational groups that focus on women’s recovery from substance use disorder and related addictive behaviors, such as eating disorders and nicotine dependence. in addition, wra provides specialized services that address:

co-occurring mental health disorders
recovery from trauma and abuse
emotion management and relapse prevention
health and wellness
relationships and building community
increasing self-esteem and self-efficacy
issues specific to young women, ages 18-24
