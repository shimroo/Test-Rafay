what people are saying about a&r interiors…










fantastic. winston was awesome to work with. he created a design that is exactly what we wanted. he was prompt and prepared for appointments, was always friendly and helpful, and made sure we were happy. highly recommend a&r!

winston has done an amazing job in making my sad little foyer and living room into something beautiful. he has great ideas and also really listens. the whole staff has been a pleasure to work with.

met with allyson to do an interview. what a warm person she is and it is evident in her design style, not to mention fabulous furniture and accessories in the store. stop by, you'll love what you see!

a&r did such a fabulous job of decorating my lake house that it was featured in a magazine! i have now asked for help with the new house that i am building. they have demonstrated excellent knowledge of decisions required when building a house, siding, patios, cabinetry, fixtures, moldings, stains, paint, etc. they are now guiding my husband and myself through combining 'his' and 'hers' household furniture of very different styles -not an easy job! i don't know how we would do all this without a&r.

great staff. wonderful reception when we talked in. displays are beautiful they couldn’t have been more helpful. the showroom is beautiful. they have it all from furniture to all sorts of wall covering.

very friendly and talented designs at a&r . place looks great, very happy with it...

i am usually skeptical about going to design houses and using a decorator. most of them just want you to buy their furnishings and do not seem to really care about one's own style. i met with allyson last week; after trying to search on my own for paint colors for a restoration project i had just about given up. i brought just a few samples of the tile and furnishings i had already purchased. within a half hour she had picked 3 super colors that were in a line bm paints that i was not even aware of. i took them to my project today and the colors were even better that i could have imagined. so thanks so much for your help.

i continue to have an excellent experience with a&r interiors! not only is their design service outstanding, but their furniture is exquisite. they have a wonderful mix of elegant furnishings, coupled with personalized service. the designers have an innate ability to create a functional but beautiful space, taking into consideration the taste of each customer. i have gotten countless compliments on my home thanks to the efforts of a&r.
– dean and heather b. –






over the past few years we have been frequent customers of a&r interiors. we enjoy going to the showroom as there is always something new and unique to see, and of good value. we have been very happy with our purchases and their design services. we look forward to working with a&r again.
– terri and bob –






lori & lori - i just wanted to say a big thank you for everything.  the room looks just perfect to me - it's amazing how happy it makes me feel to finally have everything look right. again, thank you for everything!

the daunting task of redecorating our home was made so much easier when i began working with a&r interiors. our home is 10 years old and has simply been a series of off-white, neutral colored rooms until a&r managed to bring it to life. we really appreciate their designers talents and have thanked them many times for putting them to work for us. we would highly recommend a&r to anyone looking to create a unique, comfortable, functional living style in their home.
