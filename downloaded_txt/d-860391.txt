life on the chesapeake
bay according to a tangier island waterman, "it is not an easy way of life.
in fact, it is a true labor of love. 
commercial fishing and crabbing
for the chesapeake bay blue crab is physical and demanding, but it is the
love for the chesapeake bay, its wildlife, and its beauty that makes it
worth all the aches and pains we live with each day".
rain or
shine, tangier island awaits you! 
a great time,
anytime............
for the young
and the young at heart........
