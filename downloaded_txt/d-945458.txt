the adults only getaway

we cater exclusively to adults, young adults 16+ and pets, offering beautifully
            appointed rooms with the extras one expects from a first class establishment.
pet friendly

pets are welcome at the wisteria inn. bring your four-legged loved ones on
            vacation with you for way less than it would cost to board them.
poolside mimosas

enjoy mimosas by the pool at noon everyday while staying with us, weather
            permitting. it's just another way we like to pamper our guests.




boutique inn style

the wisteria inn is a cozy, adults-only hotel nestled just steps
            from the cerulean waters and sugar-white sand of northwest florida's panama city beach.
swim, soak, or sun

enjoy a dip in the pool, a relaxing soak in the hot-tub, or lounging by
            either. all this within the tropical paradise and privacy of our walled property.
wine socials daily

join us for a complimentary, hosted wine social every evening before
            you explore the variety of great dining opportunities panama city beach has to offer.




unique rooms

each of our 14 rooms is individually decorated with a particular theme
            or style. take a look at them all and see which one strikes your fancy.
lush tropical setting

relax as you immerse yourself in the beauty of our tropical gardens.
            green thumbs aren't needed to appreciate the variety & beauty of the surroundings.
complimentary extras

large, fresh beach towels are provided daily for use at the pool or beach.
            we're also happy to provide our guests beach chairs and market umbrellas.
