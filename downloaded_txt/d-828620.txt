we take the “con” out of “contractor.”

working in area homes for more than half of a century, a contractor doesn’t earn a near 5-star google rating without doing something right. we also maintain an a+ rating with the better business bureau and have a reputation for excellence in all of our work.
to set ourselves apart from the competition, we at five star uphold a set of five core values that include integrity, generosity, adaptability, dependability and innovation.






integrity
we always strive to do the right thing. we believe what we do when no one is looking defines who we truly are.






generosity
we continually seek opportunities to serve others with a samaritan mindset.






adaptability
we make critical decisions to better capitalize on every opportunity.






dependability
we do everything we say we will, and we don’t make promises that can’t be kept.






innovation
we bring new ideas to life. we push to be better and be industry disruptors while never settling for just “okay.”
