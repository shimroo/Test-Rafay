the journey ahead 

                    today we are embarking on a new journey for our 2030 destination.  
                               a particularly significant element of this process is the emergence of a global media that delivers information in a flash, everywhere from brazil to the uae to china and beyond. in a single hour today, more people and goods move from city to city, country to country, continent to continent than moved in the entire 18th or 19th centuries. 
                













 our strength 
we have continually capitalized on our strengths, resources and knowledge-base to bring out the latest information on global trends and best practices, benefiting business, management, and the ict industry in the region. in this era of massive globalization.
