pre order is now sold out. regular order books will ship in march, 2025. xo"emerald drifters is so beautiful. i've always wondered what synesthesia felt like, and i imagine it would be a bit like waking up inside one of the photographs in this book." stella bugbee - styles editor nyt"the way cig thinks and writes and makes photos all about color and light and art and life, wrapped up in this delicious package… i can’t get enough. it reminds me why i love photography, why i ache for midcoast maine, why being a mother is extraordinary, that light and beauty is everywhere and that friends who inspire you are the greatest gift."morrigan mccarthy - managing photo editor at wall street journal"emerald drifters fills me with awe and envy. cig harvey is not only an extraordinary imagemaker but a terrific writer. i turn each page filled with wonder and gratitude for the beauty and tenderness of her photographs; the empathetic and resonant observational powers of her words. cig harvey has created a perfect vessel to contain the heartbreaking and fugitive radiance of color in our world and in our memories."mark alice durrant, publisher, saint lucy books
