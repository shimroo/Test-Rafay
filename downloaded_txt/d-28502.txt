featured: pair of 18th century clodion bronze figures
this magnificent matched pair of bronze figures was created by the well known bronzier clodion in the late 18th century. the pair is a fantastic reflection of clodion’s skill and celebration of the rococo style.
here, we see a pair of satyrs strolling in the woods next to a stump of a tree, smiling joyously at one another. each holds a bronze d’ore horn with a round end and a musical instrument.
