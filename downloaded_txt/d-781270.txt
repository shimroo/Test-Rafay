welcome to the historical museum at fort missoula
the museum at fort missoula acknowledges that we are in the homelands of the salish and kalispel people. we offer our respect for their history and culture, and for their wisdom in caring for this place for the generations to come.
we invite visitors to explore the rich history of western montana found throughout our 32 acre historic park.
some of missoula county’s fascinating history you will discover includes: early fort history dating from its establishment in 1877 in the midst of the indian wars; the exploits of the all african american 25th infantry bicycle corps, the century or more of the forest products industry’s culture and innovations; and the world war ii internment camp that once held over 2200 italian and japanese nationals.

over 20 preserved historic buildings and structures bring this history to life on our grounds.
we feature rotating exhibits designed for every age group exploring a range of thought-provoking historical topics. we also host a variety of fun and educational events throughout the year. please visit us at the historical museum.
your support and interest keeps missoula’s history alive.
