a montessori school for children ages 18 months to 14 years
  

schedule a tour




    montessori education prepares children for life.

we celebrate each child’s individuality and help them discover how they can best contribute to our world and culture. all children are naturally curious and love to learn; we support this innate drive by providing environments that meet children’s developmental needs, by having a staff of loving and well-prepared adults, and by building a community of families that actively support our mission. 



    why do so many families choose montessori?

      









 individualized learning

lessons are designed and given to each child when they are most ready to learn.

   


 whole child education

social, emotional, and physical development is emphasized along with academic skills.

   


 empowered by choice

freedom to move and choose activities fosters independence and self-confidence.

   


 supported by research

current neurology and human development research consistently backs montessori.

“looking back at my years at providence from first through eighth grade i remember my teachers instilling in me that my ideas, questions, and work mattered. it gave me confidence that has stayed with me as i work through challenges in college. providence was a major part of my childhood that i know helps me in so many ways. i would not be the student or person i am today without those years with such loving and invested staff. you knew you were valued and for that i am grateful. i look forward to giving back someday so that others will have the same opportunity. thank you!”
 - shelby b.

    

 

 

 

 




my wife and i find providence the most special place to send our two children because of the lifestyle lessons that the children receive here. in my experience in other schools and in new york and other boards, i have never encountered a school or staff where the faculty care so much for the children. they care for them as if they are their own. i can’t imagine sending my children to any other school. the staff and the faculty are tremendous and supportive and the education that our children receive is unparalleled.

one of our favorite things about providence has been the worldview our daughter developed. from her first year as a 3 year old in the primary program, she began learning the continents and about customs and cultures from around the world. as she grew older, she learned about issues facing our community, country and world and the power and impact of her own actions. from a young age, she was allowed to tackle challenging societal issues through research, open dialogue and debate. she was able to form her own opinions, while working to understand differing opinions of her classmates. she has a deep understanding of her place in the world, her connectedness to others and her ability to affect change. providence’s emphasis on peace and the interconnectedness of all people has undoubtedly had a profound impact on our daughter’s development.
 - heather & joey b.
