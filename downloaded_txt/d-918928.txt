q: what is lipoic acid?  

lipoic acid is a vitamin-like substance naturally produced by the human body. in addition to neutralizing dangerous free radicals, lipoic acid is also essential for the production of cellular energy.*




q: what is bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid?  

bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid is formulated using a unique stabilization process that ensures maximum absorption. pharmacokinetic data has shown that our bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid products have 40x the absorption rate of unstabilized rla.




q: why take r-lipoic acid (rla)?  

r-lipoic acid has powerful antioxidant functions:it is essential for the production of cellular energy in the form of atp, so it actually delivers a boost of energy*regulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolismhas been shown to reduce inflammatory conditionsis neuroprotective, as it crosses the blood brain barriercan chelate heavy metalscan reverse enzyme and dna oxidative damageincreases glutathione productioncan boost glucose metabolismmay help improve insulin sensitivity, reducing blood sugar levels




q: what is the difference between  r-lipoic acid and alpha lipoic acid?  

alpha-lipoic acid consists of a 50/50 mixture of the r (natural) and s (unnatural) forms of this molecule. it is the most widely available commercial form of lipoic acid. r-lipoic acid is the form of lipoic acid that occurs naturally in plants, animals and the body and is responsible for the specific beneficial effects of alpha lipoic acid.















 







exploring the benefits of bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid 



geronova's bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid has been shown to provide superior bioavailability, stability, and potency compared to other forms of lipoic acid providing a range of health benefits.this is because we convert the biologically active "r" form of lipoic acid to sodium r-lipoic acid (na rla), which can achieve 10-30 times higher peak blood levels than pure, unstabilized r-lipoic acid (rla).
a human study found that bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid is rapidly absorbed and metabolized more efficiently than either alpha-lipoic acid (ala) or rla and also results in higher serum concentrations, making bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid a more effective option.
if you want to experience the most positive health effects of lipoic acid, bio-enhanced® r-lipoic acid is your best choice.

good formula, no stomach impacts. 



i can take this from of lipoic acid with confidence that i will not experience the stomach upset encountered with alpha- versions and with the same good effect eliminating skin pain. understand, i don't take it to treat pain, i take it to boost my levels so that the root cause is eliminated.

helped to greatly reduce neuropathy pain 



i heard about aloalipoic acid for neuropathy. i tried it to no avail. then i saw an advertisement for this brand explaining how it is absorbed by the body better than ala. so glad i found it. this along with red light therapy slippers and nutritional yeast and methylated b12 have nearly eliminated all my pain. just have a little annoying numbness in bed at night.
