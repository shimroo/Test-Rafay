new orleans plastic surgeon dr. moses
an artist’s sensibility & 35+ years experience in aesthetic medicine
our treatments are all about you. that’s because dr. moses believes plastic surgery is not about making people pretty, thin, sexy, or younger. rather, when aesthetic medicine works well, it changes how you feel about yourself. the goal is for you to love the way you look.

our new orleans plastic surgery office is a beautiful, elegant facility for treatments and includes a private, on-site surgery center, skincare treatment center, and overnight recovery rooms
our office is in an old mansion that overlooks st. charles avenue and the garden district. it doesn’t look or feel like a typical doctor’s office; you’ll notice right away how calm and beautiful it is. in this relaxing setting, you can learn all about non-surgical treatments and plastic surgery with dr. moses. you can also receive treatment in our lovely treatment rooms. if you choose a surgical procedure, you’ll appreciate the privacy of our on-site certified surgical center, and can also choose to recover in our beautiful suites.
we think you’ll appreciate the combination of a discreet, elegant facility, an outstanding board-certified plastic surgeon, a caring staff, and, most of all, natural-looking results.
