"since using orascoptic loupes i have better posture, and the pain in my neck has gone away. i would definitely recommend these loupes to any hygienest."

jessica parks, rdh









"i'm currently using the eyezoom™. it has three different magnifications: 3x,4x,5x. i usually use the 4x and, if i want to get really close up i'll go to the 5x. if i want more of an overview, i'll go to the 3x magnification. it's very versatile.”
