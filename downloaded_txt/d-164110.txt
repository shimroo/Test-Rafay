john l. jacobus


the fisher body craftsman's guild 
                                was a national auto design competition sponsored 
                                by the fisher body division of general motors. 
                                this competition was for teenagers to compete 
                                for college scholarships by designing and building 
                                scale model "dream" cars. held from 
                                the 1930s through the 1960s, it helped identify 
                                and nurture a whole generation of designers and 
                                design executives.

                                this richly illustrated book presents the history 
                                of the fisher body craftsman's guild, from its 
                                inception as a philanthropic project by the fisher 
                                family during the great depression, to its expansion 
                                overseas, and finally to its end in 1968. many 
                                former participants in this famous model building 
                                and design competition share their memories and 
                                photographs of their models, some of which are 
                                startlingly inventive even when viewed today.

                                among those designers and design executives who 
                                participated in the guild are virgil m. exner, 
                                jr., charles m. jordan, robert w. henderson, robert 
                                a. cadaret, richard arbib, elia 'russ' russinoff, 
                                galen wickersham, ronald c. hill, edward f. taylor, 
                                george r. chartier, charles w. pelly, gary graham, 
                                charles a. gibilterra, e. arthur russell, william 
                                a. moore, terry r. henline, paul tatseos, allen 
                                t. weideman, kenneth j. dowd, stuart shuster, 
                                john m. mellberg, harry e. schoepf, and ronald 
                                j. will. the book also describes many aspects 
                                of the miniature model napoleonic coach and other 
                                scale model cars the students designed.
