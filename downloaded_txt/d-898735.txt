january 2024  nursery update.
john, ingrid and sarah continue to run the nursery and edwina, and now her son ryan, keep our plants in good condition and the nursery tidy and interesting.
rachel has left us to branch out on her own.
our auriculas seem to be increasing in number and new benches are being made to accommodate them.
in 2022 we achieved our first rhs gold medal at malvern spring show and in 2023, we were the master growers at the show.  this year we have not been invited to attend the show so we will be concentrating on nursery and mail order sales.
sarah is adopting 2 small children so being at home makes life easier for us all.  (from one nursery to another.)
we will just be attending gardeners world (nec) and tatton flower show but will attend many other one-day sales.
all the best for 2024, ingrid, john and sarah.






we still give talks and are happy to have groups here, either to look around or to have a talk, or both, with coffee and cake provided.
just enquire. (01746 716 454).

talks
we are available to give talks on the following subjects and if we have enough notice, can tailor one of our talks to you needs/situation, or create a new talk for you. we use a digital projector and can bring our own equipment and plants for sale if you wish.

“plant hunting” on holiday: a look at plants we have seen when on holiday that we would like to share with you. many we know as houseplants or half-hardy perennials.
herbaceous perennials: a look at a range of really reliable perennials and some that you may not have seen before.
plants for autumn colour in the garden: how to reinvigorate the garden after the summer perennials are over.
propagation (practical) by john millington: this can be tailored to the season and to your members’ interests.
the dry garden: plants that will grow in dry soils (or what not to grow if you have a wet garden!)
primulas and auriculas by john and ingrid millington: a look at just a few of the 100’s of primulas available, followed by a foray into the world of auriculas.
acanthus. an exploration into the world of the acanthus, including history, influence and other plants in the acanthus family.
bulbs for the garden throughout the year. tubers, corms and bulbs that can really enhance your garden and how and where to grow them.
trees for smaller gardens. how to choose trees that are suitable for smaller gardens and to give ideas of what is available.
plants for early spring. plants for spring flowers and foliage that you may not be familiar with.
summer plants in the garden. plants that are at their best in the summer.






visits
we are happy to receive daytime or evening visits from gardening clubs, etc. there is room for a coach to park at the end of our lane (by pre arrangement with the farmer) and we can give a talk, guided tour, provide light refreshments or whatever else you may need.
just give us a call for further details. 01746 716 454.
