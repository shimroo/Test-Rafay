claudia: i feel that it was a blessing that i was
  able to find you to do the surgery and i am so happy that i chose the ced procedure
  instead of a fusion... this fall, my husband, bob, and i took our harleys
    			  and we rode all the way to branson, missouri and back! all
total was 5,500 miles!

richard:i was eventually diagnosed as having a herniated disc which
      was confirmed as a left l4-5 bulge on an mri exam... now,
  i seldom think about my back, i am pain free, all lower extremity symptoms
  have resolved, and i am able to participate in all physical activities without
  discomfort just as i did before the herniated discs occurred.  read more...

phil: it’s been almost 1 year 
      since my ced procedure and
      i 
      am very pleased with the results. improvement was evident immediately
      post op, allowing me to spend the entire next day sightseeing with my wife.
      avoiding the use of narcotic pain meds was a huge plus since i do not tolerate
      their side effects. i still cannot believe that this much simpler procedure
      saved me from the more invasive level 2 cervical fusion that appeared to
      be my only option before learning of your ced procedure.
