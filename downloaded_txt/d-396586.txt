a triumph of style



so why should i play a kay?


what can you say... kay guitars are just plain cool!  from the world-famous and instantly recognizable "kelvonator" headstock all the way down to the "blade" and "kleenex box" pickups, kay guitars pay homage to an "art-deco" era where sophistication and style were just as important as sound and playability.


kay vintage reissue guitars are masterpieces of art as well as fine musical instruments with a unique sound and feel you will not find with any other guitar.


 kay guitars have been played by some of the world's most recognizable musicians.  taylor swift, paul mccartney, elvis presley, eric clapton, dwayne eddy, barney kessel..... the list goes on.  featured below are some of kay's notable artists and players, past and present.


wouldn't you like to be part of the legacy that showcases some of the most influential and exciting players on earth?
