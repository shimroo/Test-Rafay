“i want my patients to know they can trust that i will look out for their best interest.”
christoper patronella, md







if i could rate 10 stars i would! i have been a patient of dr. patronella for almost 10 years. i have undergone 3 breast augmentation procedures with him. i was 20 years old on my first one, second one i increased in size and recently my third.. for personal reasons smaller implants (to) better suit my lifestyle. … truly, dr. patronellas work is beyond my expectations, i’m incredibly happy i could cry. …
— a.g.


dr. p and staff, i want to say thanks for all your kindness and for taking such good care of me. everyone made me feel special. flying out of state for my surgery was the best decision i made. i am still on the road to recovery and am confident that my final results will be 110% of what i expected…
-m


dr. patronella was the only doctor i trusted to remove that skin and transform my body into the vision i had in my mind’s eye. he asked me what my goal was and i said: to look good in my clothes. he accomplished that and so much more! i am so pleased with my results and feel so much more confident. i am no longer avoiding mirrors or cameras!
— m.c.


thank you so much for your professionalism and wonderful atttention to patients like me! i have been so incredibly impressed every time i walk in the office! i am so pleased with my procedures healing and cannot express my gratitude enough!
thank you!
— c.


i have officially been a patient of christopher pattonella for several months and have had facial surgery… my results were amazing and he has been there to answer questions and give support if needed. … exceptional experience on all levels!!

“i think my tummy looks better now than it did before kids!” — kelly
patient transformation: mommy makeover
i began modeling as a teenager, and had a successful career based in new york city, until my late twenties. as i approached my thirties, i decided to move on to the next chapter of my life: motherhood.
in spite of this wonderful new purpose in my life, i was still going through a grieving process of my “old” self. my body had changed, which i tried to accept as a “badge of honor”, but deep down really struggled with.
i had a pooch that wouldn’t budge.
