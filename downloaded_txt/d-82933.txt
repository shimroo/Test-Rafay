            what do you think of switching from at-large to by-district elections?




los altos made the transition in 2024 for council-based elections. the mountain view los altos high school district is transitioning now for school board elections.

you voted: 






 in favor – district elections allow for better representation
                                



 not in favor – voters are limited to one seat instead of five
                                



 neither alternative is good
