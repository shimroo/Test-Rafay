17th-dec-2006 04:58 pm - finallymoondust0109you are a bright star soullike a shining star, you have no trouble being the center of attentionin fact, you often feel a bit hurt when all eyes aren't on youyou need to be number one in everything, no matter how trivialand it's this ego that both hurts your confidence and helps you acheiveyou're dramatic and a powerhouse of pure energyyou posess a divine quality or uniqueness that's hard to definea natural performer, it's likely you'll become famous in some circles.just learn not to take everyone's reaction to you so personally!souls you are most compatible with: newborn soul and prophet soulwhat kind of soul are you?i really need to start keeping a journal again.mood:apathetic

30th-jun-2006 11:31 am - porque te vasmoondust0109so, this is the end.  okay, not really, but it sure feels like it.  i'm leaving home for a month, to travel around spain (and briefly paris) all by myself.  that should be interesting.  and then i'll be a junior.  which i'm not too pleased about.i'm sorry i've been such a bad friend.  i really plan to comment more, but my problem is that i do things mentally and then somehow think i've actually done it.  for example, i read over entries and think of a comment, but i forget to actually type something out.  or i write my stories in my mind.  yeah, i'm an odd one.  anyway, forgive me.no more icons for a month either.  hell, no more english for a month.  okay, well, i'll be speaking english in france since i know exactly two words in french: pardon, and oui.  lol.check out my last post on sight_seeing for more information.  adiosmood:contemplative
