cabo san lucas marine park
just a 5 minute ride away from the marina, we can dive famous sites such as pelican rock, north wall, and land’s end. due to its protected status, the marine park offers incredible levels of biodiversity, huge schools of fish, a sea lion colony, and the odd sighting of larger pelagic animals such as mantas and whale sharks. with a combination of deep walls and shallow reefs, scuba diving cabo san lucas is for all experience levels. read more
the corridor
after a wonderful cruise up the cabo coastline we make it to the more tranquil cabo corridor. this is an area full of life, most notably marine mammals and migrating rays, pods of bottlenose dolphins, humbacks (seasonally) and jumping mobula rays are often seen on the way to the 5 great dive sites the corridor has to offer. a more desired destination due to the lower number of divers and boats but still possible for all levels of diver. read more
