the scout patch collectors base camp




















the scout patch collector's base camp is a directory of helpful internet resources for pursuing our hobby of collecting and trading scout memorabilia. we also strive to promote collaboration and teamwork to help preserve the heritage of scouting, and seek to become a meeting place to build and strengthen fellowship among collectors. serving patch hobbyists since november, 2000, the base camp is freshly revised with new links and many new features. over 400,000 people from over 100 countries have visited since the site launch.   * newly added link.
