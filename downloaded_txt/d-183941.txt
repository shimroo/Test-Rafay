- grass weaving -













an 
                      ordinary, nondescript plant growing in the rice
                      paddies and marshlands of korea, often cast aside,
                      is transformed into an exquisite art form, a work of
                      beauty so fine it seems unbelievable that it was
                      made by human hands. wancho weaving is the
                      result not only of years of training by the craftsman, but also 
                      of incredible patience and dexterity. to be able to harness 
                      nature into such harmonious,

                      blessed with a mastery that can only be considered
                      extraordinary... more
