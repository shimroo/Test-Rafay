in this intimate and open accountânothing like any rock-and-roll memoir youâve ever readâalex van halen shares his personal story of family, friendship, music and brotherly love in a remarkable tribute to his beloved brother and band mate.
told with acclaimed new yorker writer ariel levy, brothers is seventy-year-old drummer alex van halenâs love letter to his younger brother, edward, (maybe âed,â but never âeddieâ), written while still mourning his untimely death.



âthis is my tribute to my brother; my way of saying goodbye. ed, i love you and miss you. when i see you again, iâm gonna kick your ass!â
- alex van halen
