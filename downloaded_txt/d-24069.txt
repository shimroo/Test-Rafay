                                        so tall and elegant… looked perfect at our holiday celebration.  a little less flowers than they showed in the picture. maybe that was the larger size one

                                        many thanks to hirni’s for using its beautiful “rain forest” design to create the perfect floral arrangement for a funeral. 

it was very important to the senders, most of whom could not attend the funeral, to show our love and support for our friend by having flowers that reflect who she is. the typical funeral arrangement would not have achieved that. 

hirni’s did so well that our friend wrote: “thank you guys for the beautiful flower arrangement. i love that it was so colorful and tropical!  it’s the only arrangement i took home!  thank you for your thoughtfulness and your friendship. love you guys!”

thank you, hirni’s!

                                        the arrangement was beautiful! i’ve been sending my mother flowers through hirni’s for the last several years. they consistently exceed my expectations, and get much better value (and higher quality) compared to the big commercial stores.
