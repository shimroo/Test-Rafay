a note from dr. homquist.
	    hi folks
thank you for checking out home chiropractic.
as a fact of history d. d. palmer, the first chiropractor in 1895 was self-taught and
proceeded to teach others from his home. after a short time he would tell his students to
go out, hang up a shingle and start adjusting people. those early chiropractors built
the largest natural healing profession in the world using just their hands and simple tables.
x-ray technology wasnt even available until 30  40 years later. they were self-taught
men and women that didnt even have a book / video or dvd as a guide. i bring this to
your attention to show the simplicity of the wonderful old time chiropractic philosophy,
science and art, proving its possible for you to teach yourself as well.
i feel sure if you avail yourself of home chiropractic youll be happy to have it
around your home

        my best to you
        dr. karl (hover here)
