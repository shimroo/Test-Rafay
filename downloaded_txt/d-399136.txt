silencing cheney dissent  how the mormon church obstructed 911 justice
          - in 2006, the 911 truth movement singled out vice
  president dick cheney as the first choice for being brought to justice for his
  treasonous acts in complicity with the attacks of sept. 11, 2001.  that
  movement was silenced when lds-owned byu honored the traitor in their
  commencement exercises in 2007, along with removing the outspoken steven e.
  jones from byu. (patriotsaints;

          role in 9/11 cover-up - established to be a pillar of
          scientific accuracy, the national institute of standards and
          technology (nist) has prostituted itself in the case of its role in
          helping the dark elements of the u.s. government to cover their tracks
          of culpability in the 9/11 tragedy. compilation by sterling
          d. allan, son of nist atomic clock physicist. (patriotsaints; dec. 10,

description:
              patriot saints branches are local,
          autonomous units that may or may not choose to affiliate with remnant
          saints international patriot alliance, whose governing body is remnant
          saints inter-continental congress.
             a local patriot saints branch is designed be the most fundamental unit of
          government beyond the family.  it is where most of the issues of governance will be
          handled in the ideal society.  very few matters will need to go beyond the local
          branch, which will be made up of 10 to 12 families.  it hearkens to moses' concept of
          captains of ten, captains of fifty, etc.
