cashmere!!!!
[03 feb 2007|03:40am]





i have worked with cashmere before and wasn't that impressed, but this black pearl cashmere is like butter, take a peek here:http://www.oneplanetyarnandfiber.com/dk_weight_cashmere_yarns_s/24.htmof course you know i had to design something with it, i did a shrug, not released yet but soon and a lacy camisole for for one planet yarn and fiber.  here's the pics of the cami in a ribboned and plain version.  here's the link to their blog so see their other patterns:http://oneplanetyarnandfiber.blogspot.com/they also have a wool and tencel fingering weight i'm absolutely in love with, can't show the picture of the piece i made with it yet.  more designs to come...so stay tuned....same yarn time...same yarn channel...  o.k so nice yarn makes me giddy!!!

i'm still alive and kicking!
[03 feb 2007|03:28am]





well happy new year all!  i know i'm kinda late with it, but i've been busy, busy, busy.  last year has been spent working on publishing commitments and i have to say waiting for publications to be releases requires a lot more patience than i own.  one of the pieces i did for plymouth yarns was a military style jacket, its on their site but i can't see the details from the pic and unfortunately i only took a pic of it on my desk.  here's the link to their pattern:http://www.plymouthyarn.com/index.php?nav=cpatterns.patterngallery&yarn_id=000110&pattern_id=001316 and shot and heres my pic.

snb the happy hooker
[07 mar 2006|11:48am]





i decided to wait until the book hit the shelf before i posted this. the first 2 pics were taken by me just for a personal record. all three versions work for me.  let me just say congrats to everyone involved in the book.  my daughter is going to enjoy this book, i am going to give her one of the copies.  i have yet to read it, i just skimmed through it for now.  just so you know i couldn't wait for my contributors copy to arrive so i went out and bought one.  :)  it was nice to see 'la vonne' in the name, publisher usually cut that out. thanks debbie! the short and sweet design started out like this: then it became this: and finally this:

happy new year
[15 jan 2006|08:22pm]





happy new year everyone.  i have been mega busy, with patterns for books, mags and companies.  did my ususal 3 xmas craft shows, did very well with it. taught some workshops in between that too and of course work for my customers and crochet for a designer for her clothing line.  when did i sleep you ask?  not too much, glad most of that is over.  i had some fun with the spiral scarves sold alot at the shows added a hat to go with them.  i'm sure i'm going to get some flack about jumping on the band wagon, but such is life.    here is a pic of one of the  hat and scarf sets, not very good pics but you can see how its done.

crochet jewelry
[24 sep 2005|12:25pm]





while looking at a fashion show of marc jacobs fall 2005 ready to wear collection.  i saw a model in a black outfit with a large gold chain, this was some serious blingage.  i don't usually like such large jewelry but this necklage just had me staring at it.  well guess what it was crocheted chain links.  lol, so you know what i had to do.  here is what i did, i used a spool knitter then chained the finished product, not having much time to sit and crochet the whole thing.  btw, its one piece just maniputlated different ways.
