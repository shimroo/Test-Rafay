welcome to noahsarksearch.com and the historic search for noah’s ark in the highlands of urartu from genesis 8:4. enjoy the journey!

the noahsarksearch.com website includes the explorers of ararat: and the search for noah’s ark book and the arcimaging (archaeological imaging research consortium) research team and discusses many views.
noah’s ark has not been documented and despite the alleged eyewitnesses in the 20th century, there are questions whether it could have survived from the cataclysmic flood until the present day. this website provides a “big tent” for ark researchers to share their information and research about the historical search for noah’s ark.
primary areas people have searched for the remains of noah’s ark include the biblical “mountains of urartu/ararat” including mount ararat and durupinar as well as outside the region including mt. cudi and iran’s mount sabalan along with the zagros mountains and fellow author b.j. corbin’s book, seven mountains to arrata.




a comprehensive overview:



the best way to get a comprehensive understanding about the search for noah’s ark is to:
1) read the urartu and noah’s ark search overview.
2) read the urartu/ararat boundaries. 
3) read the mount ararat archaeological survey where rex geissler and ataturk university professors and israel archaeologist dr. david livingston surveyed the archaeology in the mount ararat plain including the oldest chalcolithic civilization that arose in this same region called the early transcaucasian culture (etc) or kura–araxes(araz) culture with black/brown/red ceramic ware (pottery) dated from ca. 4000 bce down to 2000 bce.  rex geissler also surveyed numerous urartian archaeological sites as urartu is first mentioned on a campaign of assyrian king shalmaneser i in the early 13th century bce although it probably existed prior to that.
4) read the mount ararat geological survey. 
5) read the search for noah’s ark online presentation. 
6) read the durupinar geologic overview, the formation and mechanics of the great telceker earth flow by turkish geologist murat avci.  durupinar is popular due to the colorful storyteller ron wyatt.
7) read the classic noah’s ark search book with hundreds of photos, the explorers of ararat: and the search for noah’s ark. the 3rd edition of the book is being published online and most of it is already available. 
8) photos of sodom (tall el-hammam) across jordan river valley from jericho in the kingdom of jordan:
