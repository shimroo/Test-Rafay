are we ready for medical examiner reforms for neonatal death certification?shanvir mann, gee-na beeston, simon clark



                            neonatal death is a tragic event that has a profound impact on the family. issuance of a death certificate is an essential step in the bereavement and legal process, to enable closure for the loved ones. as medical practitioners, it is paramount to provide accurate and sensitive death certificates. it is very important that the most accurate picture possible for the complex train of events leading to a neonatal death is drawn from the summary that the death certificate provides.1

prematurity with disorder of sex development. case report of a gestational age estimation challengerukhsar osman, yaser abdallah



                            newborn complications and deaths decrease as gestational age increases. therefore, determining gestational age accurately is necessary in managing newborns appropriately. a newborn with dysmorphic genitalia was delivered at our facility to a mother unsure of her dates. determining gestational age by the new ballard score (nbs) was therefore challenging, hence foot length was used, which estimated the age at 31 weeks. a quick method such as measuring foot length can be used as an alternative to estimate gestational age in preterm neonates with disorder of sex development where nbs can not be used to assess maturity of external genitalia.

 free  human milk oligosaccharides and necrotising enterocolitiskristina chmelova, andrea c masi, janet e berrington

                        human milk is known to reduce the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in preterm infants, but mechanisms are poorly understood. human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are complex sugars produced by the mammary gland and present in variable amounts in different breast milks. animal models show hmos impact on development of nec and humanpreterm infant studies show a specific hmo, called disialyllacto-n-tetraose (dslnt), is present in maternal milk in lower amounts in infants who go on to develop nec. this article reviews the role of hmos in nec development and the clinical data in preterm infants, and considers the possible next steps for supplementation in preterm infants.
