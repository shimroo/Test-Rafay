christ's
ministry not complete at the cross see
note
with ex. 25. no excuse for sin go
.
"the conditions
prevailing in society, and especially in the great cities of the nations,
proclaim in thunder tones that the hour of god's judgment is come and that
the end of all things earthly is at hand. we are standing on the threshold
of the crisis of the ages. in quick succession
the judgments of god will follow one another - fire, and flood, and earthquake,
with war and bloodshed. . . . the storm
of god's wrath is gathering; and those only will stand who respond to the
invitations of mercy, . . . and become sanctified through obedience to
the laws of the divine ruler. the righteous alone will be hid with christ
in god till the desolation be overpast...."

statement of faith - confidence in the
bible
   i accept the
scriptures the way they have come to us - as the word of god. in looking
closely, i have found them to be consistent and reliable. we can understand
them by studying the context and related bible passages. furthermore, i
hold that the same holy spirit who inspired them has protected their messages
through the centuries, and indeed will help us understand them. i accept
that they were given for doctrine as paul wrote to timothy. i also believe
that they are totally adequate as a guide to belief and practice.
    i encourage
you to take your own bible and read for yourself. also, i'm not a prophet
so when i say something you have reason to question, be like the bereans
who, when they heard paul, searched the scriptures to discover if he was
telling them the truth. at first, they didn't know he was a prophet.
   the king james
version is used because it is widely accepted and in the public domain.
it is also a good translation although for some passages, other versions
have better represented the manuscripts. as needed, we look at word meanings
from the original languages.
what we do not supply
    the word
of god is precious and far beyond human wisdom (isa. 55:8; prov. 3:5).
but he has promised the holy spirit to help us understand (john 16:13).
so, whenever you open the sacred word, also open your heart to god in prayer,
allowing the words of this commentary to direct your thoughts to the scriptures
and to the one they tell us about.
