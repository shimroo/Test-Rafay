					adhesive dispensing systems



adhesive dispensing ltd provide 
					dispensing machines and products for the controlled 
					application of most adhesives, sealants, lubricants, epoxies 
					and many other assembly fluids. systems that eliminate 
					material waste, improve process control and eliminate 
					operator hand fatigue. simple solutions to dispensing 
					processes from low volume applications, prototype assembly, 
					field work, automated production cells or high volume 
					assembly lines. we hold in stock thousands of spares and 
					consumables.













our systems range from portable 
					hand dispensers to air-powered timed-shot dispensers, high 
					speed metering valves and automated xyz robots. we can also 
					pack your specified adhesives, sealants, silicones, rtvs, 
					epoxies, inks, gels, greases and pastes pre-filled air-free 
					in a syringe barrels or cartridge component including 
					premixed and frozen dual component epoxies.
component 
					syringe barrels, needle tips and cartridge reservoirs, 
					mixers nozzles are industrial grade safe when used with 
					pneumatic dispensers. our components are certified silicone 
					free and are compatible with all major dispensing systems 
					available today. samples and data sheets of dispensing 
					components are available on request.

					solutions for activators, cyanoacrylates, sealants, rtv's, 
					silicones, lubricants, greases, epoxies, anaerobics, thread 
					lockers, uv, inks, paints, solder pastes, fluxes, braze 
					pastes, pva's, conformal coatings, solvents, primers and 
					most other fluids.

components


syringe
	barrel and 
	cartridge



 components, needle 
	


tips, 
	


nozzles, 
	


fluid
	lines, 
	   pinch tubes, 
	


caps.  use with adhesive 
	


dispensers and 
	


guns.  dual component cartridges up to 
	600ml.  also, 
	   bottles 
	with luer caps for manual applications. also 
	available are    mixer 
	nozzles, speciality type    nozzles and 
	


fittings.






syringeguns


hand operated 
	manual syringe guns for medium to high viscosity pastes, gels, sealants, 
	rtv, grease and epoxies. simple to use 
	for dots, beads or field applications.  7:1 ratio hand leverage eliminates hand fatigue. dispense action prevents 
	drips. low cost dispensing solutions.






cartridge guns


heavy duty 
	industrial  
	cartridge guns for sizes 
	30cc/ml to 950cc.  manual operated, 
	air-powered or electric.  guns for all industry standard
	cartridges, 
	   mixer cartridges and
	


techkit cartridges. guns are ideal 
	for controlled lines or potting of medium to high viscosity pastes, gels, 
	sealants, rtv, grease and epoxies.    






2k dual guns



 full range of 
	dual component cartridge guns for 50ml, 200ml, 300ml, 380ml, 400ml and 600ml
	dual cartridges and static
	mixer nozzles. basic manual applicators for 
	field work or low volume. pneumatic applicators are the standard for 
	assembly work. and new battery cordless for high levels of torque.    






air dispensers



dispensers 
	available for applying repeat dots, controlled lines or potting with most 
	materials including pastes, gels, rtv, sealants, pva, uv 
	cure, cyanoacrylate, epoxy, anaerobic, solvents, chemicals and solders.
	manual, timed or digital timed versions.
	

all dispensers use syringe barrels or cartridges.   






xyz robots


benchtop xyz
	robots systems in sizes from 200mm to 1200mm work 
	areas.  easy 
	programming for dots, lines, arcs, circles and potting.  available in 
	3 and 4 axis. robots for applying fast deposits of adhesives and assembly fluids.  
	can be supplied with syringe mount, valve head


or meter mix 
	valves.






shot valves


high precision 
	metering valves for single part fluids. ideal for bench stand 
	mounting, production line or robots.  special valves for 
	


spraying, 
	valves for cyanoacrylates, 
	uv cure adhesives as well as 
	


auger 
	motor driven valves. also available 
	are compact digital timed valve    controllers,
	


pressure pots & 
	


stands.  
	  






pressure pots


	industrial pressure pot tanks and feed pumps for the 
	transfer of materials in larger capacity. tank sizes 0.5 litre to 50 litre. 
	pail pumps for transfer of higher viscosity greases and sealants direct from 
	5, 25 and 50 litre pails. use pressure pots with valves and controllers for 
	a complete bulk system.

fume extractions systems for the safe working environment when handling 
	adhesives, glues, aerosols, soldering systems and solvents. removal of 
	fumes, vapours, mists, particles and dust to the control of hazardous to 
	health (coshh) regulations 2002 and 2004. recirculatory and full exhaust air 
	filter and extraction for all applications.






syringe fillers


a range of syringe filling systems for the clean and 
	quick transfer of adhesives, sealants, silicones and other materials from
	cartridges into any size 
	syringe barrel. material is fed under pressure to bottom fill the 
	syringe to eliminate mess, waste and air entrapment. simple to use systems.  
	 






accessories


useful 
	additions and accessories for guns, dispensers, valves and robots. bench
	stands, 
	finger switches,  

air 
	   filters and liquid
	


manifolds. we supply 
	an extensive range of products to support your existing dispensers or valves.  
	please contact us if you are looking for a particular part that you cannot 
	find on our website.    






packaging


receive 
	your specified adhesive, epoxy or assembly fluid pre-packaged in
	syringes, 
	cartridges,
	


techkits or pre-mixed and

	manually filling syringes or hand weighing then mixing epoxies. air free filled components improve dispensing applications 
	and reduce costs.






adhesive

a range of 
	industrial strength cyanoacrylate "instant" adhesives in 50g and 500g 
	bottles. high quality adhesives for bonding plastics, metals, rubbers, card 
	and paper. and a range of threadlockers, screw lock and gasket materials. 
	epoxy 
	resins and uv cure adhesives. all adhesives are industrial grade.
