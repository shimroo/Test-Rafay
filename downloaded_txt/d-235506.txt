grow in faith.  



st. peter’s enjoys active christian education and youth programs, and a wide variety of lay ministries and organizations are open to parishioner involvement. on sunday mornings and throughout the week you will have a chance to explore many opportunities for formation. we also have two services on sundays: a meditative  rite i  service at 7:30 am and a traditional rite ii service with organ music and choir at 10:30am.

journey  together. 



at st. peter’s we are growing in community together. we love jesus, we worship, we enjoy life together, and we care for the world god loves and all our neighbors in it. we are rich in tradition, but not stuffy. we are deeply rooted, but open-minded. we welcome all, but we will challenge you to grow. we are a community of disciples learning to follow jesus together. these weekly reflections will give you a taste of some of the things that make st. peter’s our faith home.
