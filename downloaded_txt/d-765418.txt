congratulations tom turner-next new regents' professor 2025-2027
may 2023
 
 
 
"the college of arts and sciences is pleased to announce its new regents’ professors. 
regents’ professor is a special title bestowed on selected full professors who, in the judgment of the dean and on the advice of a faculty selection committee, merit recognition of their accomplishments as teachers, scholars and leaders both in university affairs and in their national/international professional communities. in addition to the title “regents’ professor,” which is retained for the balance of an awardee’s career, this appointment also carries an annual stipend during the three-year term."
our curator of fishes, professor thomas turner, is one of three regents’ professors appointed for annual years 2025-2027!
