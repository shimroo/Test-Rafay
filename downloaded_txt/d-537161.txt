conjuring big-screen romance - by stephen holden - new york times
"imagine alice in wonderland as a beautiful dreamer besotted with old movies and vintage love songs. that enchanting, slightly unstable creature materialized at cafã© carlyle on tuesday evening in the person of maude maggart, a child of show business, whose new show, âthe door opened,â sprinkled fairy dust into the room. if you inhale too much of it, god help you. but in small amounts, it is an extremely seductive perfumewith her ethereal voice, whose spinning vibrato invites otherworldly apparitions that you might be tempted to confuse with reality, ms. maggart, who was accompanied on piano by john boswell, is a singular cabaret artist who conjures a dream world. magical transformations are commonplace."
