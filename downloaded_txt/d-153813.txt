in ancient times, all over the world, early people joined together to create villages, city-states, nations and empires.




archaeologists and scientists look for ways to learn about ancient 
			people by studying their geography, government, religion, inventions, and 
			daily life, to discover how people lived and what they accomplished 
			thousands of years ago. archaeologists have learned a great deal about these early civilizations from the 
artifacts (man-made objects) they left behind. come meet your ancestors. we think you'll find them amazing!
