fallen flag railroad photos



fallen flags and other railroad photos

 if you are interested, i have another site which covers my experiences
as a pilot in vietnam.  geo-sea130.org 

donation information 
i would like to thank those of you who have supported the site over the years either through donations or submitting
material to post. all have been great appreciated.


  submitting material & some legal stuff

i was looking through some old material and i found a graphic from the early years of this site. i started this site
in the early 1990's, back in the good old days. i started to track access in 1996 using harvard graphics. initial 
monthly access was less than 1000 per month. by 2003 the monthly average was about 60k per month. current access is less than that
as there are many other ways to get railroad information, much via youtube and mostly movies. i have an actual web site and not a
youtube channel.
while i continue to post current material, i do have an extensive set of fallen flags images. i have photos from the 1800's
with an extensive collection of steam locomotives. i also have manuals, drawing, maps and other material.
this site is a true labor of love as i spend hours every week processing material. i cover most of the cost even though i do receive some donations.
does anybody use this site? i never hear from visitors to the site and i
wonder if all my hours of work is being used. drop me a short note to let me
know if you are using the site.  thanks

 some thoughts 
because of the continuing changing leasing agreements, i have been placing
freight cars in their former operators. as an example, wells fargo has taken over the
leases on several different companies. as an example, all acfx and shpx marked cars are placed in the
acfx block. the freight cars (misc & private owner) page is very large containing many different
owners.


this is not a commercial site. i do not sell nor purchase
railroad related items.

copyright
all photos are copyright by george elwood, from my collection with credit
to the photographer or by the submitter. the photos may be used by
individuals for their personal non-commercial use (screen savers, modeling
effort, photo albums) without restriction.  reposting or other use requires
permission from the owner of the image or data.

further reproduction is prohibited! if you wish to purchase a copy of the
photo for commercial purposes, contact the individual who has submitted the
file. note - some emails or addresses are available in the major contributor
section.

i receive image files from other people and i assume that they belong to
the submitter. if i am notified that the image file is from another person, i
will remove the file from my system.


 comment  
thoughts - looking at some of the older photos being submitted, i wonder
how many collections head to the landfill after the owner dies. it is important
to capture these images and make them available as part the history of railroads.
if you or your parents have some older railroad photos, consider getting them
scanned.

submissions: if you plan on sending me submission material, please
contact me prior to mailing.
it is best to contact me and i will
provide an address to mail the material.


 reporting marks 
i post the images with the original company when posting images. over the
years various car owners have change, especially with leasing companies.


a note to persons searching for employee records
i do not nor do most railroad historical societies have any ex-railroad
personnel records in their archives. those records are most likely lost. it
is recommended that you contact the u.s. railroad retirement board.


search engines 
if you wonder why you don't see my site pop up in search engines, i 
made decision to stop this function.


will you share?
if you have slides or prints that you would like to share on this system,
please contact me. i would like to add more images to make other areas more
complete. i am looking for the older material for people who are modeling
in that time frame. -- thanks

new material
note - the images on these pages is also available on the individual
railroad pages in the system. all new images are double posted, in the new
material and in the rr master listing. the new data list is kept here for no
more than two months. submitted corrections are normally only made in the
master system.

note - i try to work several days ahead so if you submit image files via
email they may not show up the next day.

as noted above, i am always looking for new sources of older material.
do you, your father or grandfather have a collections of railroad photos
you wish to share?
