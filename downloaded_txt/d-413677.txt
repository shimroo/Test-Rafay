student perspectivebriana mays ’22major:marine biologyhometown:bradenton, fl
i chose mma because of the class sizes and the unique opportunities it presents. i am very far away from home, but i get a great education and i also get to play volleyball. since class sizes are small, you to form relationships with both your professors and classmates.

i was fortunate to find the classes i was looking for at cpmd! thanks to the hybrid option, i was able to take a portion of the training online before finishing with an in-person assessment. cpmd’s classes are informative, entertaining, and taught by knowledgeable instructors.
