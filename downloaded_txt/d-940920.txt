pace survey on gifted services for the 2020-21 school year


			posted on july 17, 2020 by kristin allison 




with so many gifted families working to find the best choices for their children, we also ask gifted families to consider completing an informal survey about where they are starting from in terms of gifted services this year. we will use this information to help guide the meeting’s discussion. even if you are unable to attend the discussion, we need to hear your ideas as we work together to develop effective strategies for serving our children in the coming year.

2020-21 gifted services pace virtual meeting – july 21, 7pm


			posted on july 13, 2020 by kristin allison 


columbus pace was formed as a group of volunteer parents who wanted to help our gifted children shine. for over 20 years families have worked together to learn about gifted education and enrichment, the social and emotional development of gifted children, and advocacy for all gifted students in columbus city schools. in these uncertain times, with reopening plans being discussed, columbus pace wants to give gifted families a chance to bring their concerns to the table so that we can work together with columbus city schools to provide needed support for all gifted students in the district. gifted families around the district all have different needs. they will need to choose different plans to best fit their work, health, safety, educational, and emotional needs. as a gifted community, we would like to brainstorm ways to provide support to all our students, regardless of the plan each family ultimately decides is best for them.join us to help prepare a list of questions and ideas for our gifted families to share with columbus city schools. please email pace@columbuspace.org for a link to our meeting. if you are unable to make the meeting, please feel free to share questions, concerns, and ideas prior to the meeting and we will make sure they are brought up.

november pace meeting
parent night with lisa van gemert, the “gifted guru”
lisa van gemert is a grown up gifted kid, herself, along with being a parent who has successfully raised gifted kids and an educator of gifted kids. she will be speaking about the delicate balance of boundaries with the gifted.â  from her website, the session is as follows: â “while gifted youth need more leeway and independence at earlier ages than do their typical learner peers, that doesnâ€™t mean they need less parenting. identifying and sustaining appropriate boundaries with peers, adult interaction, and even electronics can challenge the best and most dedicated of parents. â using a metaphor of fences, learn the key ideas parents need to find and maintain suitable guidelines for their children without dampening the childâ€™s spirits or feeling like theyâ€™ve surrendered all control to their kids.”
