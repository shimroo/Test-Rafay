★★★★★
i saw the vhby post on facebook and it reminded me that i wanted to let you both know that we have our boat for sale in san diego and we are in new zealand now on our new boat, a steve dashew fpb-64. you both were instrumental in getting v and me off to a good start in boating and we just wanted to say “thanks”. we lived on our prior boat for 6 years and put over 14,000 miles on her. last year we got as far south as the galapagos islands. we plan to continue cruising to more remote places on the new boat, but have no plans to return to the states for a while. thanks again for your help when we were in ventura. service does matter.
