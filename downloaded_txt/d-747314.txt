let's take back the nra




          the nra is at a crossroads, between danger and opportunity. we are choosing opportunity. who are we? we are nra 2.0 and we are forging a new path for the members of the nra. we are a majority of board members ready to meet the challenges and secure the future of the nra. we are concerned about the status quo of the organization and the internal issues that are impacting our mission. membership has been demanding a change and we are ready, willing, and able to make that change.
          we want to govern the nra based on integrity and transparency. we are dedicated to the fight and challenges that lie ahead, and we are committed. we are here to serve our members, with the support of our donors and industry. to do that though, we need your help. you must vote!
          if you are a voting member of the nra, you will receive your 2025 ballot in mid-january in one of the nra publications. on that ballot are 49 candidates running for a seat on the board of directors. only 28 of the 49 are supporters of nra 2.0. we need you to vote for all 28 of those candidates. who are they? next to the ballot is a list of those candidates and you can find out more about them now by clicking on this qr code:
          make your choice by completely filling in the circle next to the name with a pen or pencil. two are write-in candidates: charlie brown of dayton, oh, and paul babaz of atlanta, ga. please write in their full name, city and state. they were denied the opportunity to have their names printed on the ballot. please clearly write their names on the reverse of the ballot. these 28 candidates support the mission and core values of nra 2.0. they will fight for you and the nra, but without your support and vote, they wonât be able to wage that fight.
          we want to restore the trust and faith of the nra members because the nra exists for the members. we will continue to fight for the 2nd amendment and bring the nra back to its mission of creating and supporting shooting programs, competitive shooting, and furthering firearm safety and education. our goal is to bring the nra back to the mission and core values that made it the great organization it once was.
          we are asking for your vote in this upcoming election. mail it in before the deadline of april 6, 2025, and help us take back the nra! thank you!

    jim sheckels biography
i am running for the nra board of  directors (bod) through a signature petition campaign.â  i have been working closely with a reform  candidate group to get as many reformers as possible on the bod to take back  our nra!
          i believe the nra board bod must work  to gain back the trust of our membership through transparency; we must rebuild  our education, training, competition, and community outreach activities; and  the bod must take action to identify and remove anyone that is responsible for  allowing the situation to fester which saw the nra in the new york courts and  elsewhere.
          we can accomplish this by working with  the members and like-minded local grass roots organizations to put real reform  into the nra policies, select and elect 2a friendly state and local representatives  of the people, and develop good 2a friendly personal freedom legislation for  the people.
          i have several years of experience on  bods associated with hunting and 2a, and with scouting. 
          my skill set includes strategic /  long-term planning, budget formulation and execution, policy development,  programmatics, crisis management, problem identification and resolution, and  training & education.

          i spent most of the next 21 years as a  department of defense civil service employee.â   my positions included assignments with joint special operations command  (jsoc); us army special operations command (usasoc); the 82nd  airborne division; and joint forces command (jfcom).â  this civilian service included several  deployments to afghanistan, iraq, kuwait, qataar, and germany. i retired as a  gs-13 - senior civil servant while assigned as a civilian deputy command /  resource management director for the joint communications unit of jsoc.
          i have been an nra trainer since 2007,  and i have full credentialing in all disciplines as a training counselor (tc).  i was selected as one of the original group of nra regional tc liaisons and  serve mid-atlantic region 5 (north & south carolina, virginia, d.c.  maryland, west virginia, kentucky).â  i  have assisted with several tc development workshops and have trained thousands  of instructors and basic shooters in every discipline offered through nra  education & training.â  i am an nra lifetime  benefactor member and work with the cape fear friends of nra, raising funds for  the nra foundation.

    i strongly believe in our personal freedoms and god-given rights, 
          many of which are enshrined within the united states constitution.  
          i believe our personal freedoms are constantly under attack from 
          liberal and progressive forces.  i encourage all us citizens to educate yourself on the constitution, your freedoms guaranteed 
          therein, and to use only those businesses that support all of your 
          freedoms and rights.

          i call for a boycott of these businesses 
          or corporations that are taking action to erode your freedoms and 
          rights: dick's sporting goods; field & stream; walmart; levi's; 
          chipotle's; chili's; starbucks; sonic; target; yeti; panera bread; 
          whataburger; any business that posts signs on their premises 
          indicating that you must give up any or part of your freedoms and 
          rights to patronize them.

 i am the 
            nra - 
life member. 
            benefactor. recruiter. training 
            counselor / instructor / coach.
