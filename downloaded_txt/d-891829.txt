meetings agenda and minutes



browse the agenda/minutes
search documents






an archive of agenda and minutes for council, committee and
sub-committee meetings. prior to 2005 only a partial archive is
available. you can find documents either by searching by keywords
or by browsing through committees. once located, you can view
documents within your browser. if a document is located by
searching by keywords, you have the option of downloading extracts
of documents, rather than the whole file.
