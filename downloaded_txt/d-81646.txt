2 day cruise to stay™ in freeport bahamas


travel hints
my stay on freeport grand bahama island article by jay taylor, hotel411.com
2 day cruise to stay™ in grand bahama island, bahamas
hello, i’m jay taylor and these are hotelsi enjoy when i go to freeport grand bahama island.
flamingo bay hotel and marina share the property with taino beach resort, combined this is one of my favorite places to stay and play. taino beach has a nice quaint restaurant that has seating on the ocean and the scenery seems surreal.
the pool at flamingo bay hotel and marina is super large, shapeless and has a cove – cave bar inside it. the cave, swim up bar is a great way to get out from under the sun and enjoy a cool tropical drink.
another great spot for me is, our lucaya oceanfront resort and casino. this resort has great pools and one even has a swim up bar, ( i guess i like swim up bars).
for the romantic lover out there we have pelican bay resort. love the style of the rooms. besides being warm and romantic, these rooms are what i would build for myself at home. it’s not oceanfront, but it is on the bay and just across the street from the ocean.

2 day cruise to stay™ in freeport bahamas


1, 2, 3 or more night cruise and stay
viva wyndham fortuna beach resort, is oceanfront and is all inclusive. this property is a good choice for water sports tennis and other active stuff. the property itself is just ok by me. it is hard to beat a good, old fashioned, all inclusive place and this is it. yes, there are other hotels on the island, but for me, they are just not close enough to all the fun that is the area of lucaya. a tropical island near florida’s south coast, called grand bahama island, that has this all inclusive property includes meals, alcoholic, soft drinks and loads of water sport fun! called viva wyndham fortuna beach and includes:

the beach bar offers cocktails to guests by the outdoor pool or on the beach.
food at 3 restaurants
water activities including snorkeling and windsurfing.
oceanfront swimming pool

at one end of the our lucaya property is a small shack that serves up freshly caught sea food and old fashioned hamburgers and hotdogs called, billy joe’s on the beach. the owner at billy joe’s on the beach, used to walk around barefoot, i never asked why he started to put his sandals on. from time to time, they will have a live band, right there oceanfront and center. so, enjoy your super fresh conch salad, sip that icy tropical drink, listen to that island music and never want to go home.
no one can leave the island without taking a dolphin on a swim date. swim with the dolphins is one of the most popular things to do on the island.
