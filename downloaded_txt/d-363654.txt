about terry mcgee...
terry mcgee makes wooden flutes for irish, early and classical
music based on
the best of original instruments, including the popular rudall &
rose, pratten's
perfected and grey larsen preferred models.  based in malua bay, new south wales, australia, terry has been a
flute maker
since the mid seventies and exports his instruments to the four corners
of the
globe. 
terry's instruments are one-off craftsman-built instruments
using the finest materials and a combination of traditional and
modern techniques.  they show the benefit of the vast and
continuing research he has undertaken in australia and in
collections around the world. the most rigorous attention to
tuning makes his instruments the most precise and vibrant
available, and incorporation of new techniques makes them far
more rewarding to play than the best of the originals. on the
practical side, he has developed a new tuning slide which does
not cause splitting as did the traditional slide, and new key shapes to
improve ease of playing. 
terry also makes replacement parts and carries out repairs and
rebuilds for original instruments. this site includes extensive
information on flute care, history, research, choosing a flute,
fingering charts and links to other important flute resources.
