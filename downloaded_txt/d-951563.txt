how long has there been
complaints about blocked drainage in the hemmant and lindum areas?

the text below is of
that "letter to the editor" of 23 april 1928 

"hemmant
drainage.

sir,-the whole countryside at hemmant and lindum is under
water this morning. the fault lies with the mouths of existing old
drains having been filled up by the river dredges with silt pumped on
the banks. the population around here have approached the city
council time after time to have this evil remedied. letters also have
been written, and the progress association has made efforts, but all
of no avail. the situation becomes worse every time it rains, and has
reached a point now where some drastic action seems necessary at
once. we are paying higher rates, values have been increased,
and there is no doubt about it, we are getting practically no local
attention worth mentioning. after all, the local bodies were more
competent to deal with local affairs than this unwieldy greater
brisbane machine which has been set up, and seems to be unworkable,
to handle minor affairs, no matter how urgent they are. as drainage
is the first principle of health, and we have set up a health board,
with a mosquito department and other bodies, it would seem that some
practical action would be taken on these lines, especially when
several approaches have been made to the authorities in that
direction. however, the inactivity of a body set up to look
after public health and comfort is amazing. if the greater, brisbane
scheme is to have public approval and confidence, different lines of
action will be absolutely necessary to prove their .worth, and merit
their existence. so .far, .the public around here is sadly
disappointed with- their efforts and results, and has cause to be. we
have no-individual right to act, and w" cannot personally go and
remedy the drainage evil, under threat of legal action, and
collectively, though many efforts were made, and are still being
made, we seem to be also powerless. this state of affairs is very
serious. we cannot remedy the evil ourselves, and the body set up to
remedy it will not act. we really pay for service, but are refused
the service we pay for. we cannot clear out and leave our
places, where we have toiled and spent our money in improvements. the
old settlers here had a drainage board. they had drains dug, and
floodgates put in, and we, the advanced generation, allowed them to
collapse, and we allow further that the harbour board can bank up all
the possible means of water escape with silt out of the river, and we
look on powerless. 


we see our cultivations flooded, knowing that the neglect of duty
of the authorities we set up are responsible for the damage, yet we
are seemingly powerless to act. what is wrong here? someone must rise
up and move; some final effort must be made to improve the position.
drainage is the first principle of health and comfort, and it is the
council's bounden duty to see to it.

i am, sir, &c.

notice the
four box culverts.

then hemmant creek then
tries to flow out through the three pipe culverts in photo below.

just past (downstream)
these partially blocked pipes there is a very restrictive
tidal gate that doesn't
even hold back incoming tides.
eventually these
culverts were cleaned out before 13 december 2013 


 
don't wonder any more
why residents at hemmant suffer unnecessary flooding. 

hemmant creek's tidal
gate does it hold back flood waters.

lindum creek just after it was cleaned
out.

the gully along lindum creek was filled
in for acess and fill not removed.
the flood water just opened the blocked
drain and washed the fill into lindum creek. 

it's time for the bcc to start again
but this time reinstate all the blocked off drainage channels and
culverts that allowed drainage into lindum creek.

manual
of uniform traffic control devices
• design.
uniformity in design includes the selection of the appropriate sign
shape,colour, size, legend or symbol, and reflectorisation or
illumination if the sign hassignificance at night.•
application. it is essential to denote similar conditions with the
same device, or group ofdevices, so that road users can readily
anticipate the course of action required.to use a device in a
manner inconsistent with its use elsewhere is confusing
andconsequently creates a potentially hazardous situation.•
location. uniform location helps drivers to notice the device and
interpret the situationappropriately.

beware second dual gauge freight line
is planned to access fisherman islands port through brisbane's
eastern and southern suburbs.
when the existing dual gauge rail line
was built in most cases only back yards were resumed thus the noise
from the freight trains was even closer to residential homes.
we expect that the second dual gauge
rail line will require the resumption of most residential properties
on the northern / western side of the existing dual gauge line from
acacia ridge through to wynnum north.

why you may
ask?

they have no publicly available public
consultation policy document.

written
response

why do we want it?

so we can tell when they are not following
policy.

what is wrong with energex present
consultation?

their vision of consultation is to tell
you what they have decided to do to you and you most probably
have no chance in changing their decision.

we have a copy of the queensland labor
government policy document on consultation.

please e-mail us requests for a .pdf copy.

not allow prices to tell the economic truth. capitalism may collapse
because it does not allow prices to tell the ecological truth."

golf course in bulimba creek wetlands

on monday 3 feb 2003 the civic cabinet of the brisbane city
council (queensland labor party) approved a submission to build a new
golf course and 160 houses on bcc sport and recreation land at cannon
hill.
this land
adjoins conservation zoned land which is inhabited by australia most
dense colony of squirrel glider possums.
the land on
which the golf course is proposed is mainly a conservation grade
wetland / flood plain and much of the remaining land is covered by
tree canopy and is prime squirrel glider land.

many trees will be lost and any replanted trees will need to be at
least 200 years old to produce hollows which provide homes for
squirrel glider possums.
