          pj dick innovation fund project grant: (de)mass(ing) timber
      


we see this proposal as a seed grant to identify three pathways of tectonic/geometric strategies that can be further elaborated at full scale with future funding and industry partnerships. emerging technologies, such as ai-driven generative design and optimization, ar enhanced construction, and other computational processes will be essential to developing the work.
