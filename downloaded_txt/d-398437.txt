a tree falls in brooklyn



 hurricane irene was a smash. well... actually though this is not something to scoff at, especially for the car owner, irene was otherwise pretty uneventful for brooklyn. crown heights off of st. marks and bedford

frace: a little village called naves



carry me away to a dreamy little town where i awoke in my dream.this is naves. a sweet little town nestled in the mountains just outside of les vans but had you told me that i would have been treated  such grace and kindness that i experienced here, i'da laughed this is the lovely family that graciously welcomed me along on their vacation.  we swam in a river, climbed a mountain and roamed the country sides. i have never eaten so well in all my life.

a self portrait



i've been talking about going back to school for 6 years now. i guess i've been procrastinating do to the fear of failure, but also because i wasn't sure of what i wanted to do. i've been working as aa designer/art director in advertising for the past 10 years. putting together my portfolio for application was a wonderfully excruciating process. it took me 4 years find my voice and then another 2 years to create the pieces. long-story-short. i'm going to pratt institute for a mfa in sculpture with the objective to focus on public art.and i won't be coy, i am totally psyched. so i will be blogging about this journey for the next two years.

apt 2r: a virtual tour: 2



as you walk inand then to the left is my room.this area is still under construction but i was dying to show you the old window that will gave me as a house warming present. best gift ever!overall, i need a bit more color. i am not sure what that color is yet. i am digging the peacefulness of the neutrals though.  maybe something in the way of throw pillows for accents.
