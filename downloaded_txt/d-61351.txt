f.a.s.t. tab hull

                                patented and proven, crownline’s f.a.s.t. tab® hull design is one of the most efficient
                                and attractive hull designs on the market today, improving slow-speed stability,
                                time-to-plane acceleration and fuel economy.
                            

                                the acronym stands for fin-assisted safe turn. that’s the description. in practice, a
                                f.a.s.t tab hull’s vented chines aerate the running surface to reduce drag, and the
                                fin-like tabs keep those vents from producing handling quirks. the hull sticks in turns,
                                is responsive to trim, and really airs out at speed. chop back the throttle and you can
                                feel the vents working as the boat glides along for quite some distance before settling
                                off plane.
                            

                                there’s always positive control with the most unique sport boat hull system running
                                today.
