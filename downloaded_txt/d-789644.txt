we love music
are you struggling to engage your students in music? or are you an individual looking for better intuition? perhaps a tutor who makes music fun?
here at dotdismus, we love music. and a love like that cannot be forced, which is why we'd like to help all students experience music in the same natural and exciting way.
with our exhilarating range of music for schools, school children and students of all ages can receive the specific style of learning suited to their needs through our eclectic selection of theory books: piano, recorder, guitar, ukulele, violin, flute, trumpet and essentially any instrument you can imagine!
we also offer the biggest choice in the uk of primary school musicals, school plays and christmas musicals for children to perform.
perhaps the school production has been a bit of a shambles or a disappointment in the past. but children as young at 5 are bursting with talent, enthusiasm and the desire to really showcase their potential to a live audience. we acknowledge the incredible abilities of school children and do not belittle or underestimate the wondrous things they can do when given the right play to perform!
so, whether you are looking for a script, a tutor book or a songbook to put the whole thing together, we offer it all at dotdismus!
