 our story



we began manufacturing high end wooden exterior shutters in dallas, texas, when we were unable to locate a reasonable shutter source to service our customers. we found that the existing suppliers were too high priced, had long lead times, and overcharged for right-sizing and/or customization.our manufacturing process was created to produce “made to order” shutters that are the exact size needed without being “custom”.  this web site reflects an extension of this decades long philosophy.  our customers want high end shutters at a reasonable price. most people purchase from a short list of standard shutters, and should not have to go through an endless list of options (or learn a whole new vocabulary) to make a simple purchase. if you do need other style or size options for your shutters, contact us, and we will be happy to guide you through the ordering process.
