how to get a license on your 16th birthdaythe california dmv requires anyone under the age of 17 1/2 to hold a learners permit for at least 6 months prior to taking the behind the wheel driving test to get a driver's license. the dmv also does not allow you to get a learners permit until you are 15 1/2.the california dmv requires you to hold your learners permit for at least 6 months. therefore, you must prepare for, take, and pass your written test for your learners permit exactly 6 months ahead of time in order to be eligible for a driver's license test on the day that you turn 16.  if you do not pass your written test on the first try, then you will be delayed by one week, so study hard!
