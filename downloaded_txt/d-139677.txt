our approach
mutual learning approach. a mindset and set of behaviors that create three results: increased performance, stronger working relationships, and improved well-being. the essence: i understand some things, so do you, and our differences are opportunities for learning and increasing effectiveness.. 
psychological safety and trust are essential for productive results. we design all of our work with you so that people can safely say and hear what needs to be said and heard. 
systems approach. everything in a system—team or organization—is interconnected. we design and create change with the whole system in mind to reduce unintended negative consequences. 
joint design. we jointly design the work we do together. we have expertise and so do you. together, we are learning with and from each other, creating your desired results.

roger schwarz has hit the nail on the head. to bring positive long-term change and achieve the results you and your team are capable of, you can’t just change how you act; you need to fundamentally change how you think about your team.marshall goldsmithmillion selling author of mojo and what got you here won’t get you there
we used to make a decision and then change it because someone gave new information. it slowed us down. we’d been working on expensive development projects for multiple years but hadn’t finished them. mutual learning showed us that sharing all the information at once helped projects get done much faster. once we learned how well the principles worked, we were sold.kathy councilvice-president, sas publications division
through the mutual learning approach we have a group of leaders and employees who are designed to do our most critical work – in the new world today, not the way we used to do it.leamon bricetown manager, town of davidson, nc
