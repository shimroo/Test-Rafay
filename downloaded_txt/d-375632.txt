client testimonials






my fiancé and i booked pontarelli for our car service the night of our wedding. when we submitted a request for a quote, it came in very quickly via email and we got a call right away as well to discuss the event and all the details. we worked with michael h. specifically, and he was super helpful in making this an easy process and helping us cross this off our wedding to-do list. we will definitely be using them again- highly recommend!

pontarelli did an amazing job getting us and our family to and from ceremony and reception locations for our wedding in downtown chicago. ricky, our driver, swiftly got us to and from each location. the 38 person bus was comfortable. highly recommend pontarelli for any group transportation services!

lexi f.





this transportation company was a dream!! they were very organized and on time for every pick up and drop off for our wedding. at the end of the night, we still had many people who did not get on the last shuttle back to the hotel. the company was so understanding and made an extra pick up and drop off to accommodate for everyone. they went above and beyond for us and i cannot recommend them enough!!
