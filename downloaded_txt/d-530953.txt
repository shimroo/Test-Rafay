our core principles 








hear the truth
we hear with our ears, our minds, our hearts and our eyes.  we do not turn from truth, rather, we turn toward truth.   








live the truth
we live the truth as we apply the truth to our own lives.   to live the truth means it will make a difference, not only on the inside, but, on the outside too.   truth is not only heard, it is believed and lived out in tangible ways.  








tell the truth
we don’t keep truth to ourselves.  because it’s the truth it must be shared.  truth saves lives!  truth sets people free!  the opposite of truth is lies.  to tell the truth is loving! to lie is harmful & dangerous!  as the popular 1940’s through 1988  gameshow title reveals, its either “truth or consequences.”  while lies bring negative consequences, truth brings positive ones.  always tell the truth in love!

welcome 



welcome to the web-site of life matters now.  as our name states, we are about life. we are passionate about helping and saving lives.   we specifically seek to save, and improve all lives created in god’s image.  we are about the matters that are killing lives.   we seek to end abortion, end addiction, end euthanasia, and end suicide.  we believe that our culture is losing its respect for human life, and we want to restore belief in the inherent value of human beings.  we believe that life begins at conception, and that every human life is a sacred gift from god.while many pro-life organizations exist in our country, we see a need to bring communities, organizations, and issues together, so that we can better hear, live and tell the truth.  as a team of like-minded groups and individuals, we are united with common purpose and resolve.    we see great value in having so many specialized pro-life groups, and we honor their giftedness and their unique work.  it seems that those who support death are better organized, and better determined to work toward their goal of destruction.  those of us who are for life can do much better by purposely working with each other.  we have created a cohesive model that we believe will help mobilize communities and groups to become more proactive.  together we stand, but, we will do more than stand. together we will move forward. together we will saves and improve lives.  we are in a unique time in our country, one that i never thought i’d see in my lifetime.  i am continually amazed at the staggering numbers of innocent babies being killed in the womb; over 60 million since roe vs. wader.  i’m saddened by any death, including so many young folks, and veterans who are taking their own lives.  i’m sickened to see our elderly feeling hopeless and being told that dying is their better option. i’m deeply concerned that our citizens are becoming less and less compassionate toward those who suffer, and are putting such an emphasis on finances.   and i’m disheartened that drugs are killing people of all ages.we must work together to find solutions and to bring awareness to these issues.  that’s why life matters now has formed.   we recognize that life matters now.  the time to act is now.  we cannot afford to wait.  we hope that every community will form a chapter so that together we will help change our land from a culture of death to a culture of life.will you join us as we help save and improve lives?with hope and resolve in truthscott wiest, presidentlife matters now
