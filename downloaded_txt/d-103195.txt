yesterdays, todays & tomorrows


northwestern state normal campus
the castle on the hill
(burned to a shell of itself march, 1935)
a silent message thru the ages 
  is delivered to the races passing by, 
  and the wisdom of the sages 
  flashes futily from the sturdy eye, 
  watching life's laughter, song and tears 
  thru the eager march of onward years; 
  with quiet, unperturbed, mobile face 
  inspires us to live with equal grace. 
  [taken from the ranger 1926 yearbook]
