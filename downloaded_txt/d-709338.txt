the original australian pool sanitisation specialists
developing chemical free purification systems for pools since 1974...
aquamatics is a wholly owned australian business known for the manufacturing of swimming pool ionizer systems. for over 40 years aquamatics have researched, manufactured and distributed an alternative solution to sanitise swimming pools without the need for chlorine or other chemicals. today, our aquabrite system continues to stand as the best semi-automated pool sanitisation system in the world.ï»¿ï»¿it should come as no surprise that in the 21st century the modern ionic water purifier has been developed and refined to maximize the benefits of oligodynamics to water purification. aquamatics have spent the last 4 decades undertaking laboratory and field tests developing the aquabrite system to meet market needs. the aquabrite system combines the natural benefits of ionization and the aquabrite oxidizing agent to deliver a safe and effective fresh water disinfection system for your pool or water feature. the unique blend of dual acting oxidising agents accelerates the ionic process by activating the copper and silver ions in the water to kill algae and bacteria. this ionisation process uses natureâ€™s most effective algaecide (copper) and bactericide (silver) and through electrolysis the copper and silver change from solid electrodes to soluble ions dispersed in the water.ï»¿the most reliable swimming pool sanitisation system in australia. aquamatics offers guaranteed electrode composition of 95% of 99.9% pure copper and 5% of 99.9% pure silver. silver is for water safety and copper is for the elimination of algae growth. as one of the founders of the modern ionisation systems, we ask that before you buy from other manufacturers, ask them to provide guarantees as to the percentage of silver in their system.ï»¿ï»¿
