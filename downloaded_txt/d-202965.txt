woody's new years rulin's
woody guthrie's treasure trove of resolutions for the new year ahead.
woody wrote these heartfelt and playful resolutions on new yearâs day, 1943.

                        this little gem, in the middle of the book, provides insight into his daily concerns at the time â the large and the small â and reflect his hopes of being his best before the birth of their first child together, cathy ann guthrie. resolution #30 love pete refers to ârailroad pete,â the playful nickname woody and marjorie gave their unborn child.â

                        got a kick out of us, would’ve liked us, that we were somewhat kindred spirits so to speak, which to us was a huge honor.”

                        nora guthrie added, “i collected lyrics on all kinds of topicsâ¦lyrics that seemed to be needed to be said â or screamed â today. ken casey is
                        a master at understanding woody’s lyrics, which can be complicated, long, deadly serious, or totally ridiculous. dkm is capable of delivering
                        them all."

bob dylan once said, “you can listen to his songs and learn how to live”.
that line sums up what my life has evidenced. his songs, his art, his personal journal entries, his essays full of clear and
                            sometimes explosive ideas, have been there all my life teaching me how to live. these are the people he wanted me to know about, the history he
                            wanted me to learn. the love he wanted to express.
now it's time for me to put together my
                            selections from all these teachings thoughts on politics, on religion, on relationships, on children, and more. i want to give everyone a taste of
                            the teachings that benefited me most. ~ nora guthrie
