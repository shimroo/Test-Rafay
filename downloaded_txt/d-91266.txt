 western mystics, poets and religions

  and they allowed apollonius to ask questions;
  and he asked them of what they thought the cosmos was composed;
   but they replied:

  "of elements."

  "are there then four" he asked.

  "not four," said iarchas, "but five."

  "and how can there be a fifth," said apollonius,
"alongside of water and air and earth and fire ?"

  "there is the ether", replied the other,
  "which we must regard as the stuff of which gods are made;
   for just as all mortal creatures inhale tbe air,
   so do immortal and divine natures inhale the ether."

   apollonius again asked which was the first of the elements,
   and iarchas answered:

  "all are simultaneous, for a living
  creature is not born bit by bit."

  "am i," said apollonius, "to regard
   the universe as a living creature?"

  "yes," said the other, "if you have a sound knowledge of it,
   for it engenders all living things."

           "where but the moment before was only the wide desolation 
		   and invincible roar, is now a man, erect, full-statured, 
		   not-struggling frantically in that wild movement,
		   not buried and crushed and buffetted by those mighty monsters, 
		   but standing above them all, calm and superb, 
		   poised on the giddy summit, his feet buried in the churning foam, 
		   the salt smoke rising to his knees, 
		   and all the rest of him in the free air and flashing sunlight, 
		   and he is flying through the air, flying forward, 
		   flying fast as the surge on which he stands.
		   he is a mercury -- a brown mercury. his heels are winged,
		   and in them is the swiftness of the sea..."

original writings ...


     "just as the outer world of man has in it the terrestrial and the cosmic,
      so too the inner world of man has its terrestrial and cosmic environments.
      outwardly, the earth and sun and moon are bound in journey;
      inwardly, the heart and soul and mind are bound in journey.

      the metaphysics of life hides in the midst of natural simplicity.
