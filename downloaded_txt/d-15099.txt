overview :
mexico is a large country with regions which are very different
            from each other. the interior sections of mexico are full of beautiful
            mountain cities with spanish colonial architecture. these cities
            will range from large modern cities like monterrey and mexico city
            to quaint pueblos like san luis potosi and san miguel. virtually
            all of the inland destinations from mexico city and on south offer
            the addition of ruins from a once mighty civilization which rivaled
            the roman empire 2000 years ago.
beach destinations :
the mexican riviera hosts destinations including los cabos, mazatlan,
            puerto vallarta, manzanillo, ixtapa, acapulco and huatulco. each
            of these cities has a flavor distinct and different from each other.
            (see each of these destinations in our mexico guide to determine
            which city suites you best.)

mexico travel tips :
if you are on a budget, stick to the small colonial cities where
            backpackers and the like are able to travel for around $600 to $800
            usd per month. live like the locals whenever possible. that means
            that if you want to rent a place . . . do as the locals and search
            the streets for rent signs. it may also help to hire a local (pay
            them around $20 usd) to help you find a place. once established in
            affordable housing, spend your money in the mercado, visiting the
            local villages, attractions and beaches.
if you are only in mexico for a short time and want to see as much
            as possible . . . plan your main destination as the place you want
            to spend most of your time, and hit the road for a few days. you
            will find that the buss system in mexico far surpasses anything in
            the united states. it is cheap, clean, and even offers first class
            busses complete with air conditioning, comfortable airline style
          seats, and movies to help pass the time.
remember . . . mexico is not disney land. it is like any other country
            in the world, and tips like staying in well lit areas
            after dark where there are plenty of other people are just common
            sense.
