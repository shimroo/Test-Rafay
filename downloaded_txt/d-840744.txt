very good vet office!  “we are very happy with the care for both of our pets and appreciative of the covid precautions that were taken over the last two years. thank you!  brian k“it could not have been any better. dr coughlin always listens to my questions, and i have many, in a caring and professional way. the techs also carried josh to the car since he was falling. i would not take my dogs anywhere else.  robin l“it was an entirely satisfactory visit. i feel confident that silver maple will always provide top notch vet care for our cats.  dorian q“excellent job and great care especially in an emergency situation!!
