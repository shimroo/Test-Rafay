explore our catholic and dominican tradition 


in the catholic and dominican tradition, truth is not just a collection of unrelated propositions or disembodied ideas. it is an integrated way of life. we seek understanding not only for its own sake, but because we believe that the truth informs us about our place in the world and orients us towards that good life which all men and women desire.
