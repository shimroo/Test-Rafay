(you may still find it helpful to learn what the basic elements of html are, in case you need to insert a link in your site or see the code for your site). please note: i was not paid by any of the companies listed below to promote their sites. i did find it interesting to research what they have to offer and list some of the main points to consider. and yes, these are affiliate links but they have all been researched.  1. what is the cost of a website? many hosts can get you started for free! or with a very monthly rate for the 1st year. cost is usually listed as a âmonthly costâ provided you pay for a whole year at a time. ie: if the cost is $20.00 per month, you may be required to pay $240.00. make sure you get a plan that fits your needs. usually you can upgrade to a more expensive plan as your needs grow.  2. what is the platform the ecommerce site uses? generally, sites use either wordpress or what i call, a âhouseâ software. wordpress is in my experience a platform that requires an intermediate level of computer savvy. you will do better when you put some time into working with it and develop a âfeel for itâ. âhouseâ software is unique to the webhost site you are using. most are âplug and playâ. like any application, you just have to get comfortable moving around in them. each has some unique features. when you go to the webhost, you will see samples of web pages. when you like the look... go for it!  3. if you are going to be selling products through your site, you will need to know what bank does the ecommerce site use? this is extremely important. it is great you made a sale on your website, but how do you get the customerâs payment into your bank account? you want banking tools that your customer will feel comfortable ordering with, and you want banking tools that will give you access to your money. while many sites use paypal, some use other financial tools.  4. how many domains can i use on one account? if you have several domains, you will want to host them all in the same place. if you have different stores selling different products, you may want to use more than one site. ecommerce sites vary from one domain per account to âunlimitedâ domains.  5. what kind of stats will this ecommerce site provide? you may want to look around to see how much traffic you are getting and where people are seeing your site. (you may be surprised to note how many people in other countries are viewing your site).  6. how good is the technical support from this ecommerce site? you donât want to wait days for a question to be answered. a good test or response time is to ask the web host a question as âa potential clientâ to measure response time.  7. does this vendor sell domain names and for how much? and will they provide me with a free domain name with my order?  8. what is the difference between shared web hosting and a dedicated server?â the answer is, that a dedicated server is a server used by no other sites and thus those sites canât impact the server or slow it down. dedicated servers are quite a bit more expensive per month. most websites should be fine running on shared hosting. we will try to answer those questions. you can click on the link provided to get common website terms you should know: html: hypertext markup language. this is the actual programming code. no matter which programming tool you are using, whether it be wordpress  a sitebuilder, that interface is adjusting the html as you move and change features. css: cascading style sheets. this refers to how you website is presented in the programming. when you have purchased hosting and are ready to build a website on the hosting server, you must put your domain on that hosts server. you do this by putting in the code numbers for that server into your domain names. both the hosting provider and your domain seller will explain to you how to do this.  vps hosting: âvirtual private server hostingâ. vps hosting acts similar to a private server with more flexibility than shared hosting. most new users will only need shared hosting.  domain names: this is very important, when purchasing a domain name, pay little attention to the initial price of the domain name. what is important is the renewal cost. i have seen domain registers that charge very little for the initial price but upwards of $30.00 per year to renew. most paid hosting plans give you one free domain name with the purchase of a plan. beyond that, you will need to go to the market to buy additional names.  steven robert heine is a west coast poet & author. he has traveled extensively through the united states, including many trips to vermont. heine has spent his life promoting poetry; serving as founder for many poetry contests. he is the author of fifteen books, including poetry, history and his own short auto-biographies. his books can be found on ebay, amazon and amazon kindle. heine was crippled in a fall in 2011 and now makes very few public appearances.email
