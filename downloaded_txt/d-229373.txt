welcome to the new unitedtile.com

pages are easier to navigate, filter, and see all the tiles you want to see from each series.
you now have the ability to order online!
when logged in, your customer pricing will show on all items.
search has been drastically improved and you can order directly from the search results.
the inventory lookup tool has been changed to an inventory purchasing tool, allowing you to add items from the entire united tile inventory directly to your cart.
continued access to viewing open orders, paying invoices, and viewing payment receipts.



order shipping:
            currently, we are unable to ship regular items via fedex, the only option from the website is your default shipping method or ltl.
