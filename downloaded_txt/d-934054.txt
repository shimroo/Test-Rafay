anna got a new bike





anna got a new bike this week. her old one was a $10 garage sale purchase and was too small for her. we looked on craig's list and found a number of bikes that were more suitable in size, but i was uncomfortable paying $30-$40 for a used bike (for a 4 year old). i really liked the idea of anna earning the bike, but it would take a month or so to get enough stickers on her 'chore chart' to earn a bike.lydia was able to find one at meijer for $39.99 (which i still call under $40). it is very cute and she moves quite fast on it. we told her that he has to fill her sticker chart and this is her reward for chores and good behavior. is that teaching her to live off of credit, or is it just teaching her that sometimes parents are more gracious than they should be? i guess it is like god toward us- he is good to us; even when we are less than good!thus far she has been very appreciative for the bike. she can be so sweet.

new camera and watson pics and a video





prolegomena (it means 'first words'):we finally have a new camera (finally is too strong. our other one broke less than 2 weeks ago).it is an amazing story really. we were blessed with a good price from god's gracious hand. the short story is that the one i wanted was at costco. i looked on-line and could not find an uber-bargain. walmart had the same one for $100 more!i got it at costco and they only had the display model. so... we played bargain boy. i won. they gave me 20% off and extended the warranty for another year. blogging shall continue.for those in corry: please tell others who want to view loua (like stephanie and josh, etc) that they should send me an email and i will add them: nleshelman@gmail.comtoday's blog:here is a short video of watson crawling. he is getting super cute and now has 4 teeth.  there is no talking yet, but he is beginning to pull himself up onto things. that is fun to watch. pull up... tumble.red eye reduction off. oops.the hat is from scarlet stitch. it is actually one that was made for paige's baby, but he is not here yet, so watty can wear it.mama and watson downtown. we went to walk downtown, but the wind was so rough that we left after 5 minutes. we did get a good cup of coffee from beaners though. i had a cappuccino and lydia had a mocha latte.this hat is owen's. it is also from scarlet stitch. you really need to buy something from them, they are great!i think that he looks a lot like anna. anyone else?

april update: more to follow, promise





time is moving along so quickly. it seems like the transition from  winter to summer has come. i have plenty to d o to  finish my seminary training. i have some hebrew to finish and some  papers to write. there is so  much.  i will be working through the summer to get it all done. i hope that i manage.i have also been traveling a lot. this week is a coast-to-coast week. i was in los angeles last week and through monday. i got to preach at a great church there that is in between pasadena and burbank. very nice. the pacific is incredibly beautiful. tomorrow i fly out to georgia and will be on the east coast. i am looking forward to being there again.next month i will be in meadville pa and may get some time to swing north to see my parents. the same week i will be in carlisle pa for a conference. then later i will be in topeka, kansas.the gardening is going well so far. anna and owen both seem to be interested in horticulture. they have lots of questions about plants and flowers and, of course, want to pick everything that is in bloom! we planted a number of seeds this year in the house and have the kids caring for them. we may have 50 sunflowers this summer. it should be fun.well, i promise that there will be some photos coming soon. i really have not had time to do much of anything. the kids are great. watson is growing fast and attempting to crawl. it is cute. maybe i can get a youtube up of him crawling!off to finish my paper: who is this king of glory: an analysis of william symington's qualifications for jesus christ as mediatorial king as formulated in messiah the prince. sound exciting?

watty is all smiles





watson is getting so big! we cannot believe what being stuck in the house all winter can do. he has started getting out of that fat baby stage and heading towards the little toddler phase. of course, we all know he still is a baby- but he sure is growing fast!he has two teeth now which are really cute. he is also starting to creep on his own and sits up. he also is trying to crawl- knees up.. but it is in vain. he is not ready yet.here is a hat that tammy anderson of scarlet stitch made for anna. she thought that it would be cute to have her little brother wear it.i love the blue eyes with the blue pjs. he has great big eyes!here is a 'hey ladies!' smile.and a great big smile again! what a guy.we all love him quite a bit. it is hard to imagine that love grows in home- the more there are- the more to love!

first sun equals first trip to meijer gardens





we made our first trip to meijer gardens this week. we have had some beautiful sun and used the opportunity to get out and walk and enjoy the sculptures and the butterflies.we had a lot of fun with the meijers' family. we sat on their laps and tickled them and basically acted stupid.i thought i would tell fred thank you for all of the good times we have had there over the years.lydia and watson had a nice time too.watson, in his young life, does not realize how much time we will spend there this spring and summer. anna and owen know it- they call it 'the place they go with noah and seth'.i love the look on owen's face here. he adores his big sister.here he is in the tunnel. anna reminded me that we came here last year with justin and miss moes (it was on their anniversary i believe).i caught one of those butterflies. you are not supposed to; but he landed on my pants.here is lydia and owen at the 'grand rapids arch'.we look forward to many days at the gardens. we look forward to you all coming too!
