patrick terminals - sydney autorail

the patrick sydney autorail terminal is a phased development of a state of the art fully automated rail terminal that increases rail capacity at patrick terminals – sydney autostrad from 250,000 teu to over 1 million teu per annum when fully operational. phase 1 commences operation in early 2021 and phase 2 which will increase the rail siding length to 600 metres is scheduled for completion in 2023.
the new rail expansion project will improve rail turnaround times, whilst also providing increased rail services and windows. 1 million teu on rail reduces truck movements around the port by 900 per day which equates to an estimated decrease in co2 emissions of approximately 5,400 tonnes per annum with the use of rail versus trucks.
the new rail terminal provides direct access for importers and exporters to global markets and supports the intermodal network of sydney and regional new south wales.
