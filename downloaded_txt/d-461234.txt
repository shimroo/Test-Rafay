     the nativity historic preservation foundation grows from the realization that the beautiful and historic buildings that now house the episcopal church of the nativity have been handed down to us in a sacred trust from those who have come before. recognizing this incredible gift, we are called to be faithful and generous stewards of these buildings by offering our own financial resources to the work of preservation so that generations to come will know and perform the praiseworthy deeds of the lord that have been and will continue to be inspired through this holy place. 
 donations can be made to the nativity historic preservation foundation by mailing a check to:nativity historic preservation foundation 
208 eustis avenuehuntsville, al 35801 for more information on including the nativity historic preservation foundation in your will, please contact lou durnya at
