our heritage                        

harry adams started his practice in pretoria in 1908. by 1916 he was assisting the sa government in drafting new intellectual property law and had published a booklet on intellectual property laws in sa which brought international attention to his practice. the following year, harry was joined by his younger brother ev adams and so adams & adams was born. ev adams practised conveyancing and general law and this laid the foundation for adams & adams success as an intellectual property and commercial law firm. through the years adams & adams has continued the ground breaking and innovative spirit of the two brothers, no matter what the challenge.
