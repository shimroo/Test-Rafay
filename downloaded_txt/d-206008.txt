                                it's not as advanced as some other permanent deletion programs, it offers enough bonus
                                features to keep
                                you interested. the professional, welcoming look earns it a few extra points.

 simply deleting

                                formatting the disk, does nothing to stop a determined snoop. this program, a powerful
                                (and free!) set
                                of tools, promises to do something much more useful. ...... once the program has done
                                its job, there is
                                no turning back.

 we have been using

                                satisfy data wiping requirements at the university before disposing of old equipment. it
                                is very simple
                                to use so we are able to have workstudies wiping the drives. it does take several hours
                                on a 3 pass
                                wipe, but i don't think anything can be done about the time due to the nature of what
                                the software has
                                to do. it would be nice if there were audible or more obvious visual prompts that a wipe
                                has completed,
                                so the workstudy can see at a glance without looking at the small status window.

killdisk blog  



the gutmann method or do you really need to overwrite your drive
                        35x to be
                        safe?
august 8, by lsoft team


many of our novice or semi-advanced users of our software have asked us about the famous or infamous
                    gutmann
                    method and whether is it truly required for disks to be overwritten 35x for data to be securely
                    sanitized once
                    and for all? if you have read our blog on how to delete data you already know that us dod 5220.22-m
                    or any
                    other method that has 3 passes is good enough for data sanitation. however, since our killdisk does
                    support
                    gutmann we find that some explanation is necessary, otherwise âwhy put something there if you are
                    not using
                    it?â.
