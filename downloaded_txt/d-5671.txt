in august, we are open 6 days a week (closed on mondays) 
in september, we are open on tuesdays and wednesdays
 10.00am  - 4.00pm
 
after long consideration and careful thought, we have decided it�s time to close cobbaton combat collection as a tourist attraction.
      we will remain open to the public until the end of september 2024. thereafter, we will continue to host open days, militaria fairs and special events such as our vj weekend.
      this has been a monumental decision, and we will miss the familiar faces of our visitors. however, changes are necessary in order to move forward, and we will be focusing on the restoration of military vehicles, alongside events and other projects. 
      we hope to see you before the end of september. thank you for your continued support. 
      tim, beth, preston and dinie.
