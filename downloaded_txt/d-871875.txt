overweight:   here are some ways to check if your dog is overweight:  1 the rib rule  just right: feels like running your fingers over a keyboard too much: feels like pressing on a cushion   pro tip: use gentle pressure ‚Äì like petting, not pressing!    2 the hourglass test  just right: clear curve in from ribs to waist (like an ‚åõ) too much: straight or bulging sides (like a üü¶)   pro tip: look from above while your pup is standing    3 the profile view  just right: tummy tucks up behind ribs too much: straight or sagging belly line   pro tip: check while your dog is standing naturally    4 the energy check watch for these changes:  extra panting on regular walks choosing naps over play slower during usual activities less excited about exercise   5 physical changes keep an eye out for:  rounder, fuller face no visible waistline padding between back legs difficulty jumping into car less interest in walks or play   ‚ù§Ô∏è remember: this is about health, not shame every dog is different, and small changes can make a big difference!      close        why it is important to keep your dog at a healthy weight? excess weight can lead to the following:   arthritis weight puts pressure on joints, causing them to wear down faster. arthritis can also make dogs less likely to exercise, which can lead to a cycle of more eating, sleeping, and laying around.   respiratory problems excess fat in the chest can prevent the lungs from fully expanding, while fat in the abdomen can push up against the diaphragm. this makes it harder for the lungs to supply oxygen, especially when exercising.   skin conditions excess fat on your dog‚Äôs body can be a sign of being overweight. you can check for fat sacks between their legs or inspect their hips while petting them.   heart disease increased body fat can lead to higher blood pressure, which can cause congestive heart failure. the heart also has to work harder to pump blood to excess tissues.   diabetes obesity increases insulin resistance in dogs, which can lead to diabetes. diabetes is a serious health risk that requires ongoing treatment.   cancer studies suggest that obese dogs may have an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, including urinary bladder cancer and mammary tumors.   liver disease long-term obesity can lead to a fatty liver, which is a main cause of liver disease in dogs.   overall wellbeing simply put, your dog will feel better and be happier at a healthy weight. they are much less likely to suffer a premature death.   ‚ù§Ô∏è let‚Äôs help your dog feel their best! we do not want to starve them, feed them bland/boring food, or drain your wallet with a prescription diet. let us show you how you can feed a healthy, all-natural diet that will make them happy.      close        causes of weight gain in dogs  there are many reasons why a dog might gain weight, and you should check with your vet if you suspect any of these causes:  health issues cushing‚Äôs disease, hypothyroidism, intestinal parasites, or other health issues.   medication prescription medication may contribute to weight gain.   other factors fluid retention, hormone problems, pregnancy, or stress can also lead to weight gain in dogs.      close       food allergies in dogs occur when their immune system overreacts to specific ingredients in their diet, typically proteins such as chicken, beef, or fish. when a dog consumes a food they are allergic to, the immune system triggers an inflammatory response, which can result in various symptoms. in contrast, environmental allergies occur when a dog‚Äôs body reacts to allergens that come into contact with their skin, often absorbed through the paws or coat. these allergens include pollen, mold, dust mites, grasses, and even flea saliva. environmental allergies are most often seasonal, flaring up during particular times of the year, though they can also persist year-round, depending on the allergen.   dogs can develop allergies to any protein or carbohydrate they‚Äôve been exposed to, but the most common allergies are protein-specific.¬†when a dog eats food containing an allergen, their immune system attacks the protein as a foreign substance.¬†symptoms include skin issues like itching, redness, and swelling, and gastrointestinal issues like vomiting, diarrhea, and gas.¬†         some breeds are more likely to have food allergies, including the boxer, labrador retriever, pug, rhodesian ridgeback, and west highland white terrier. the german shepherd dog and golden retriever also have a higher rate of food allergies     it‚Äôs important to note that some dogs can suffer from both food and environmental allergies simultaneously. studies suggest that around 30% of dogs with food sensitivities also experience seasonal allergies or flea allergies, which can make diagnosis and treatment more complex.   close        causes of weight gain in dogs  ¬∑ there are many reasons why a dog might gain

    √ó        here are some ways to check if your dog is overweight:  ¬∑  feel their ribs you should be able to feel your dog‚Äôs ribs without a layer of fat covering them. if you can feel a thin

bulging in this area, they may be overweight. ¬∑ check their body condition from the side, your dog‚Äôs tummy should tuck up and their ribs should be just visible. ¬∑ look for fat pads excess fat on
