  google reviews
     google review—mwhere do i start? my girlfriend & i are complete shotgun novices. we arrived (following a ringing endorsement from a friend) and irene took us under her wing. what an amazing person, a credit to her profession. she walked us through the different type of guns, ammunition, how to carry everything correctly. she was patient, personable and just good fun. not only would i recommend her and this place to anyone to try, i already have!we'll be back!ps: training coordinator ron is another funny & amazing guy. organizing this from the very off was a breeze and so much fun...before we even got to the course!!


  google review—tci've been here a few times in the past couple years. it's addicting. this place is great for shooting guns. shotguns specifically. i like it a lot and the service is great. also the bbq is to die for. so delicious. go there. it's fun.


  google review—scgreat experience! we are first time learners and our instructor irene is awesome! she doesn’t just tell you to do this or that, she tells you why we do this and teaches you how to do it right. with her help i had some great shots.


  google review—jsthis place is awesome. it's in a private valley and is very beautiful. these setups for each shoot we're great. prices are reasonable. the family and our friends had a blast.just make sure to get there early. after 11am on the weekends it gets busy and you may have to wait at the stands. we got there before 9 and had no waiting before 11.


  google review—ghwhat a hidden playground. yes this place is so much fun. driving in golf carts shooting guns! it is like golf going hole to hole only you shoot with a shotgun. each station on the main course is different. there are traditional trap and skeet as well. a variety of areas to test your skills. you can rent guns, get snacks and drinks there even beer. so go and enjoy a day outdoors blasting away. bring a camera as well great sights to photograph.


  google review—nmjohn (trainer) made our valentine's day perfect! my man and i made a session with john for about 1.5 hours. john went through safety precautions, technique, and coached us through each step of the way. we appreciated how encouraging and patient john throughout our session. when we missed a shot, he gave us suggestions on where to keep our eye the next time or how we can improve. john is a great trainer! we highly recommend him for anyone new or even rusty on their aim trying to improve. you won't regret it!


  google review—jdwe went as a family as first timers and had a great time. the staff are friendly and the atmosphere relaxed. i'm sure they have plenty of good instructors but i can not emphasize enough how our particular instructor influenced our experience. she is personable, knowledgeable, patient and expert at spotting our mistakes. missed a target? irene had spotted the problem before i had pulled the trigger . some gentle advice and a little adjustment and "blam"! little bits of clay filled the sky. whether you are a novice or experienced you'll be a better shot by the end of the session. definitely, without a doubt, 100% - ask for irene!


  google review —dti have nothing but teriffic things to say about this place. it's like a high-end golf course for shooting clays. the people who run it are super friendly and the courses are both well laid out and maintained. great for beginners or well seasoned shooters.


  google review—dkcame here as a work trip and was my first time shooting. i was pleasantly surprised by the grounds and the equipment on the property.the staff was kind and helpful. the whole operation seemed to be very professionally run, and it was a world away from the hustle of the bay area. we had an instructor who was patient and calm, and who helped us learn to shoot and navigate the course. all in all, i'll definitely consider coming back if i have the urge to do some shooting again in the future.

  google review—jtwonderful people and a fun course! ron gave a lesson that helped me a lot and i'm decently experienced. enjoyed chatting with the owner about the genesis of the range, highly recommend the experience!


  google review—csgreat spot. nice rental guns. good nice workers. nice course, great area. 10/10.


  google review—hmgreat backdrop, nice staff, good place for team bonding, or crew experience. gun cleaning bench. food on weekends but if you bring food for after there’s a nice large oak to sit and have a sandwich n soda. highly recommend it!
