bamboo feeder asmr with three-year-old binx, our youngest aye-aye 🎋keeper lizzie made these lovely bamboo snacks for all of our aye-ayes by freezing diluted apple juice and peanut butter powder inside pieces of long leaf bamboo and adding a drizzle of honey before snack time. as binx demonstrates, the enrichment was a huge hit! binx does a great job of showing off some key aye-aye adaptations: the tapping finger to locate food and scoop it out, the rodent-style incisors that allow them to tear quickly through tough material like bamboo, and the power grip on their back feet that allows them to hang upside down 🙃➡️ lemur.duke.edu/wishlistwant to help our dedicated keepers make fun snacks for the lemurs? you can send food and other enrichment supplies directly to the dlc through our amazon wishlist! ✨🎥: abby flyer

there's no better cure for a case of the mondays than some cute photos of old man gratian 🤩gratian is currently the oldest coquerel's sifaka living at the duke lemur center. this 22-year-old male has been a huge contributor to the coquerel's sifaka species survival plan (ssp), with eleven offspring, eleven grandlemurs, and four great-grandlemurs, helping establish a genetic safety net for this critically endangered species in human care. his youngest daughter, pax (pictured with dad in the first photo), just turned one year old last month! you may have met gratian, pax, and current breeding partner magdalena on one of our wild workshops 💕📸: david haring

happy galentine's day! 💖lemurs are female dominant, meaning the ladies call the shots and sit at the top of the social hierarchy. while this can lead to competition for dominance between females within a group, it can also result in tight-knit relationships between related females. whether your galentine is a sister, mother, daughter, friend, cousin, partner, or any other important gal in your life, tag them in the comments to let them know you're thinking of them today (and to show them adorable lemur photos!) 🥰➡️ lemur.duke.edu/valentinewant to get your galentine something extra cute? donate $25 or more to lemur care and conservation to receive a link to our love and lemurs video valentine first thing tomorrow morning, which you'll be able to forward to your loved ones 💕📸: sara nicholson (1-3, 5); david haring (4)

did you know that many male lemur infants change fur color? 🤔in these throwback pics of blue-eyed black lemur mcavoy, you can see that the two-month-old infant still had a dusting of orange fur mixed in with his adult black coat. in sexually dichromatic species, all infants are born in the female color, ensuring that they're able to camouflage with mom's fur while clinging to her belly or back. around six weeks old, males will start to transition to their adult colors—though many juveniles end up with lingering orange patches for at least a few more weeks. mcavoy spent a couple of months with orange armpits before growing into his full coat of black fur! 🧡🖤📸: sara sorraia

alexa, play "soak up the sun" by sheryl crow 😎31-year-old licinius, the dlc's oldest ring-tailed lemur, loves to sunbathe on warm days. unfortunately, it's a little too cold for our lemurs to be outside right now, so we're stuck reminiscing on warm summer days from indoors ☀️fun fact: licinius is one of the ring-tailed lemurs featured in this year's love and lemurs video valentine! receive the link to this adorable video to enjoy for yourself or send to loved ones by donating $25 or more to support lemur care and conservation at lemur.duke.edu/valentine 💕📸: allie monahan

2 commentscomment on facebookordered mine! i put a message in the order that you need to email the promo. i don't like clicking through links on fb, but because the lemurs and staff mean so much to me, i did. can't wait for video!this year around the facebook algorithm has not shown me any of your recent posts. just this morning i thought of lemurs, which sparked my memory of the adorable valentines gift deal you offer for the occasion usually. so i rushed to make my donation just now ❤️

happy #madagascarmonday! here's a video discussing some of the forest management our team is working on in the sava region 🌱forests are vital to global ecosystems, but they're disappearing worldwide—with negative consequences for biodiversity and people. people need forests for building materials, firewood, charcoal, food, and medicine. the mountain ambanitaza is the source of the sacred waterfalls which people visit every week to pray 🏔the forest and its waters also support the farmlands all around, which is why the communities around ambanitaza came together to create a grassroots forest management association. over the last four years, the dlc has supported the association to plant almost 100k trees, as well as organize meetings with all community members and environmental authorities on forest management regulations 🪴the dlc's conservation projects in madagascar are run exclusively on grants and donations. you can support our work today at lemur.duke.edu/donate 💚to learn more about conservation projects like this, visit lemur.duke.edu/conservation or keep an eye out for upcoming #madagascarmonday updates! ✨🎥: james herrera and riccardo morrelas
