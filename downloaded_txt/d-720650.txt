dear stick and go,

these tiles are absolutely wonderful, they look like the real thing and we have fooled all are friends into thinking we are now experts at tiling! the only skill needed was being able to cut straight with a pair of scissors. the whole of our kitchen was done in under a day and the results you can see for yourself. all in all a brilliant product.
