discover the magic and beauty of handmade lampwork glass beads! little works of art to be worn, collected, treasured and admired. each bead is handmade by me, pam brisse, in my garden studio in edmonds, washington. never the same bead twice, each one a unique mixture of glass, heat, gravity and sometimes, pure luck. inspired by the four elements: earth, air, fire and water and infused with the fifth element: love. use these beads to design your own one-of-a-kind jewelry piece or request a pendant or other wearable art item to be created especially for you.
