how we work to make a difference











emergencies
we pushed for peace in yemen and the repatriation of children trapped in syria, and we are working to help those affected by the gaza crisis as well as the east africa food crisis. 
our beirut explosion response was set up to provide immediate support through our emergency fund (read more about the fund here).
whether children are at risk due to conflict, natural disasters or the global food crisis we ensure we’re there providing all we can to ease their suffering and help recovery. 
take a look at the work we did with donations for our cyclone idai appeal. 







around the world
as a children's rights charity, the movement operates in 115 countries, providing unique care to children based on their specific needs.
whether vaccinating children in remote regions, providing antibiotics for pneumonia treatment, setting up learning centres after disasters, or working to bring british children home from syria, we do all we can to support them.
as covid turned lives upside down, we provided medical supplies, helped thousands of households with access to clean water and soap and worked with 2.9m children on distance learning.







our uk work
we work in homes, nurseries, schools and communities to narrow the gap between children living in poverty and their better off classmates.

when covid hit, uk children's lives were turned upside down. to help, we started an emergency grant for the worst-affected families. so far it has helped over 10,000 of britain's poorest children with early-learning packs, food vouchers, and other essentials.
we are proud of the work we've done in the uk, but recognise we have a long way to go.
find out the shocking stats of how poverty can affect learning and read more about our work to combat this here.











how you can help children now
 





there are so many ways your charity donation can support save the children. you can give to our emergency fund which goes to where the need is greatest at that time or you could learn about the benefits of monthly donations to charity. you can give in memory to celebrate the life of a loved one, or leave a gift in a will to help us continue to deliver life-changing work. you can also give just to our uk work or learn more about our fundraising ideas and fundraising charity events that way.
you could make a donation of unwanted clothes, books, bric-a-brac, toys, music and films to one of our many save the children charity shops, or even pop in to one to find something that takes your fancy. we also have our mary’s living and giving shops, set up with retail expert mary portas, these boutique shops ensure you’ll find something beautiful, whilst also supporting our work.
want to give your time instead? check out our latest petitions, and sign your name to support our cause. you can also volunteer at one of our shops across the uk, and give you time to help us keep our shops open and raise money for children.
