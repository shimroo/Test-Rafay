welcome to training for change!


training for change is a training and capacity building organization for activists and organizers. we believe strong training and group facilitation is vital to movement building for social justice and radical change.
since 1992, we’ve supported groups taking direct action, building strong teams and organizations, and working at the grassroots. we train thousands of people each year in north america, and also internationally, across issues and sectors – from campaign strategy retreats for anti-gentrification community groups, facilitation training for union leaders, to de-escalation skills for immigrant rights groups resisting deportation.













our direct education approach

we’re dedicated to transformation – beyond training new skills and tools, we support folks to wage conflict, challenge self-limiting beliefs, practice emotional intelligence, and expand what’s possible for them and their groups. we believe training is most effective when it builds on the wisdom of people’s lived experience. our participant-centered practice follows emerging group dynamics in a workshop, adapts to local cultures and theories of change, and is oriented toward action – we call it direct education.
