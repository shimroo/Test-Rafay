book nook:  #presidential age and #intelligence.  #executivefunctions and the #executive office





talk about timely…given all the talk about the age of our current (trump) and prior (biden) presidents.  about this book (from publisher web page)this book on presidential age is not about alzheimer's disease and associated pathologies of the aging brain. it is instead about the normally aging brain. brains don’t simply develop and maintain their functionality into older adulthood unless otherwise impaired by neurocognitive disease. were this the case, this book might be about leveraging prodromal biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases to screen prospective presidential candidates. instead, the normal decline age brings to all human brains begs a different type of book—and a broader and more blanketed warning about electing increasingly older presidents.table of contents below.  it is clear from the breadth of coverage that this is a serious attempt to corral critical age-related cognitive abilities research in the context of executive decision making (e.g., being president)…which makes it clear that the assessment of intelligence is well beyond the quick and very limited moca screener that our current president likes to brag (incorrectly) about as an indication of his great intelligence.  the book is due out the first week of march, 2025.  thus, i have not read any of the chapters upon which to base an opinion.  i shall be ordering a copy.click on images to enlarge for easy reading.

new journal in intelligence:  #intelligence and #cognitive #abilities





passing this long to professionals interested in intelligence and cognitive abilities research.dear colleagues and friends,intelligence & cognitive abilities (ica) is up and running and ready for submissions! this has happened in record time thanks to support, encouragement, and input from many people, especially those who helped fund us. we’re also thrilled to announce that anna-lena schubert and tim bates have agreed to be associate editors.since elsevier’s intelligence has a “new” direction (and most of their eb resigned in protest), ica was created to ensure intelligence researchers have a publication outlet edited by individuals with strong track records of intelligence research and committed to free inquiry. moreover, to maximize the availability of every published paper, ica is entirely online and open access. because profit is not a primary motivating factor, the publication fee is substantially lower than all other journals that cover this area of psychology (at least by 50%). since many intelligence researchers do not have funding for publication costs, ica offers generous waivers and discounts. the editorial board represents expertise for the full, diverse range of intelligence topics, research designs, and data analysis methods.but wait. there’s more. to encourage submissions, any manuscripts submitted before september 1st, 2025 and subsequently accepted will have all publication charges waived.ica is hosted on the scholastica journal publishing platform. here is a link for official ica information including aims and scope, editorial board, and what authors need to know for preparing and submitting manuscripts: icajournal.scholasticahq.com (see tabs on upper left; this site will be evolving visually and adding functionally over the next few weeks but it already supports all aspects of submission, review, and publication). any email invitations you receive inviting reviews of submissions and other simple site registration will come from scholastica.intelligence research has moved far beyond traditional psychometrics into cognitive psychology, genetics, neuroimaging, neuroscience, and many other domains. all perspectives are welcomed to publish in ica. we pledge fair and constructive reviews by experts and speedy online publication. but to be successful and serve the intelligence research community, we need submissions so please consider clicking the link above with your best work as soon as possible. it’s now up to you.with gratitude,sincerely,tom coyle, editor-in-chiefrich haier, consulting editor

research byte:  using decoding measures to identify #readingdifficulties: a #metaanalysis on english as a first language learners and english language learners #ell #el1





using decoding measures to identify reading difficulties: a meta-analysis on english as a first language learners and english language learnersclick here to view at journal of educational psychologystudents with or at risk of reading difficulties (rd) benefit from accurate early identification and intervention. previous research has employed various decoding measures to screen students for rd, but the criteria for identification have been inconsistent. assessing students with rd is especially challenging in english language learners (ells), as vocabulary deficits can impact decoding. additionally, few research syntheses have examined whether researchers use different measures to screen ells and el1s for rd, and whether these differences result in distinct decoding profiles between ells with rd and el1s with rd. to address these gaps, this study uses a meta-analysis to examine the decoding measures used in rd assessments and whether outcomes differ for ells and el1s. the findings show that real word reading assessments identify students with more pronounced decoding deficits than nonword reading assessments. despite the use of different rd screening measures for ells and el1s, the gap between ells with and without rd was similar to that between el1s with and without rd. these results suggest that real word-reliant measures, which are influenced by word knowledge, provide a more comprehensive assessment of rd than nonword-reliant measures for both ells and el1s. we encourage future researchers to use consistent decoding measures when screening rd in both populations, to maximize comparability of findings.

research byte:  individual differences in #workingmemory (gwm) and #attentionalcontrol (#ac) continue to predict memory #gl) performance despite extensive learning—#chc #schoolpsychology





individual differences in working memory and attentional control continue to predict memory performance despite extensive learning.zhao, c., & vogel, e. k. (2025). individual differences in working memory and attentional control continue to predict memory performance despite extensive learning. journal of experimental psychology: general. advance online publication. https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001728abstractindividual differences in working memory predict a wide range of cognitive abilities. however, little research has been done on whether working memory continues to predict task performance after repetitive learning. here, we tested whether working memory ability continued to predict long-term memory (ltm) performance for picture sequences even after participants showed massive learning. in experiments 1–3, subjects performed a source memory task in which they were presented a sequence of 30 objects shown in one of four quadrants and then were tested on each item’s position. we repeated this procedure for five times in experiment 1 and 12 times in experiments 2 and 3. interestingly, we discovered that individual differences in working memory continually predicted ltm accuracy across all repetitions. in experiment 4, we replicated the stable working memory demands with word pairs. in experiment 5, we generalized the stable working memory demands model to attentional control abilities. together, these results suggest that people, instead of relying less on working memory, optimized their working memory and attentional control throughout learning. impact statementworking memory ability predicts various cognitive abilities. however, whether its predictive power remains after participants repetitively study the test materials remains unknown. here, in five experiments with visual and verbal materials, we found that individual differences in working memory and attentional control (wmac) constantly predicted people’s memory performance even after extensive training of the same materials. our results provided a new understanding of wmac, in that learning may better tune participants’ attention and working memory toward task demands, instead of eliminating the reliance on attentional control in performing tasks.
