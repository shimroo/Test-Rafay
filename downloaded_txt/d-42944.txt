parents' choice























in honor of the hard working team at parents’ choice, we salute you! may another door open as this one closes.  we closed our doors on july 31, 2022.


in 1978 diana huss green, mother and children’s book author, sensed a need. parents were looking for guidance on children’s books and toys. they wanted to read beyond the hype and learn which products would be best for their children.
from the start, the mission was clear: to search out and recommend books and toys that help kids grow – imaginatively, physically, morally and mentally; fairly-priced products that are fun, safe and socially sound.
a hard-working grass roots army was formed to help test, review and critique. children’s book authors, illustrators and critics. musicians and storytellers, doctors, educators, librarians, scientists and engineers. parents’ choice foundation was established as a 501c3 in march 1978. within a few years the parents’ choice awards® list was shaping librarians’ purchases and toy store offerings. parents’ choice foundation soon earned the respect of parents, publishers, newsmakers and industry leaders.
parents’ choice foundation was first to create a program to recognize and celebrate quality children’s media and toys.
