introducing
"the mat"

 after some hiatus period, boston audio has teamed up with sakura systems and now proudly introduces "the mat", the culmination of our experiences through developping mat 1 & 2. by incorporating different carbon graphite material, we successfully achieved the identical performance of mat 2 with less thickness (4 mm) and the reduced price.
