100,000+ people chose passport. here’s why.














this dealership is by far the best in the omv area because of their impeccable customer service. my husband and i were shopping around for a some time and a friend recommended this spot.
from start to finish, our experience was phenomenal with them - front desk, to the financing part, receipt of the vehicle, and everything in between.















if you want an excellent, professional, low pressure automobile buying experience passport bmw is the p lace and greg chery is the salesman. we got just the car we wanted and are very happy with the experience and the great vehicle!















passport bmw was just exceptional. the help from mr. zach haynes & mr. ken brokaw in services were perfect. although they're busy 24.7 with multiple customers and calls, they didn't let that overwhelm them and actually cared about what i requested on my bmw. those 2 treated me with respect and stayed on top of my car, providing me with updates. the parts department was amazing, the cafeteria was actually great and surprisingly cheap.















this dealership is so welcoming and kind to any customers they have! i came here looking to buy a used car and that’s exactly what i did! they made sure i was content and always asked if i needed anything. if you are looking to buy a car i would suggest passport toyota. 100% would come here again and i would suggest everyone else to! amazing dealership!















passport toyota is the best car dealership that i have done business with since i started buying cars. i had the same experience with passport bmw as well. it is clear that the culture the company leadership and management have created is felt throughout the whole buying experience. they are focused on building long term clients relationships. their customer service is second to none. i have bought at least 6 cars over the years.















i have been working with passport for almost a decade and have bought several cars from them. they make the entire car buying process extremely efficient and i have nothing but praise on how they operate. most importantly they stand by their product and the customer service and after purchase care is second to none. passport toyota builds relationships and earns customers for life. i would never go elsewhere.















i had an amazing experience at this dealership. i know there’s a stigma about dealerships and car salespeople but at this dealership it is a completely different experience. definitely try them out you won’t regret it, i wish every dealership was like this one.















i definitely give this dealership 5 stars! this is the second vehicle that i have gotten from here and both times i was assisted by carlos and andre who made my experience very pleasurable and memorable. today i honestly came for an oil change and ended up trading my truck out for 2023 mazda cx-5, which was an upgraded version of the truck i had. carlos and andre are awesome and they always seem to work miracles. they will forever have my business.
