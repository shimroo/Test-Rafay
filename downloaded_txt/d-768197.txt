an authentic taste of andalucia

amada is chef garces' iconic first restaurant. since opening in 2005, the gorgeous rustic-chic restaurant and bar has embraced the rich traditions of spanish cuisine. amada's capacious dining room features a six-seat chef's counter overlooking the open kitchen, a comfortable second dining room and lounge area, an intimate private event space and a spacious bar area reminiscent of a typical spanish bodega, complete with hanging jamons.












"philadelphia had every type of restaurant and cuisine, except authentic spanish tapas. amada allowed me to grow creatively and it filled a major void in the city's dining scene."

chef jose garces
