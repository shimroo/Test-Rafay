tattoos against cancer
each year in the fall we host our tattoos against cancer benefit. over the last 9 years of events we have raised over $73,000 for meghan's mountain, a local charity that supports quality of life issues for children dealing with cancer. over the last few years camp quality, indian summer camp, and the children at norton children's hospital going through cancer treatment.sadly, in january of 2016 meghan lost her battle with cancer. her legacy of helping others will live on through her foundation and  all of those whose lives she touched.it takes a lot of work and effort to put this event on each year and we love every minute of it. the artists here all donate their time and skill for the day, the business donates all of the supplies, and you all donate your money all for a wonderful cause. it is an honor to be able to give back to our community in such a meaningful way.each year we work to make our event better than the previous one, keep an eye on our facebook pages for details as fall rolls around each year!

about
voted number one tattoo studio in louisville 2012-2024 and top 3 in piercing for the same 12 years. whether you want a portrait, fine line, realism, traditional, or any other style of tattooing we have an artist to fit your needs. we love doing everything from the smallest piece to full back pieces! custom work is our specialty and we are always happy to work off of a design you bring in.all of our piercers are members of the association of professional piercers and uphold a high standard of safety. we use only american made quality jewelry, never imported costume jewelry like you’d find at a mall retailer.we use internally threaded jewelry for your safety and comfort with all of our piercings. external threads tear the tissue causing extra pain, excessive scar tissue, and slower healing. internal threads go in smoothly causing less pain, less damage to the skin, and promote faster healing. quality jewelry matters.please browse our artist portfolios and facebook page for examples of the quality we offer.we want to earn your business, stop in and talk to a professional artist or piercer today! if you have a design or just an idea come in and we can make it a reality -while -u- wait!
