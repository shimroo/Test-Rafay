discovery education is my go-to tool, i love having the ability to look up standards associated with the lessons. de helps me create fun interactive lessons that show students how something is done or made and how it applies to our everyday lives. i have always been focused on increasing my worldly knowledge and with de, i am able to do this. through de, the world is at our fingertips.

de is a perfect match to our district goal for ‘high-quality challenging education that instills character and enables students to compete successfully’. from the prek videos, interactive labs, and the extensive partner programs, there is something for everyone. i especially like the pd opportunities for teachers.

discovery education has allowed my students to work on lessons they would otherwise not have access to. our recent lesson was about how molecules move within solids, liquids, and gases, and the students were amazed with the interactive activity from discovery education. they were able to comprehend what we were talking about in our class and now have applied it to real life situations. i would not have been able to be successful in this lesson if it wasn’t for the help of discovery education
