podcast
gallo vault sessions

gallo vault sessions podcast is a 6-part series brought to you by gallo music in collaboration with konjo. we delve into the story of gallo music, africa’s largest and oldest recording company, and reflect on the ways music shapes culture, and how our culture has been shaped by music…both at the centre and periphery of africa’s music history. we bridge 95 years of gallo’s music history with konjo’s passion for cultural storytelling and chat with artists, label executives, radio veterans and music thinkers as we explore the undercurrents, backstories and overlooked tapes from the gallo vault; from mbaqanga to soul, and also, provide you with a curated playlist to soundtrack each month.
