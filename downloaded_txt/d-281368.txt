a new candidate for atil's location has emerged! it's semibugry, a large khazar-era city that was discovered 
in 2019 by researchers from astrakhan, including damir solovyov. 
they continued to dig in the summers of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.
i added what we know so far about semibugry's remains to my atil page.











medieval kingdom of khazaria, 652-969



over a thousand years ago, the far east of europe was ruled by jewish
kings who presided over numerous tribes, including their own tribe: the 
turkic khazars.  after their conversion, the khazar people used jewish
personal names, spoke and wrote in hebrew, 
were circumcised, had synagogues and rabbis, studied the torah and talmud,
and observed hanukkah, pesach, and the sabbath.
the khazars were an advanced
civilization with one of the most tolerant societies of the medieval
period.  it hosted merchants from all over asia and europe.  on these
pages it is hoped that you may learn more about this fascinating culture.

descendants of the khazars in europe




what happened to the khazars after the fall of their kingdom?
this remains one of the most controversial questions in khazar 
studies. some new answers emerged from new discoveries. 
the first essay summarizes evidence and opinions surrounding the issue.
the second essay
explains how we know that eastern european jews descend from
non-khazar jews. the third page gathers available evidence on 
genetics and shows that ashkenazic jews have substantial roots in the 
middle east
as well as some ancestry from italy,
southern china, north africa, and the slavic lands.
the fourth page queries whether jews who live in the 
caucasus today descend from khazar converts.

jews descended from the khazars?

    from 1120 to 1140, ha-levi wrote the famous 5-chapter book known as
    the kuzari, which bases its storyline upon the khazars' conversion to 
    judaism.

"the khazars originated from the distant east... in the seventh and eighth centuries, this new empire halted arab expansionism, 
established contact with byzantium, and became a decisive force between the caspian sea and the river don up to the middle 
of the tenth century. land cultivation, animal husbandry and handicrafts flourished in the empire. merchants traded not only 
with byzantium, but also with the arab-persian world and the distant east. the kagans did not prohibit the activities of christian 
and moslem missionaries. both religions maintained places or worship and schools on khazar land. out of political considerations, 
however, the kagans and their retinues embraced a third great monotheist religion, judaism."
- the magyars: the birth of a european nation
by györgy balázs, page 8.

"the khaganate of the khazars was of the upmost strategic importance for the
byzantines for several reasons. first of all, it controlled the routes to the 
southern caucasus, thus playing a central role in the geopolitics of the area. 
... secondly, the byzantine possessions in crimea... were bordered by the 
khazars, who represented a major piece in the puzzle of nations who competed 
for domination of the region. ... finally, the khazar empire lay at a crossing 
of trading routes linking the russian steppes with central asia..."
- the emperor theophilos and the east, 829-842
by juan signes codoñer, "section v: the khazar flank", page 335.
