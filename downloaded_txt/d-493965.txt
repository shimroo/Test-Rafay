head golf pro: 2025 golf equipment review
every year golf club manufacturers reengineer their golf clubs with new technology designed to help you hit the ball longer and straighter.  2025 is no different as everybody has something new.  i’ve been talking to our sales reps and have the lowdown on what new things will be available this spring.  if you want to add a few new items to the bag, this article is worth reading to get unbiased information about all the new equipment offered.  i would also like to point out that western lakes will be hosting fitting days both indoors and outdoors this spring, keep your eyes on your emails for dates.  all clubs mentioned are available at western lakes and at the best prices in town.   custom orders are welcome at no additional charge.  please contact us at 262-691-0900 ext 6, or gmack@western lakes.com with any equipment questions.
