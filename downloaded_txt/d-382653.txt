client reviews 










						thank you to the team for all the services culinary specialties provide with quality products and fast service in an unpredictable and changing  culinary environment. truly 5 star service  in our eyes.					


banquet chef dennis cortezfairmont grand del mar 






						i have worked with culinary specialties for a number of years at various properties and they have always delivered. their quality and attention to detail is spot on and why i continue to use them and bring them in wherever i go. whatever i need they always do the best to get it to me and are always available if i have any questions.					


executive chef david wimberlymarriott la jolla 






						i have had a partnership with culinary specialties since 2008.
i have utilized culinary specialties for all of my customized appetizer and specialty plated vegetarian/vegan entrée selections since that time.
culinary and i have worked as a collaborative unit to execute my vision flawlessly and continue to work together to provide my guests with great offerings every day.
i would recommend culinary as a specialty vendor to anyone in the industry as their quality is far above what the other appetizer companies sell and their “traditional” offerings are always of a higher caliber than other vendors.
