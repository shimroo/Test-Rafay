you and your mac
we know how horrible it feels having malicious software take over your computer, hold your files to ransom, or steal your data.
we also know how painful it is when traditional antivirus solutions are almost as bad as the problems they're trying to solve - making your computer slow, or even selling your browsing history!
clamxav is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use. and we will never sell your data.
unleash your mac! let clamxav protect it without slowing it down.
