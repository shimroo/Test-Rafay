q- how much does a 10'x12' mural cost?a- the size doesn't really determine the price. it's actually the amount of detail.sky and clouds costs less than the last supper... q- what does an average mural cost?a- my murals are not average but start around $20,000. q- i don't want to spend the money in case we decide to move.a- i usually paint on canvas, so you can take the mural with you if you move and reinstall it a new home. i personally install all murals myself by gluing it to the wall or ceiling. usually takes only one day. no special preparation is needed. q- i don't know what i want.a- creating a mural for your home can be great fun. as the client, you are commissioning a one of a kind piece of art. i generally start with three ideas for the space, all quite different from each other with three levels of pricing. then we can start to narrow it down to a final sketch. q- what if i don't like it when it's done?a.- won't happen because you are involved during the whole process. i email picture updates and can have zoom conference into the studio if you wish. i will not just show up with a finished mural and hope you like it. q- where are you located?a- i currently live in the new york city metropolitan area but have traveled as far as egypt for a gig. my murals can be rolled and shipped anywhere you like.  give me a ring or drop me an email if you have any other questions.
