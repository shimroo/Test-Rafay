ozspy – the original spy shopback when we first opened in 1998 there were no mass produced spy cameras, so we used to make them (and we still do). we have always believed quality security cameras and surveillance equipment should be available to everyone, which is why we were the first in australia to sell spy gear and a full range of diy home security cameras and alarm systems.
smart technology
over the decades we have helped over 100,000 aussies improve their security with advanced smart security tech.

outstanding support
with so many clients, we have had to nail our support, which is why we have our own support techs ready to help.

secure checkout
with 128-bit ssl security with advanced encryption you are guaranteed that your purchases are safe.testimonialsiâm a small business in the local area and urgently needed required surveillance in the office area. he was able to come out quickly and install several cameras in a very covert operation. he was very understanding, professional and expeditious with my request. the installation of these cameras helped identify a very serious staff transgression and consequently saved thousands of dollars in future earnings. the cameras also allow me to log in and sight any problems or issues from home on my ipad giving me peace of mind. i would highly recommend ozspy loganholme to any future customers.
sue
we purchased a home security  camera package from ozspy security solutions, shailer park qld. a truly amazing company to deal with. nothing was too much trouble and their communications during the lead up to the installation were outstanding. craig and brooke are very professional when dealing with customers. everything was explained in detail and the follow up was greatly appreciated. andrew did the install and we were very impressed with his thinking outside the box and also he was very neat and tidy. we are very happy customers and we would have no hesitation in recommending ozspy security solutions for all of your security problems.
beryl jthe best security system brandswe pick the very best security system brands like hikvision, dahua, vip, bosch, so you can be assured of quality, as there can be no compromises when it comes to our clients safety and security. we also have access to all the other common brands of security cameras and alarm systems.
