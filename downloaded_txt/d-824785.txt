what our customers think 

“i have been using tri nature exclusively in my home since my 18-year-old was a baby. as such a sensitive little person, it was clear that i needed to do away with harsh washing and cleaning products – that’s when i discovered tri nature. from the dishwashing liquid and laundry powder to carpet cleaning and pet shampoo, i have always been extremely satisfied with all of their products. not to mention, tri nature is super economical … i only need to order a few times a year because you need such small portions to get the job done.”
- madonna 



“i love tri nature products. they work. my favourite, apart from the essential oils which are top quality, is the sphagnum moss disinfectant. oh – well – now that i think about it, i love the bbq cleaner too. it works great on the oven, and glass cooktop. then there’s the shampoo and conditioner – i could go on. suffice to say, the products i’ve used haven’t let me down.”
- jodie 



“tri nature laundry products have really exceeded my expectations. my interest was sparked being an australian brand and it turns out it is also great value for money. the laundry powder not only cleans well and smells lovely it is also grey water friendly. i have also recently purchased the room spray which smells lovely.”
- j 



“great quality products. i have been using tri nature for nearly 30 years. their dishwashing liquid, laundry detergent, disinfectant, and furniture polish are my absolute favourites. give tri nature a try, you won’t be disappointed.”
- taylor 



“tri nature products far exceeded my expectation. they are grey water friendly which in my experience usually means a compromise on cleaning ability, not the case with tri nature! i’ve found their laundry powder so effective that i use just half of the recommended dose per wash. great value for money.”
- simon 



“the laundry powder is brilliant.  i started using it years ago when my son was quite young and suffered from eczema.  his skin cleared up after using the tri nature washing powder exclusively.  just recently he moved out (which goes to show how long i have been using the product) and switched to a supermarket brand.  within about 2 weeks he rang me up and asked me if he could have some of the tri nature laundry powder as he could feel his skin becoming itchy and irritated again. it is not only kind on the environment it is kind on humans too and it does a great job cleaning in the process.”
- helen
