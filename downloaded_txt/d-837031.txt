we walked in song



now on vinyl
































geranium lake














geranium lake is a collection of live performances, demos, and unreleased songs from the glow tours and home recordings leading up to making our 1995 album glow.the name geranium lake is borrowed from the tint of red paint to suggest a place, and the song has to do with returning to a beloved place in the memory. an early version of this song was a b-side on the bright as yellow single. the demos have  been re- sung in 2022, but are otherwise original band recordings from our former keppel building, lancaster pa rehearsal space, and all concert recordings are from 1996 and are unchanged.
