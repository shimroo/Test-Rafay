  in 1958 three brothers: jerry, alden, and court boice started the first american commercial jet boat tour company, jerry’s rogue jets. they revolutionized commercial boating by developing a hydro-jet boat engine which allowed the boats to travel at high speeds up the shallow rocky waters of the wild & scenic rogue river. jerry’s rogue jets set the standard for commercial jet boat tours, and proudly continues this legacy on to this day.🚤🌊

  "wow! awesome trip! we went on the wilderness tour (longest one) and had such a great time! brandon was our skipper and did a great job navigating the rapids and providing numerous 360 degree spins. highly recommend this if you're in the area. we did not come here to do this, just to relax for a few days in the rv, but locals said, "ya gotta do a jet boat" so sure glad we did!"

  "we had a great morning cruising up the rogue river from gold beach. our captain kevin was very entertaining and kept us laughing while he repeatedly soaked us  with his maneuvers. it was a non-strenuous very memorable time. we saw many bald eagles, a bear and river otter. i recommend it as something all age's would enjoy."

  "weather was perfect all day. our boat captain brandon was very knowledgeable and gave great answers along the entire trip. saw some wildlife, wished for more but maybe on the next trip. first mate andy did a great job, very curtious, and helpful! would highly recommend this trip for the entire family. we stopped half way and ate lunch in agness . great food and drinks!"
