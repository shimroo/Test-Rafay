"for i know the plans i have for you," declares the lord, "plans to   prosper

  you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." 
jeremiah

      charlie and debra returned to augusta in april of 2002 and embarked on the establishment  of shaw’s sunshine   gardens.  this marked a significant change in lifestyle  for the two of them.  debra once again  resumed her career and charlie undertook the role of “daylily farmer.”  charlie left a career as a board certified  healthcare executive with over twenty-two years extensive experience in  information systems, health care administration and financial management to  establish shaw’s sunshine   gardens.

 we are in our off season.  we can be available from 10:00 am  3:00 pm wednesday through saturday.  you must call to schedule a visit to the gardens.  our first day "open" this year (2025) will be saturday, april 30, 2025.



   update: believe it or not, now years later we are still contending with some id issues following the filming of the mule. our latest challenge has been the neighbor's chickens. they have decided that our gardens are a much better place to forrage for food than thier yard. in addition to scattering mulch everywhere, they seem to really enjoy throwing labels everywhere. the fun never stops.
we played host to clint eastwood for a number of scenes for the movie the mule. because of this our inventory status for some plants remains a bit unclear for now. take a look at the trailer for the mule.  you can see clint eastwood, aka earl stone looking into the gardens.
