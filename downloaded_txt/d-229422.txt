we're still alive! new music added from aground
how time flies... hello 2020! it has been quite a while since our last news post, but we are still alive and kicking. i hope everyone is keeping safe during these new challenging and uncertain times going on around the world regarding covid-19. what better way to stay safe than to stay home and enjoy some rpgn radio?! i hope we can continue to wake things up around here in the coming months. let's start things off with some new music!

we've just added a selection of music from aground. the soundtrack is brought to us by the talented chase bethea! be sure to check out his bandcamp to explore his discography. you might even recognize some of the tunes as we've had selections from many of his albums in our radio rotation for quite some time. 

be sure to give his songs some love and mash that upvote button! you might even spot him hanging out on our discord server... so hop on over and say hello.

happy 2019! rpgn migrates chat to discord
greetings! i guess we should get the obvious statement out of the way.... we are not dead! the site has been happily humming along with little maintenance as our admin team has been busy with life in general. 

i finally got some time to invest this weekend, and decided to migrate our chatroom from irc to discord. we've been happily situated on irc for almost 20 years, but most people these days don't even know what irc is, and we rarely get visitors dropping in to say hello... so it was time to find something a bit more modern to communicate with! you should totally drop in and say hello, we'd love to hear from you! 

site updates are slow, but our to-do list is ever growing and unending. we hear you, you want more music and it will be coming... hopefully sooner than later! stick with us as we start to get things up and movin' again.

top radio requests for january and february 2018
oh hi there! we haven't had one of these in a while and you may or may not have noticed that we have been slacking a bit with adding new songs to the radio as well. what can i say, everyone's busy with life and all those usual excuses. but today i found a little bit of time to post an update to confirm that we are actually not dead after all! i thought about posting top radio requests from all the months we missed, but that would make this post stupidly long, so here's the first two months of 2018 instead. nothing terribly surprising in there, it's the usual suspects with lots of undertale, some donkey kong country, some portal etc and the poet and the muse taking the top spot twice in a row. see you again, hopefully in couple of months. lets aim for under 6 months at least.

top radio requests for january and february 2017
it's time for the semi frequent, (almost) monthly top request update!
nothing too exciting happening here i'm afraid. everyone has been super ultra busy with boring life stuff and that always shows first in the frequency of radio updates, unfortunately. undertale still dominates the request lists as expected, but it also always warms my heart for a classic like aquatic ambience to show up in the list as well.

top radio requests for december 2016 and happy new year!
happy new year 2017 from all us here at rpgn! 2016 was a crazy year all over the world, lots of great games with great soundtracks came out, and rpgn turned 20 years old young. it's hard to even imagine a website being around for that long, isn't it? it also makes me feel really old. i'm sure holidays were a busy time for everyone, us included, but with the new year we hope to get back in the groove and start adding new songs more frequently (i already added a few songs couple days ago to start the year off). but anyway, now that the holidays are over and santa is no longer flying around the site, it's time to see what were the most popular requests in december.

top 25 radio requests for december 2016:
1. undertale - megalovania
2. alan wake - the poet and the muse
3. portal - still alive
4. the elder scrolls v: skyrim - dragonborn
5. bastion - setting sail, coming home
6. undertale - spider dance
