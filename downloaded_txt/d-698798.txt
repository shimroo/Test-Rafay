our caucus' priorities 











ensure individual liberty 



our caucus understands that the best form of government is one that empowers you to live free. we will always fight to preserve and defend your personal freedom and individual liberty. 











prevent federal overreach 



whether it is spying on your bank account or mandating vaccines, the democrats in washington, dc want total control over you. our caucus is one of the last lines of defense to protect against this affront to our freedoms. 











protect and expand the new hampshire advantage 



while democrats continue to try to implement an income tax, our caucus will fight to expand on the $171 million in tax cuts that we have delivered this biennium. especially where dc spending is running rampant and inflation is soaring, our caucus is fighting to keep more dollars in your pocket.  







"since president biden and the democrats took control of dc, there have been numerous threats on states’ rights and citizens’ basic rights. something must be done, and the new hampshire legislature is making sure that our basic freedoms are going to remain protected." - majority leader    jason osborne
