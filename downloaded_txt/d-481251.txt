mass decontamination
the radio crackles: "there has been a contamination of unknown
    substance at ...."  
    office building, factory or stadium -- regional first responders are trained to handle the
    decontamination of large numbers of people.

    carlstadt, hasbrouck heights, little ferry, moonachie, wallington and wood-ridge fire
    departments  participated in this hands-on mass decontamination exercise. the
    training was held on august 22, 2004 at a route 46 office complex parking lot  in
    hasbrouck heights, nj. classroom instruction preceded this drill.  this course
    is given to every fire department in northern new jersey and with this common training --
    all departments can mobilize in highly-coordinated, scalable efforts.

"jaws of
    life" training
    during emergencies, when a few wasted seconds can cost lives, the "jaws of life"
    are brought in to pry open accident vehicles and allow rescue workers to remove
    trapped victims from the wreckage.  we often read about rescues that used the
    "jaws of life". 
    what is it?  how does it work?

    under a blazing hot (85 degrees) sunday afternoon, july 11, 2004, the hasbrouck heights
    fire department conducted "jaws of life" training at the dpw yard.  two
    donated vehicles were used in the exercise that practiced the basic techniques that are
    regularly used by the department.
