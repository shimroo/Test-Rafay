sova services 










sova is uniquely skilled in working side-by-side with higher education leaders to develop student success strategies, build will for change, engage critical stakeholders in collective problem-solving, and support the implementation and scale of key initiatives. 



our work is based on the conviction that sustainable, scalable, high-quality innovation in higher education and workforce development must be designed and implemented with rigorous attention to the human dimensions of change. no evidence for change is strong enough and no idea is good enough to take the place of high-functioning teams capable of effective design, implementation, and improvement. we meet our clients where they are and help them navigate their way to what they need. 



explore our services 







sova helps in the following ways: 










strategy and business planning

we specialize in helping higher education leaders create robust strategic plans that drive meaningful change. our strategic planning services are designed to align vision, mission, goals, and financial resources with actionable steps for success. our holistic approach ensures that your strategic plan becomes a dynamic roadmap rather than a mere academic exercise.







adaptive change leadership

we equip higher education leaders and the institutions they serve with the skills and strategies they need to build healthy, inclusive cultures for student success innovation. we provide grounded insight to institutional climate along with neutral facilitation to help leaders navigate complex challenges. through a distinctive approach to leadership training and development, we build the capacity of leaders at every level to cultivate high-functioning and responsive teams capable of working across professional silos to better meet the evolving needs of today’s diverse student populations.







strategic communications and will-building

we empower higher education leaders and the institutions they serve to build genuine and durable will for large-scale, student-focused change. by providing equity-minded stakeholder analysis and issue framing, we help institutions generate, sustain, and expand momentum around key reform efforts. leaders at every level better understand how to build and maintain communication and engagement practices that undergird healthy, inclusive institutional cultures.







program design and delivery

we partner with philanthropies and leaders in higher education to design strategies and improve programs to better meet the evolving needs of higher education organizations and the students they serve. through careful listening, thoughtful facilitation, and shoulder-to-shoulder support, we guide leaders and their teams through the complexities of strategy and program development resulting in responsive, innovative, and sustainable programs designed to support and accelerate large-scale change efforts.







implementation support

we support leaders and teams of higher education advocacy and membership organizations to successfully implement new or revitalized programs and services. drawing on decades of experience in implementation science, process improvement, and project management, we help build capacity to assess resource realities, create action plans for success, and monitor progress towards goals. when appropriate, we also provide ongoing consultation and hands-on support to implementation efforts. 







equity impact

we leverage various sova team members who represent a diverse set of technical and subject matter expertise including diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (dei&b). our focus centers on operationalizing and activating equity—from ideation to strategy, from strategy to casemaking and implementation, and ultimately to evaluation and assessment through monitoring.






















who sova works with 



driven by a commitment to genuine upward mobility through higher education, we support colleges and universities, higher education systems, advocacy and membership organizations, and philanthropies dedicated to student-focused innovation on behalf of better and more equitable outcomes for today’s learners.
