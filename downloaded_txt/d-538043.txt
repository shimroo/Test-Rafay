 hagia sophia

is 
        a
church



the muslim world declares hagia sophia in constantinople is a mosque.
yet the fact is, hagia sophia was, is, and will always remain a 
christian church.   




 to worship in hagia sophia, 
muslims indeed honor and worship jesus christ, whose loving grace anoints 
them.

    religious
    freedom  provided by constantine the great enabled himto 
    establish christianity in the empire.

the edict of milan in 313 a.d. allowed tolerance 
    and freedom of religion throughout.
    reliable history book sources attest to this fact.  although far more a 
    soldier than a
    book devotee, constantine as history reports displayed considerable academic 
    aptitude
    to deal with issues in the letters and in art.  the book  seven gates to 
    freedom and its
    accompanying artlike with other  contemporary religious art and 
    publications and
    those of western history since constantine's timeall owe their presence to 
    tolerance
    and freedom of religion he set forth.

expansion 
    of western civilization: from
    constantine 
    the great to constantinople 
    and byzantium and onward to

america




new byzantium
is the americas


 we are sincerely pleased you have come to visit our site and we extend 
to you our warmest greeting in the highest tradition of 
byzantium.  our principal goal is to impart to you 
heretofore intentionally little known facts about byzantium as the foundation of 
western civilization. 
we will avoid knowingly withholding the truth as an aim to social 
disorientation.  practice of historical deception must cease. 
we hope that you will enjoy our 
contribution to the fullest.  welcome.


constantine the great began his eventful climb in york, england and 
reached the apex of his achievement in constantinople, the city that he founded 
and named after himself (constantine+polis 
[city]
=constantinople).  
by means of these pages, our readers travel through time, touching
upon the early periods, including that of constantine, of historical
constantinople, and of hagia sophiathe nexus of the christian worldto
arrive at places and events of our present day. 
our readers reach the outermost limit to which both eastern and 
western christian groups expanded, bringing forth the flower of western 
civilization.  that limit is the western hemisphere as a whole, and in 
particular the coast of california near san francisco and the golden gate bridge 
where the two groups converged  as they approached from the north and from the 
south.
