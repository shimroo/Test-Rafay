all is not lost
[apr. 13th, 2005|04:06 pm]
the adventurer




looks like my anger was a little premuture.  turns out that 2000ad'd reprint plans arn't washed up yet.  as news from 2000ad review points out.from: http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/news/2005/2000adnewsround1304.shtml---------------dc out. rebellion in.as many of you may be aware, the news recently broke that dc is not carrying on with the publication of either its humanoids or 2000ad line. this has, of course, brought forth much wailing and gnashing of teeth from those 2000ad fans who were happily getting a considerable and consistent flow of books, not to mention the promise of complete collections of certain stories in paperback format.well, the news we have is - it's not all over. we got in contact with matt smith, erstwhile 2000ad editor/green alien, and discovered more.while dc may have decided to stop their involvement in the publishing program, rebellion is certainly not shutting everything down. the news we have is follows:the collections will continue, and in the same size. we don't have exact news on whether we'll see absolutely everything that has been announced/rumoured but there will be much more. we will be getting more dante (courtship of jena makarov; tsar wars), rogue trooper (fort neuro; eye of the traitor) and strontium dog (portrait of a mutant; the killing) - news which will prove particularly gratifying to many a 2000ad fan. there will be one dredd book a month - concentrating on newer material, with total war and sin city expected before year's end. this all sounds much more like it, and the dredd news in particular sounds like a more sensible way of pushing the character and capitalising on the strength of recent dredd tales in the comics.the books will continue to be sold in the us, with rebellion providing marketing and information to previews etc. given that dc's american marketing was almost non-existent, this should have no effect on the american presence. with rebellion getting behind it, this could well increase the effect of the books on the marketplace. so worry ye not! we're sure more information will be coming from rebellion soon - and be sure to keep an eye on the 2000ad review forum and the 2000ad online forum for more information.----------------as 2000ad is my current favorite line between 2000ad and humanoids this is the most welcome of news.  long live 2000ad!

so mad right now
[apr. 12th, 2005|09:05 pm]
the adventurer




if anyone out there is actualy reading my lj they'll know i've promted the dc/2000ad/humanoid reprint lines twice already.  some of the best comics on the market.
newsarama reports: http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=31542&perpage=25&pagenumber=1] 
so dc's desided to cut the 2000ad and humanoids lines, and the newly opened well of european and british comics has officaly dried up again.
christ i'm so mad, i was so gung ho over these releases, and now i'm back to square one.  atleast a few of them had good runs, good memories of good comics.
 
*sigh*
sucks...

the ventureverse
[apr. 10th, 2005|10:40 pm]
the adventurer




i've never been a "small picture" person, it's a quark of mine, i'm always thinking two or three steps ahead of myself.  i'm not sure if this is a gift or a curse, but it's just my way.
i'm currently working on a book, a novel really, called hoboken jo. a contemporary fantasy story about the end of the world and the nature of heroes in such a crisis.
ultimatly hoboken jo lays the ground work for a larger body of works set in the same universe, of which i've dubbed the ventureverse for easy catagorizing.  and not just a series of novels, a series of novels, comicbook series, online webcomics, and oneshot original graphic novels, all leading up to a single concultion.
it's strange really, i've got about 10 pages writen of hoboken jo, and yet i already can see how the saga of the ventureverse will play out, how all the bits and pieces i drop alog the the way all cummulate atop each other to weave a tappesty of adventure and drama.
thing is, i've been making up stories in my head for over 10 years now, car trips, boring school classes, at work, all i did/do is write stories in my head, create characters, have them interact with one another see what sticks.  over 10 years i've crafted the intrecut workings of the ventureverse, it amazes even myself.  but the worst part is, over all that time i've never writen a thing down, not one word, i keep it all in my head.  well i'm tired of that, time for a change.
i'm writing up a storm these days, i've made hoboken jo a very important piece of my life these days, it's my single greatest goal of the moment.  i've got too many stories wraped up inside my head to just sit on them anymore, i have to get these out to the world and i have to do it now, or least i fear i never will.
as a break down my current vision sees 4 core stories with a number of smaller projects fleshing the corners out
hoboken jo - a novel - lays the ground work of the ventureverse, establishes the tone i'm going for, and a number of characters who will persist throughout the series, though not always in leading roles.
district 18 - a comicbook series - a superhero story about ageing heroes and the new generation who have alot to live up too.  it's about the passing of an age and the growing pains of becoming an adult.
stanley bicksford: certified exterminator - a novel - a comedy fantasy adventure accross a fantastic world on the bring of war and the one man who can stop it, is the universes biggest coward.
former glories - a novel - in the far future a change in leadership has stiffled the great age of space travel.  the galaxy is in the status of a total police state, and only the aging galactic adventurers, tossed aside in the promise of a "brave new tommorow", can save the people from themselves and thier new facist goverment.
then there are a couple of small projects
sordid romance: how jo meet george - is a comic book one shot chronicaling the first meeting of two of the main characters in hoboken jo.  it's a romance comic it's an action comic, it's a action/romance comic.
the jet brothers - a comic book miniseries about a trio of 1930s super scientists, and how the second world war altered their dreams of fame, glory, and superheroics.
bad vs. evil - another comic book yarn, this time, when all the superheroes vanish it's up to the remaining superpowered crooks, conmen, and thugs to protect their city from the truly evil.
and a few more in the early thought stages.
and the amazing part of it all, is i know exactly how they all fit together, and i know exactly how to keep them all stand-aloneish just enough to keep them individual works.
it's going to be a long decade, i have alot of work to do.

2000ad
[apr. 2nd, 2005|10:39 pm]
the adventurer




wow, a few weeks ago i begain reading 2000ad reprints thanks to dc's publishing deal with them, skizz, nikolai dante, and rogue trooper were my first purchesses.  these readings lead me to picking up a number of the weekly 2000ad progs, of which were pretty much badass and affermed my belief that the best in sci-fi comics come out of europe. 
researching 2000ad's other works i've come to their website www.2000adonline.com and i have to say, 2000ad has without a doubt the single greatest comic book website on the internet.  everything is so....orginized, all progs are indexed with their indiviual stories, the stories are indexed with all the progs the story ran, the creators are indexed with their work, the lines (judge dread, nikolai dante, invasion, etc...) are all organized with all the stories that fall under that line.  it's the single most cross indexed comicbook website ever.  and just by going through the archives you get the sense of the overwhelming, but because of how well crossindexed it is, you're never lost.
just by reading it over i've found dozens of progs i'm searching for in back issues and waiting for dc to publish in trades.  amazing.
just this wendsday i went and backordered a load of the dc trades...
  » bad company: goodbye krool world softcover  » the ballad of halo jones softcover  » the complete indigo prime softcover  » devlin waugh: red tide softcover  » devlin waugh: swimming in blood softcover  » judge anderson vol. 1: anderson, psi-division softcover  » red razors softcover  » robo-hunter: day of the droids softcover  » robo-hunter: verdus softcover  » rogue trooper vol. 2: fort neuro softcover  » strontium dog: the early cases softcover  » thirteen softcover
next week i should have about half of them in my long box. can't wait.

the adventurer draws
[mar. 31st, 2005|07:44 pm]
the adventurer




i'm no artist, but i tend to dootle alot.
this is hoboken jo main character of the novel that i'm working on of the same name.

she's an asskicking bag lady, combine gandalf, the golden girls, and shaft into one and you've got a rough discription of hoboken jo.  this is actualy a pretty good drawing by me, one of the first times i managed to get the eyes to look right.
 
this here is another character from the hoboken jo novel, named lucy

she's a witch.
this is an early draft of captain hudson, the leader of the para millitary group section 2 (tentive name) also part of hoboken jo.

i really really messed up his gun and hands, but the head looks pretty good.  though he doesn't look very milatary at all...
 
this here is my drawing of detective stevenson, the long forgoten nintendo character from the zapper light gun game gumshoe

it's a european (comics) invasion!!!
[mar. 24th, 2005|07:01 pm]
the adventurer




as of late i've gotten heavily into european import comics.  mostly thanks to dc's teaming up with 2000ad and humanoids, i've been getting a steady stream of some of the best science fiction, horror, and drama comics this side of the atlantic.
books from humanoids like the technopriest, the metabarons, the incal, miss: better living through crime, freddy lambart, and i am legion; and books from 2000ad like nikola dante, devlin waugh, rogue trooper, robo-hunter, and skizz continue to grip me and take a good chunk of my comic buying dollors these days.  they come as 15-19 dollor graphic novels with dimentions that match the height of your average american comic, but are wider to accomedate the wider art that all the books possess.  it's a great format, really makes the art look amazing.
this new found love of forein comics has lead me to picking up 2000ad the anthology magazine from britian on a regular bases, never in a million years did i expect to find such a great regular outlet for my need to read science fiction.  humanoids anthology mag metal hurlent comes out semi-regulary with some of the very best in horror/fantasy genres.  i love anthologies as they give me a wide range of stories, and comic talent in a single book.   currently i'm looking into picking up heavy metal for more anthology european style comics.
i don't know, american comics these days either stick to classic superhero routes, occasionally mixing in sci-fi, crime, and horror themes to mixed effect.  and the indy scene is sparse in the genres as well, and what does come out gets killed quick thanks to low sales. so these imports are a welcome site for this increasingly jaded comic reader (don't get me wrong there are alot of american comics i love, but the number is starting to wane these days)
many people have sworn that manga is the future of comics, with kids, teens, and adults alike flocking to book stores to read these "fun import comics from japan!" and while several of those titles are very cool (planetes, battle royal, lupin iii, gto) european comics have become my main source of import goodness.  
everyone should check out something from dc's humanoids and 2000ad lines, there's such a variety in genres there'll be something for everyone.

meet orson scott card today
[mar. 10th, 2005|11:25 pm]
the adventurer




orson scott card was doing a book signing at my local borders last night, and i have to say he's a fascinating individual. very outspoken, can get kinda rantish when he gets going, and doesn't have a high opinion of people who are hypocritical.  he's seems to be both passionate about his work and at the same time very much a realist about it (money).still i got my copy of shadow of the giant signed and got to ask him a few questions."after dabbling with comic writing with ultimate iron man, would you think of doing more, maybe creator owned, comic book work?"  he said that he's got a comic adaption of his novel 'worms' in the works, but beyond that no plans for anything else, but it's an option if he ever hits on a story that would be told best in a comic medium. kinda cool.and"would you consiter writing a prequel novel to enders game?" he said he's definitely doing a novel on rakum and the first and second bugger invasions.  sometime in the future anyway.  which is very cool.a great night all around.

marvelexiles #31: the exiles land on a world where captain america was biten by baron blood and became the new vampire king. cap and the other vampire avengers are going to turn san francisco into a city full of their zombie minons. of course the exiles are here to stop this.all hail the return of judd winick and jim calafiore as returning writer and artist. austin's run started out tolerable with his first 2 parter but went to crap in the last 3 issues. thank god winick's back writing a damn good story. calafiore does a bang up job on the art. much more expresive then henry who had the austin run.dc/vertigo/wildstormhuman defense corps #4: starting revelations about the whereabouts of the presumed dead soldiers from issue one turn up. the corps prepare for the their most daring mission yet, into the bowels of hell itself.not a bad issue, but the last two issues have been weaker then the first 2. but it's still a strong book, i hope it makes on-going at the end of it's run.bonus points for ww2 dc hero cameo from little sure shot.y-the last man #14: the isrealies plan to kidnap the last man on earth, yorick, to make isreal the most powerful nation on earth. but the discovery of two living male astronauts returning to earth from the international space station complecat things.not a bad issue, this arcs draging on a bit, but it should rap up next issue and the story will move on. those 2 astronauts better fucking survive!arrowsmith #2 private arrowsmith begins his training in the air corps for battle over the skies of ww1 torn europe in this alternate reality where magic and history are side by side. love maybe in the air for the men about to be sent over. but what is the milltary hiding from the new recuits?a fantasic issue like the one befor it. kurt busiek sure can write em. and pacheco sure can draw them.smax #1: finaly the return of top 10 characters officer smax and officer toybox. smax's uncle has just died and he and toybox travel across dimentions to attend his funeral. smax comes from a fantastic fairy tale world that he hates with a burning passion. antic's insue as toybox learns, the fantasy world isn't that much different then her world.it's great to be back in the top 10 universe. this book was full of great cameos and background nods to fantasy stories. alan moore is one of the greats. i'll give him that. the art was also top notch, it a bit cartoony,other companiestmnt: teenage mutant ninja turtles (mirage) #11: a final farwell as master splinter is put to rest after his passing last issue. cameos from all over the old tmnt run during the funeral. meanwhile some kids get attacked by vampires in central park and the foot has a run in with a deadly foe.man, the new tmnt series is just great better then the new cartoon book coming out of dreamwave. all though it is hard to just jump in do to this not being the cartoon turtles. there is alot different. but it's still great.and that's it for this week true believers.
