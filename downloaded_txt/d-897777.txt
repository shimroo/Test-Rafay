+ image infofuturefarmers zoom in on "assembly" by asking:"who is part of our assemblage?who is the other that co-determines or co-constitutes what is of importance?what provokes this pre-subjective process of communization?"with projects such as flatbread society, the futurefarmers collective focuses on concrete practice. they conduct hands-on exploration of how people and things, neighbors and grains effect each other...-nico dockx + pascal gielenaboutfuturefarmers is a group of diverse practitioners aligned through an interest in making work that is relevant to the time and place surrounding us. founded in 1995, a design studio serves as a platform to support art  projects and an artist in residence program. we are artists, designers, architects, anthropologists, writers, computer programmers and farmers with a common interest in creating frameworks for exchange that catalyze moments of "not knowing".  
while we collaborate with scientists and are interested in scientific inquiry,  we want to ask questions more openly. through participatory projects, we create spaces and experiences where the logic of a situation disappears - encounters occur that broaden, rather than narrow perspectives, i.e. reductionist science.
we use various media to create work that has the potential to destabilize logics of "certainty". we deconstruct systems such as food policies, public transportation, campus design and rural farming networks to visualize and understand their intrinsic logics. through this disassembly new narratives emerge that reconfigure the principles that once dominated these systems. our work often provides a playful entry point and tools for participants to gain insight into deeper fields of inquiry- not only to imagine, but to participate in and initiate change in the places we live.
futurefarmers have published a variation on powers of ten, sternberg press, 2012; for want of a nail, mit press, 2018. they have exhibited at solomon r. guggenheim, 2010, new york museum of modern art 2008, whitney museum of american art, biennial 2000, sharjah biennale 2017, taipei biennale 2018 and the walker art center 2009.people 
amy franceschini
san francisco, usa
amy franceschini is an artist and designer whose work facilitates encounter, exchange and tactile forms of inquiry by calling into question the "certainties" of a given time or place where a work is situated. an overarching theme in her work is a perceived conflict between "humans" and "nature". her projects reveal the history and currents of contradictions related to this divide by challenging systems of exchange and the tools we use to "hunt" and "gather". using this as a starting point, she creates relational objects that invoke action and inquiry; not only to imagine, but also to participate in and initiate change in the places we live. 
in 1995, amy founded futurefarmers as a collaborative platform to consider the social, political and environmental organization of space. futurefarmers use various media to deconstruct systems to visualize and understand their intrinsic logics; food systems, public transportation, education... through this disassembly they find new narratives  and reconfigurations that form alternatives to the principles that once dominated these systems. they have created temporary schools, books, bus tours, and large-scale exhibitions internationally. 
amy received her bfa in photography from san francisco state university and an mfa from stanford university. she has taught in the visual arts graduate programs at california college of the arts in san francisco and stanford university and is currently faculty in the master of eco-social design at the free university in bolzano, italy. amy is a 2009 guggenheim fellow, a 2019 rome prize fellow and a 2017 recipient of herb alpert award for visual arts. she received a creative work fund grant for new media in 2010 and graham foundation support for victory gardens (2007) and a variation on the powers of ten 2011.

for commodities' futures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the center piece of open outcry. radiating from this octagonal stage were a suite of relational objects illuminating ideas about the history of human civilization, from early technological innovations to cultural evolution, to the environmental stresses of industrial cultivation of grain. traditionally, the grain pit's raised octagonal shape allowed traders to be seen and heard at optimum levels. in the gallery, the pit was a modular sculpture that comes apart to host various events and gatherings; a threshing party, performances, artist talks, and a symposium. through the physical transformation of the pit, people can re-define and occupy this space that is usually locked up behind the doors of the chicago board of trade.\r\n<br\/><br\/\r\n\r\ninside the flatbread society grain pit bottles of ancient grains are displayed. in light of recent free-trade agreements between the european union, the united states, canada, and many south american countries, the practice of cultivating and saving seeds has taken center stage. in many countries this practice has become endangered, and in some areas it is now illegal. a small collection of grains here carry with them stories of brave and curious individuals who maintained and reestablished these landrace* seeds. some were once thought to be extinct, while others helped families to subsist in extreme environments. rather than being selectively bred to conform to certain standards and stored away in seed banks, landrace varieties evolve by adapting to a variety of environmental situations and to the agricultural practices used by the people growing them. flatbread society continues to collect and share these seeds, from one hand to the next.\r\n\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nthe term \"open outcry\" describes a method of communication between professionals on a board of trade. it involves both shouting and the use of specific hand signals to communicate buying and selling on the trading floor, also known as, the pit. flatbread society at the broad msu appropriated this term as the name for its public programming in an effort to evoke a series of spirited dialogues from different viewpoints on the nature of farming and agriculture, our changing relationship to grains, and the commodity of natural resources.\r\n\r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nflatbread society's open outcry was presented within the larger curatorial project, the land grant at the university of michigan in east lansing. open outcry consisted of an exhibition, an experimental bread oven, a series of public programs, a musical score and a publication.\r\nwith help from msu students and assistant professor of ceramics paul kotula, a clay tandoor oven was built in the broad's sculpture garden. this oven was used in a bread making workshop and during a discussion titled material encounters: what we make with baker\/artist boris portnoy. the oven moved from the campus to food fields, an urban farm in detroit, where it lives permanently. \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\n*the term \"landrace\" represents a classification of crops and farming methods widely present before industrialization, in which farmers did not grow a single variety of wheat in just one field. instead, they selected entire wheat populations for individual and collective taste with special characteristics for brewing, bread baking, and for survivability.","tn_url":"tn\/1414814670.jpg","tn_url_alt":"tn\/alt\/1414814697.jpg","load_external_url":"0","status":"0","location":"eli & edythe broad art museum,

while maintaining the 5x5 grid of traditional bingo. seventy-five inserts were printed with random configurations of the 75 lowest gnp countries. these inserts were silk-screened and laser printed to be included in each reusable board. the backs of the boards are composed of heavy tag board with one color offset printing. the fronts and backs are sewn together to hold the inserts in
