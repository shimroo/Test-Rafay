 fairfield youth baseball association fairfield, ohio 45014

 69th anniversary 1956-2025
 
                     
 
		  
	







 

emphasis is placed on learning the fundamentals of baseball and helping players and teams realize their potential through the values of hard work, commitment, teamwork and sportsmanship, in hopes that these qualities will carry over to all facets of life. 

through our league we've produced several major league players and many college players.

 fyba arguably has the best facilities in southern ohio. 
 
 we are appreciative of all the hours volunteers have spent making fyba the best in the area and look forward to even better things to come. 

thanks to the city of fairfield for the support for 69 years. 		  
	fyba board of directors
