are molds on food dangerous?
molds are microscopic fungi that live on plant or animal matter. no one knows how many species of fungi exist, but estimates range from tens of thousands to 300,000 or more. some molds cause allergic reactions and respiratory problems. and a few molds, under the right conditions, produce mycotoxins, poisonous substances that can make people sick. when you see mold on food, is it safe to cut off the moldy part and use the rest? you'll be surprised what you find when you look deeper into this food safety issue.

did you know that the 1905 book the jungle was a driver of the federal meat inspection act that governs fsis’ activities today? 
upton sinclair's novel took aim at the poor working conditions in a chicago meatpacking house. the ensuing public furor moved congress to pass the federal meat inspection act (fmia), which president theodore roosevelt signed into law in 1906 and requires federal inspectors in meat-packing houses.
