sleep is the anchor for overall health and well-being, performance, productivity and peace! worldwide, billions of adults and children suffer from inadequate or disturbed sleep. early recognition of the impact of poor sleep provides the greatest chance for timely intervention. consequences of neglect are life-long. attention paid to sleep brings positive impact. science and common sense support this. our goal is to provide a comprehensive, practical, review of normal sleep and sleep disorders across the life span. we review diagnostic tools, treatment options and long-term needs for patients and families. we provide guideposts for daily practice and future study. medical education is lacking with regard to sleep. it is our goal to empower all clinicians to understand sleep as a vital sign for our patients in daily practice.  all of us can act locally to decrease and, ideally, prevent the unnecessary negative health, psychological, and social consequences of poor sleep. those who suffer sleep disorders and consequences of insufficient sleep need our attention.
