middle east problem as explained by dennis prager






the middle east problem






the middle east conflict is framed as one of the
most complex problems in the world. but, in reality, it's very simple.
israelis want to live in peace and are willing to accept a neighboring
palestinian state. and most palestinians do not want israel to exist. as dennis prager explains, this is really
all you need to know. in 5 minutes, understand how israel was founded, and how,
since that auspicious day in 1948, its neighbors have tried to destroy it,
again and again…

memorial day 2014






memorial day 2014

taking a moment to remember those that made
the ultimate sacrifice while serving this great country of ours



.



memorial
day message

as written
by secretary of defense chuck hagel

washington, d.c., monday, may 27, 2013

image from dod

.

today
is a day for all americans to gather with friends and family in communities
across the country to enjoy each other’s company, and honor those generations
of patriots who have fought and died in uniform to preserve the freedoms we all
cherish.  we also grieve with those families who lost loved ones too soon
– parents, wives, husbands, sons, and daughters for whom memorial day will
always be a time of solemn remembrance.  the perseverance and resilience
of our military families is the bedrock of our military strength.

.

over
more than a decade of sustained war, the united states has been blessed to have
millions of men and women step forward to serve, to risk their lives and stand
watch in every corner of the world to defend our nation.  today we
remember the more than 6,600 men and women in uniform who have perished on
distant battlefields since september 11th, 2001.

.

the
men and women that serve today are as humble, patriotic, and selfless as any
generation that has come before them.  many have deployed on multiple
tours – active duty, guardsmen, and reservists – all citizens doing their part
for the country they love.  they continue to make enormous sacrifices,
along with their families.  we owe them and their families our most
heartfelt thanks and constant support, for they have added another chapter to
our nation’s book of honor.

about me





aubreyj.........


shreveport, la, united states
my pen name is aubreyj... i’m 60 years young and i live in shreveport, la. i've been married only once and that is to the same lovely lady named amy. (it’s hard to believe that after all these years she still claims me as hers!) have one daughter named michelle and two wonderful grandsons named david, (18) and chase, (13). i spent most of my adult life as a manager in the sales and service profession. today i am semi-retired and spend most of my time searching for news stories and blogging on the ones that i find news worthy. i’m a... just right of the middle... republican, who’s 1000% pro victory on the war on terror. i’m a strong supporter of the troops and my political party... even though i find myself in some disagreement, yet major disappointment with where the leaders of my party have taken us over these last so many years. sadly -- i still cannot find very much of anything that i agree with the dems on these days... god bless the troops... their families and this great country of ours.
