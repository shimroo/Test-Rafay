well. i suppose i should update this thing.i went to an eels concert, in the hmv playhouse at tollcross. great venue for shortarses, me and kat got great seats on the balcony, and saw pretty much everything (despite the figety couple in front). the support acts were pretty poor, but eels were fantastic, full of energy and the love for the music which makes me remember why i have so many of their albums.  also, mr e wrote a book. i'm guessing it is not going to be a cheery read, but think it will be rather interesting.after that i went to the gathering. it was ok, great to see everyone again, annaseed doing well in that no-one tried to 'kill the gribbly' and monstering was fun. they had a souped up ritual of peace which made being a healer a bit redundant, and pvp doesn't really appeal as i am not a fighter, so having more things trying to kill the faction is not such a great notion.  i like making campfires burn blue.then, on the way home from the gathering, i was involved in a car crash. everyone in the car is going to be ok, there are cracked ribs, and some broken bones, but everyone is out of hospital and doing as well as can be exspected. i suffered facial cuts over the left hand side of my face and damage to my scalp. i broke my nose. i lost a fair bit of blood, and got myself fairly bruised over the chest and left leg.  i spent the next week and a half in hospital, recuperating and getting patched up.i am home now, and recovering well. i have a patch of skin on the top of my head with no hair, and lots of stitches, and a couple of scars. i walk like a gereactic zombie, due to having a skin graft taken from my thigh, and generally trying not to move my chest too much (seatbelt bruises). energy levels are low, but getting better day by day, and i am not tanked up to the gills on quite so many painkillers. i was incredibly lucky. i probably will have some very thin scars on my left side of my face, and i have lost the use of my left eyebrow (writing that, it seems such a weird thing to say). there are options later on, once things have healed a bit to restore hair so its all really positive.the eyebrow thing, however, probably is a premenant. even with some really tricky surgery, the most positive outcome is about 50% restoreation of function, and it involved taking nerves from other bits of my body and cutting up my forehead, so i am probably not going to opt for that. weirdly, the two things i worry about is a) i use my eyebrows to signal 'query/question' in makaton, but i think it won't be too affected, and b) i draw myself in comic form. eyebrows are really critial to expressing emotion and i have been sketching. unfortunatly, when i draw myself with one leveled eyerbow, i tend to look either incredibly sarky or incredilus. drawing the scars is also rather odd, the detail level makes it look a lot wrose than it actually is, due to simplified lines.i went out to the shops, and had a neighbour (mr has lots of cats) stop and chat to me once he saw me limping about while getting a cup of tea. his reaction was in some ways very reassureing (he was kind, and seemed genuinely concerned, and then we chatted about cats) and in others ways has made me aware that i am going to have to deal with a lot of questions when people see me.   and after being out and about, i had to have a little 4 hour nap. i am off work, and though i know i have to take things slowly, i can well imagine going a little bit (more) bonkers while waiting to recover enough i can see my guys again. so, it's all odd, but the main thing is that i am ok, and going to be ok.  though i'm much more in favour of top gear/brainiac blowing up as many caravans as they can get their mits on.

so... jen went to london. it was a test of coping and seeing how i would manage without my usual coping mechanisms (ie, running to ben or kat for help). stress levels leading up to city break were high, due to me messing up the times of the meal.over the couple of days, a couple of things went wrong. flights were delayed, and i messed up the date of the flight back, meaning we had to book another night in a hotel, which was a major shift in plan. this, i thought, would have me devolve into a little panicky pile under a table, but actually, i think i coped rather well, surprising myself.i too myself and my brother neil down by plane (delayed) and we wandered london getting barings. we went to kidrobot (clinical, and rather dissapointing), orbital comics (amazing selection and many indy titles) and forbidden planet (huge and fun). we also went to cyber candy, which is great fun, if only to see that they made ginger ale flavoured kitkats.  we went and saw avenue q in the evening, and the performance was excellent. then, the next day, we went to the fat duck. this is heston blumental's resturant, and a bit of an extravagance. it was superb.  highlight for me were the palete clenising nitro poached lime egg white thing, caramel apple wafer pudding, the dry ice oak/moss truffle cracker, the hot and cold tea and the sweeties at the end. the whole thing was marvelus fun, i could not stop laughing from about halfway through.   but the staff really did make the meal, they were friendly and did a lot to put myself and neil at ease (we were the younger there by about 20years, at least! and rather out of place). we then had cocktails, and found that all trains back from maidenhead were cancelled. again, jen did not panic (and believe me, jen panics really well, she changes colour and everything!) we went, had another cocktail, found a mass of fuzzy little caterpillars, got on a re-enstated train, then got to hotel without any futher bother.lastly, we went to chinatown, which was a bit overpriced, but the barbeque meats i had at a small eatery were really good. and by the time we were leaving, i'd almost sussed the subway/train system.the flight back was delayed, and i am really not liking the 100ml rule. true i don't want to be blown up if traveling by plane, but it meant i could not bring jolt cola back with me. but cybercandy does do orders......so, yeah. i'm in a pretty self-statified mood after all this, and as long as i get someone to check over the things i am booking before i book them, i think i could do another holiday on my own. this is a big thing for me.in a mass of other news, i have two new rats, male, and one is hairless. i went larping and loved it. work is a bit stressful but looking like it will get better. i had to take down the really rather nasty 'antispyware soft' virus which is a beastie and a half, but seem to have killed it. playing with fire colourants, and making fire burn blue (campfires at larp burning blue is pretty cool).  stress levels been a bit higher than i could cope with over the last two months, but i think that is settling down now. stupid adverse life events.  and now beltane is over i can try to reclaim my beltaney friends back.  at least until sowneen....

so. what has jen been up to?  recasting of hands in wax to try and make annaseed's hand less scabby looking.  started a batch of gooseberry and lychee wine  finished part 2 of ben's b-day present... and its even on time... sort of.  playing dragon age (i got through 4 full character run throughs... this is an amazing game, full of fun and highly addictive. bring on the exspansion pack)  tinkering about with concept work for toy designs and customs  tumble drying stuff.   learning how to make a plush griffin by taking apart a stuffed toy lion.  hunting for older female rats for tangle companion (ip died).  celebrating that edinburgh council have realised that screwing over the support of adults with learning disablity is a bad idea (work is much calmer and happier now, i still have a job!) have project list which is still long and sporadically tackled. have a room which is getting silly-ly-y messy and cluttered.

jen did cooking and other stuff
[dec. 24th, 2009|03:34 pm]

yesterday i made a ballotine, a bird in a bird roast, which involves taking a wood pigeon and getting all the bones out, and stuffing it into a guiene fowl, which has also have the middle bones removed. you also cover the birds in parma ham to keep in the mositure. i have never deboned a bird before, so it was a bit of a learning exsperience, but the result was... super-yummy. i will definately do that again, as it was great fun, and i didn't hash up the deboning too badly (though at times the carcass looked akin to roadkill).i have also been working on my toy customising, which i really enjoy as a hobby. i have been making tiny little warhammer sized figure from scratch, and though they are a nightmare to paint (something i did not concider in the design or scuplt of the details) i think with a bit of practice they coyuld start turning out quite nicely. having small fiddly fingers is useful for the tiny little details, like using a needle point to crave sticthing detail. photos to follow, if my camera can get batteries charged and manage to not take blurry photos (might use a stand, but after getting to use kat's super-duper camera of joy, i think i will not get the same quality of photo)i am readying myslf for the festivemass madness, and will be quite glad when it is over. i've never been good with holiday stress, and my co-ordonation has so far had me slip on my ass twice, and facepalm the ground once. and i managed to resist building a snow-rat, especially as i would have wanted to stay out in the cold guarding it against snowmen smashers.merry times to all, and see you on the otherside of the year.

jen been doing stuff, including; reading a fairly heafty sensory intergration textbook, making little felted mouseguard figures (under the ( cut)collapse ), working much overtime, going to a wine tasting (actually a reconmended exsperience, but bring a friend as the poeple can be a tad stand off-ish, many thanks to the kat for her lovely compant), painting a munny(vinyl toy)ferret (no pics yet), getting a my little pony for xmas (junko mizuno designed it), being fairly organised for the oncoming madness of festivemass, seeing the family and being very impressed with my little brothers, watching my desk get swamped with craft and paperwork and playing little big planet on psp (which is ace).i plan to be at auld hoose on friday night, from about 8pm.
