very nice people. they are taking care of over a hundred cats and dogs. if you are considering getting a pet, please go and see all the adoptable cats and dogs they have.


















it is absolutely wonderful here! the staff is extremely friendly and always willing to help if you have questions. the animals are so sweet and definitely need forever homes. you can usually play with the animals and get a feel for their personality before you just walk out with one. delightful atmosphere all around. if you're on the fence about stopping by, even just to look around, please do. you won't regret it.
