 2025 reclassification list  the links below are for the start of the season. 2020 nebraska usssa   reclassification list for start of 2025.click on your age group for   information. (2025 is now official, but please remember, this is a starting spot for 2025)nebraska team   classifications are based on power ratings, tournament results and by overall   team performance on the field during sanctioned tournaments.any team that is   reforming from the 2024 season must start the 2025 season in the same   classification (or higher) than they finished in the 2024 season unless moved by the state director.for purpose of   classifications, if six (6) or more players from a 2024 team are on a 2025 team, they are considered the same team regardless of the team name, manager,   coaching staff or sponsor.any team that won or finished 2nd in the   2024 state tournament will be moved up a classification to begin 2025. teams that finished the 2024 season with 1100 power points will be moved up a   classification to begin 2025 and if they finished the season with less than 500 power points they will be moved down a classification to begin the 2025 season.  this is meant to be starting point only for the 2025 season. teams that are in the "a" classification must email so we can move you to that classification.the state office and   committee will make final classification adjustments around the 1st week of june   each season. this should give team’s ample time to prepare for state and   world series. please note that teams may be reclassified at any time by   the nebraska usssa baseball state office or by the usssa national baseball   committee. team's need to plan for state accordingly.undoubtedly, not   everyone will agree with classifications. any team wishing to appeal a   classification may do so after playing a minimum of three usssa   tournament games against teams from their classification after january 1, 2025. once the results for these games have been posted to the   usssa system, a review will be completed to determine if the team is   competitive at the new level. any appeal must be done via email to the state   office.i would highly   recommend that if you find your team in the (1100 to 1200) power point range   during the 2025 season that you make sure to play tournament games in the   higher classification to provide us information in making classification   decisions. otherwise expect a move up.  9u10u11u12u13u14u
