pacific sailing on the strikhedonia part ii









 during my life i have read thousands of books.  they have taken me to thousands of different lives and worlds. from fantasy to reality. they reside in my soul to make up a large part of who i am.  tonight will be my first night crossing on the pacific ocean on strikhedonia. our destination is isla isabel.

   i woke to hearing the anchor being hauled up.  it was 8:30 pm and chris was getting read to start our night crossing.  we had sailed only 10 miles before anchoring on the south side of mazatlan at isla de la piedra or stone island to rest up in preparation of sailing through the night.  the beach was lit up with colorful lights from the bars on shore. looking out to sea i could see two very large tankers that were anchored and waiting to come into port. chris put in the coordinates and we headed out between stone island and the tankers. i  was amazed at the size of the tankers and wondered who those people were who were aboard.  chris said they were probably of asian origins. a life at sea...i've wondered what that would be like.

  the night was dark without the moon.  we left the tankers and lights of mazatlan behind. in the dark of night i saw we had company.  a few birds had decided to night shadow us.  i would see them flicker through our dim running lights. the further out we went the darker the night became. the lights of mazatlan a distant memory. the stars were brilliant with no land interruption. i was on my first three hour shift by myself with chris sleeping just inside the saloon if i needed help. my job was to watch for lights of other boats and keep us on course. so the night begins.

   there are no words to describe the feeling of sailing a boat by yourself in the middle of the night.  when i was a child i read the quote "if you have a good imagination you can never be bored." it was my first mantra.  my mind raced with the words from thousands of adventures i have read and ancient dreaming of sailors past.  realization came to me on how the sailors knew where they were from the stars. i naturally oriented myself to the stars and the position of the boat and mast. i could tell by how far the mast strayed from the three stars that made up orion's belt if we had drifted a bit off course. just as on land we orient ourselves to the terrain and buildings such your mind makes the jump to the stars and horizons and shades of light.


   the swells were still large and coming at us from behind.  strikhedonia was built for sailing open ocean in any weather and this was her element.  i settled in and just called it surfing and enjoyed the ride. i would first watch on the open ocean side of the boat and look out towards hawaii. the sky endless and the stars unique. in my mind state the present place of time could be thousands of years ago or in the future.   i let my imagination run wild.  i felt my ancestors through me who had sailed the atlantic when they immigrated to america. imagining them on the schooners of their time making the crossing.  of all the adventures in life i've had this felt the most natural and in tune with my soul. when you touch water you touch every bit of our planet at once no matter where you are. when you put your hand in a stream you are connected to every bit of land that stream touches all the way to the sea.  when you touch the oceans you connect to every continent on earth. the pull to explore is strong. to see what is around the next bend of the river or the next horizon. it has always been hard for me to resist this pull.  incidentally i feel it when i am on the interstates...this road if i follow will take me to oregon, or maine.  

  my job of looking for the lights of other boats i took seriously. i spotted a horizontal line of light on the shore side of the boat. as i watched it seemed to get bigger. i asked chris what the light was and it was only the half moon coming up out of the ocean. such an optical illusion.  of course then the whole world changed and the light from the moon glittered on the waves. chris took over and it was my turn for three hours sleep in the saloon.


   your first sunrise in the middle of the ocean you can only have once.  the sky was clear and it was beautiful.  our destination arrival time was noon so we had the whole morning to eat breakfast and just enjoy the time. i spotted something off in the distance and alerted chris to a possible boat. he took his binoculars and announced it was the pinnacles.  good eye he said. the pinnacles are probably my favorite rock formation now to date. they are on the eastern side of isla isabel. two large rock formations that from certain angles appear to be a dragon in the sea.  fascinated with them i watched as the two rocks changed as our perspective of them changed. i saw what i thought was a sea blowhole and a second later chris yelled whales from his side of the boat!  we had whales on both sides of the boat.  what i thought was a sea stack spouting water against the pinnacles was a whale blowing!




   our original plan was to anchor in behind the pinnacles but we were still exposed to the swells so we sailed to the south side of the island and anchored in a cove with cliffs covered in hundreds of frigates and booby's.

  the overnight crossing to isla isabel was one of the most magical nights of my life. my description here pales in what it actually was to me. when your internal library is crammed with adventures read, experienced and lived combines with a mind that likes to dream, sailing into the night was fertile ground for magic. i don't think i can find the words to fully describe it  because it's something you need to prepare in life for and let your soul experience for yourself.  you will.   next up is the isla of booby's, frigates, and iguanas galore!

pacific sailing on the strikhedonia













 my friend chris sent me an email asking if i would like to join him on his sail boat this winter for a week or two cruise along the mexican coast.  oh wow!  yes!  i have never sailed before and this would be a chance of a lifetime to be able to do this trip.  we meshed our schedules and came up with one week from mazatlan to puerto vallarta.  january 26 to february 2nd.

  i was up early and drove up to my sons house to drop my car off.  he wasn't home so i used an uber. my first uber ride.  they were there within 5 minutes. the airport was a breeze leaving me with lots of waiting time for my flight. the flight was a breeze until we descended to mazatlan.  my seat partner nearly vomited on me.  i moved extremely fast and she made it to the bathroom.  whew!

  i landed in mexico!  my first visit to this country.  it seems a popular t-shirt design was "welcome to mazatlan.  the fun side of the wall!"  yeah.  the wall is kind of a big joke in mexico.   customs went extremely fast. my shuttle was waiting and i was dropped off at marina de mazatlan.

   chris came and met me by the road and walked me down to the marina.  my first sight of strikhedonia took my breath away!  photos do not do it justice.  just floating at dock it looked fast and agile. just beautiful! chris showed me my berth and i unpacked.  i had just a short time before we went to meet a couple of chris's friends at casa de maria.  it is owned by a couple of yankees that came to mexico and just stayed because they loved it. food was excellent and it was good conversation about sailing.  i didn't know anything much at that point so i just listened and learned whatever i could.  back at the boat a band played on shore. it was very cool to be in mexico and drift off to sleep listening to a mariachi band.



  sunday.  i was up early.  chris had a mechanic coming to look at getting some work done on the swim deck of his boat.  the man said 9am but it's pretty laid back and his assistant came after 10.  chris made plans to have the work done on his way back and we prepared to leave dockage. the route for the day was just 10 miles from the northern side of mazatlan to a bay on the south side of town.  just enough so chris could show me how to sail the boat.



  the channel out to open water was constricted by a dredge that shouldn't have been working on sunday.  as luck would have it a water taxi was on the side and chris asked him to contact the dredge.  they gave us the all clear and we picked our way between the dredge equipment. then we were out in the open water!

   the rollers were quite large but not breaking.  i was thrilled at how the strikhedonia handled the waves.  chris explained to me the navigation and auto pilot. how to keep on course.  the first landmark we passed was isla de pajaros. island of birds. one side of the island was completely covered in white bird dropping.  it made for a stunning sight if you didn't think much about it. next was reserva ecologica islas de mazatlan.  then we turned into a protected bay, isla de la piedra or stone island, for our anchorage. a band played on shore all afternoon.  the plan was to just eat and rest,  we were leaving at 9pm for an overnight crossing to isla isabel.  our eta would be close to noon the next day.  three hour shifts sailing the pacific through the night. excited?  damn right i was!

ride it down!









earlier this week i received an invitation for a vip admission to the new welch village mountain bike park .  they needed test riders to try out their new trails.  this project has been a dream come true for me.  i love downhill mountain biking and this is right in my back yard. 
  i arrived early and got my vip wrist band and headed to the lift.  the guys there asked if i wanted help loading.  i've never loaded my own bike and didn't want to try so i let them take it.  the day was just starting to heat up for a beautiful sunny day.  as i rode the lift up i couldn't help but compare the winter ski runs to the summer meadows they are now.  the morning scent of wild flowers drifted up evoking intoxicating memories of previous wilderness adventures. could life be any better?




 i'm two months out from knee surgery. this is going to be my first mountain biking of the season. i've been doing some road biking in town and tried just a smidgen of dirt last week to see how it felt. i was worried whether i was going to be able to ride or not.  the trails that are open are joy ride/blue and air bear/green.  i would need to ride em down today.
  i started with joy ride to warm up. it starts with some pump and traverses along the bluff and then drops in switchbacks, berms and easy jumps.  the features are well spaced and designed for just easy fun! this trail is long!  my strava said 1.5 miles. the only feature i had to walk the entire day was a tiny uphill stretch and that was due to my knee.  it was just a pleasant walk through some trees but it was up hill.  you gnarly riders won't even notice it. when the trail finally comes out on the bottom of the ski hill it zigzags to the bottom.  great for working on fast cornering!  the first run i took it slow.  the second i didn't.  it seems my legs were working with the exception of uphill riding.  but down worked just fine!




  now i set my eyes on doing air bear.  yes, the signs on the trail say expert dh. yes i saw some of the other riders with super pro downhill bikes and all the protection.  i wear protection also but they were decked. so here we go...air bear!
  it starts with a couple of table tops and then crosses an access road and then  the real steep stuff starts. my first rides are slower as a rule but there really isn't too much of a way to slow down on this trail.  the jumps and berms flow tightly together and just seem to get better as you descend. my plan for today was to ride until i got tired and then take my good camera out and get good action photos.  the only photos i took were of joy ride and i took them with my phone.  i have no photos of air bear to show because it was too fun to stop.  i just couldn't do it. (no apologies :) )




   for the rest of the four hours i had to ride i alternated between the two trails and then i just repeated air bear over and over. it's amazing!  being a sixty year old woman i like to get small air on trails like joy ride and that's easy fun for me but air bear really encourages you to get air and i was getting a conservative amount. i'll be working on getting more as the season comes along.
   the quality of these trails kind of sucks because it makes the old style trails obsolete. the engineering that went into the designs of these trails is just genius. changing topography into exhilarating fun has got to be the best job in the world. welch is working on a third trail right now and a fourth will be built immediately after that one.  welch owns a large amount of land and there is so much blank canvas here the possibilities are exponential. i'm looking forward to see this grow!
  the town of welch has always been a small welcoming spot on the map.  it has the cannon valley trail and welch mill tubing. it's tucked in a deep river valley away from the rat race of the city.  there used to be a fun campground on the river in welch but it was shut down. i could easily see the need for a campground here where you could ride all day and then kick back with a beer around a campfire with your friends. there is talk..... 




  the anticipated opening day is july 15th. i am really thankful i was able to have these four hours because checking my calendar i won't be able to make it again until august. by then the trails will be well worn in and fast!  maybe even the third trail will be finished!  the whole system is new to welch and it's a learning as you go process.  the lifty's were getting the hang of getting bikes and people on and off the lift.  they were a great crew yesterday!  peter has been putting in a lot of hard work to get this endeavor off the ground and up to the potential of making this a great destination spot close to the cities. tapping into the experts to make this fly.  world class instruction is in the works.  ladies too!
  as the day progressed i learned how to toss my own bike on the lift just like the big boys do. it is easy. it was sad to see the day end but i have a season pass and plan to be there every day i can.  can an old lady like me have anything more amazing than to have a world class down hill lift assisted mountain biking venue right in her backyard?  i think not!   ride it down!

rolling down the verm.  it's spring!








fun with selfies!


midwest whitewater begins with the opening of the vermilion river in hastings minnesota.  the last several weekends has been a paddling party with everyone knocking the dust off their boating.  this weekend the kettle opened up which made for a split.  most paddlers going north to follow the melt but a small group of us stayed local and played the vermilion again.  the weather was perfect!  no wind.  blue skies.  water that is above the freezing temperature so you could go without gloves.   most importantly, everything is still in and playable.  dan monskey and i met up at noon today.  two other paddlers were in the parking lot and they were doing their own thing.  bill kabitz who i've known and paddled with forever showed up but his group was still awhile out.  so it was just dan and i.  it was a social hour (closer to three hours) paddle.  fun with the camera.  the locals were out and i know both of us were going to be on many peoples cameras.  look at those fools on that cold river...kind cool eh?
  so there wasn't any gnar to report.  one roll that i heard of by one of the other groups.  too many smiles to count. plenty of fun play to be had!  here is a video of dan tearing up donut hole. wildman!  this joy sums up the entire day! click here -->  dan on donut

home on the change.





 

   it'll change your life they say.  try it.  it really will change your life. whoa!  wait! woman! what are you talking about?  what am i talking about?  change.  no matter how hard we try to stay the same the fact is, every day brings change. every perspective an option to grow. for some people change is horrible.  impossible!  even though it will happen without their consent.  change is a natural force that cannot be stopped.  but it can be directed.  it can be herded. sometimes as loose as herding cats but the direction is determined. change is what i look for in my students as a whitewater instructor.
  one of the biggest fears for many women when they first start whitewater kayaking is just the fear of changing.  it's a new perspective clashing with what your life was before you picked up a paddle. where will this lead me?  will i have to change my self perspective?  "i'm a little shy."  "i'm too old or too young."   "i'm not that brave."   i'm really just a mother/grandmother type."  all these are just tools that your mind uses to herd you in a determined direction.  i think i am, well then, so you'll be.  i like to break those paradigms.  kind of how i like breaking glass.  or popping bubble wrap. pop!  it's gone.
   i've taught and mentored many women and they never cease to amaze me.  a few come out of the gate a length ahead of the pack and charging.  most take it moderate, middle of the pack.  and some lag behind but are still running.  those women at the back of the pack are the ones i've learned are some of the most precious jewels on the river.  these are three examples of how they cope with change.
  the back of the pack ladies.  they are back there usually due to a physical or mental issue.  a fear of being underwater.  injury.  maybe just the years have taken their toll.  change is a scary thing for them.  the body can and will hurt when pushed to new limits.  learning to make the change slower actually makes them pay attention to the basics.  paying attention to what is happening with their bodies.  there are times i have seen a person with a physical limitation and adapted my instruction to get the best possible movement for them.  these are the ones who never quit trying and they celebrate the small gains.  the moment their eyes light up when they understand a connection to a stroke is priceless.  these ladies work hard to change.  it doesn't come easy for them, or for you, as the direction that they have been on before this is usually the opposite direction that you as a whitewater instructor want to herd them.  the change is a 180 degrees.  quite an accomplishment ladies!
   the middle of the pack ladies are what most of us start as.  we have health and attitude.  not too many preconceived ideas.  we don't mind change, but....oh yes there is that but.  women like to understand before jumping into the gnar just what is going to happen and just what they are expected to do.  they learn the basics and appreciate the changes they feel happening.  for them change is good and fun as long as there is full understanding of the metamorphosis.  they are like a beautiful day on the river. 
  now those filly's that took the bit in their teeth and are running full speed down the race track of change, well they just don't have any reservations about change.  they welcome the new transformation like an addicting drug. show me more! totally hooked on life, curious and impatient for every new skill you teach them.  they have to see what's around the next bend...every time!  change to them is a flow that they've fully committed to.  these are the ladies who have wisely stopped resisting change.  their learning curve is sharp and the rewards come fast.  i love this mind set!  i try to keep this as my mantra not only in paddling but in everything in life.
   change is flow. slow or fast. as long as you are moving you are changing who you are and what you can achieve.  the value of change is equal.  big or small, the self appreciation is the same.  the only difference is the length of time.  every woman can become a competent whitewater paddler. you will not be the same woman today that you were yesterday. you can only control the direction of the change today.  i wonder what you will achieve. i bet it will be beautiful.  see you on the river ladies!

flow





two and a half weeks of vacation!  my destination is west...somewhere.  i don't care much for schedules or agendas. this trip is all about finding where the universe takes me.  when you give in to trusting  god and the universe amazing opportunities happen!  believe it!   i loaded my car with a bike, playboat , and creek boat. i included my rock wrapping materials for my quiet times.  my first fun stop was bozeman.  special to me because i bought my occoee canoe there.  i asked a local for a good mountain bike trail and was directed to sypes canyon.    a beautiful trail!   then i drove on to missoula and spent the night in a wayside.  the next day i did blue mountain on my bike.  again the scenery was amazing!  that night the northern lights were predicted to be at storm level.  if they were out i wanted to see them in a great spot. 

  the lolo pass has always been special to me.  back in 1966 our family was taking a trip back to wisconsin.  the lolo at that time was a winding two lane road through the idaho and montana wilderness.  i remember as a child how beautiful the lochsa river was.  i couldn't get enough of watching it from the car.  we stopped to explore and my sister was ahead of me on a path and she came running down in a panic saying there was a bear!!  we left!

   we drove on and just before the top of the pass our new car blew the engine!  i remember being towed to missoula and having to stay in a old motel for a week while the car receive a new engine.  the only thing i recall from that stay, other than burnt pot pies for dinner every night was the movie we went to see.  run appaloosa run!  that movie literally changed the direction of our entire family.  upon returning home to oregon, we purchased an appaloosa mare and colt.  it was only the beginning of many we would own.  lolo will always be very special to me.

  my plan upon leaving missoula was to drive to the wayside at the top of the lolo pass and wait and see if the lights were visible.  another wonderful thing was the wifi i could access right from my car at the rest area.  reports were coming in from wisconsin and i was excitedly waiting.  usually i seem to scare them off.  then the street lights came on...dang!  i knew there was one of those gravel roads across the way that went up and into no man's land.  i started driving my car up for a good northern view.  the road became very steep and narrow, read that as scary, so i backed it down to a safer spot and waited.




  then my mind went to work.  "no one in the world knows you are up here by yourself."  "this is grizzly territory."  "you do have food in this car including the honey you used in the off road bars."    so i waited.  then all of a sudden pillars appeared huge across the sky.  then it faded to a soft green that would send pulses racing overhead.  i felt like the luckiest girl in the world up there watching my own personal show!!    i watched until i couldn't stay awake any longer.  i tried to go to sleep but the mind kept sending me a mind movie of me waking up with my face against my window and a grizzly face pressed up on the outside.  i gave it up and went back to the wayside.  on the drive down it was much more steep than i remember. ooops!  i saw no bears that night.  i haven't seen one yet this trip.  i will admit i am afraid of grizzly bears.  black bears i'm ok with. i would say i'm normal.

   i now have followed the impulse to make my next destination kelly's whitewater park in cascade idaho.  i have it in my mind to see if i can get my groove back on in playboating.  i came in late in the evening and walked out to watch the few boaters left on the river.  to my surprise i heard some one say "hi nora!"  aaron and jim from team papst were there!  so good to see someone i knew from my home area.  then i saw clay!  i hadn't seen him since chile.   i ended up staying with jim and aaron in the parking lot and while early the next morning i was sitting on the stairs with aaron i heard "hi nora" again!  amy e!!  she came up from boise.  such a wonderful day today.  catching up with amy and just hanging out.  could it get any better?  yep!  it did.  i took some advice and paid for a tent site right next to the park at a local motel.  the energy at the birch glen motel was so great i was thinking of staying another night.  i was also considering the cost as this needed to be a cheap trip.  the lady who runs the motel came over to chat and i gave her the heads up that i was probably going to stay another night.  she said the next night was on her!   there are few times when in life you know you are exactly where god and the universe want you to be.  this is one of them.  although i am doing a solo trip i am not traveling alone by any means.  the sun is setting in a twilight blue sky with salmon pink clouds catching the last rays of the sun.  i'm sitting here writing this blog post and thinking...tomorrow is going to be fine. so grateful for life.

  the last two days have been wonderful in every way.  i left the town of cascade idaho early with my intended destination being tamarack mountain.  it's a ski resort, downhill mountain biking and zip line wonderland of fun. so the website says.  what i found was a ghost town.  condos half built and left. no-one around. i asked some people who were setting up an archery competition and they said something about it being bankrupt and opening again after the fourth.  they recommended going to brundage mountain.  so onward i went.  they day getting on.  after a trip through the payette forrest by accident i found the resort.  i saw they had an event going on.  i walked up to the sign in table and asked how much for a lift ticket.  they were doing an event for the food shelf and admittance was canned goods or a dollar donation!  i was flabbergasted!  i had two bucks cash and donated them both. 

   next up. with my ankle still injured, i can't clip out of my egg beaters very well.  the bike mechanics changed my pedals for free.  i packed my knapsack with what i thought i'd need for the day and went to the lift.  scott, the lifty, explained how it goes to ride the lift with a bike.  very simple and easy. this was also my first time riding a mountain lift. woo! that's high up there.  at the top the view was beyond words.  more mountains and lakes in the valley.  they also had bike patrols that just hang out and talk to people.  they recommended elk trail for me.  seven beautiful miles of just about everything.  this trail let you experience all the beauty the mountain had to offer.  the profusion of wildflowers was more than i've ever seen.  every color and type.  natures beauty is beyond compare!  but always stop your bike to look. in fact i recommend stopping to look at everything. you will need full concentration for the trail as you never seem to slow down.

  this is my first time doing this kind of downhill riding.  i know i used up a bit of my brakes on my first few runs.  the trail starts on the top of the mountain. dead trees sculpted by nature into works of art.  wildflowers everywhere. rocks and packed dirt with occasional sand.  then you hit the field of yellow daisy like flowers.  so many personalities of this trail to explain.  i'll try to do my best. then you come into some trees. a bit of technical downhill through rock and dust. you'll cross a tiny stream several times on your descent.  my favorite stream crossing was the high berm to bridge to uphill mound and then a portion of really fast single track through the pines. the steam flowed over rocks in a special petite waterfall.  you'll also pass through pristine mountain meadows. then at the very bottom the trail takes a tight hairpin turn in deep dusty dirty and you are back on the lawn of the lodge but the fun isn't over yet.  the lawn spreads down around ponds in a stair step manner just perfect for multiple small jumps.  i got the idea watching a hotshot young man fly down them.  what a great finish. 

   over the two days i was there i did elk trail nine times.  i gave growler trail a try but it didn't overall have the fun factor of elk.  but there were some really great sections on it.  they have cut a new start to this trail so you aren't following the gravel road down and that new section will be open next year.  i did this trail once. 

   i have always been in love with my bike.  it's perfect for me in everyway.  these two days i was able to really let the bike do what it was built to do.  each run got faster.  the second day i rented some knee and shin guards.  funny how good protection makes you more confident.  the second day i was flying.  first one on the lifts in the morning and i was able to get six runs in.  each run going faster.  the fourth run i timed.  33 minutes!  i shared it with scott and we  timed the fifth run at 30 minutes!   i know i flew on that run!  but it was a long hot day.  i'd taken only one lunch break and only ate a tiny bit of my salad.  i knew there were a couple of mistakes that i'd made which told me the end of my ability was near.  i did my second run leisurely.  stopping at my favorite views to take a photo or just breathe in the energy of the immense landscape. i came to the bottom and was looking forward to putting in everything on the last lawn jumps.  i wiped out on the hairpin turn just feet from the start of the lawn.  no damage done but since it was powdered deep dirt i was covered in it!.  i righted my bike and hit the jumps.  i dropped down to my car and grabbed a couple of na beers.  my lifty enjoyed his the day before so i tipped him another.  i was back at the lift just minutes before they shut down.  i decided to take the scenic tour.  i drank my beer as i rode up to the top looking at the place i'd just spent two days and 68 miles getting to know.  i think i had met most of the crew that worked there from the store to the restaurant to the liftys and patrols. i think they only hire the most wonderful people in the world.  they were all great and it was very, very hard to leave.  i could live at a place like that.  it felt like home. 

  i left the mountain with bend, oregon programmed in my gps.  i drove until i could drive no more and slept in burns, or.  i made the drive to bend and decided on a rest easy day.  plus everything i have is dirty.  laundromat first where people sit with their beer and wine while their clothes get washed.  car wash second and now just writing my blog at starbucks in the air conditioning.  very hot outside.  i'm going down to the gear store to see what kind of deals they have.   i still have over a week of vacation left.

seriously dude!











rapids riders:    seriously dude!  careful of that shit.  it's more addicting than crack.  i'm warning you right now.  your life will change so rapidly you won't know what hit you.  you'll immediately have 30 or 40 new friends all with the same addiction in varying degrees.  you'll never be the same.  you'll be a boater.  kayaker or canoeist, whitewater will be your new drug.

                    

newb:    how???  really!  how does this happen??  nothing can be that life changing that fast.  i think you're full of it.  what ever "it" is.





rapids riders:    canoe u, you see.  there is nothing like it.  anywhere. and it's right here in minnesota!  a non profit (unlike other addictions) organization that just wants to teach you how to run whitewater.  we're cool.  low key.  a day at the pool first.  then a weekend out at st croix state park in some rustic cabins.  good food.   fireplaces.  learning to j-lean and stuff on beautiful spring rivers.  wildflowers blooming. spring breezes.  eagles...maybe an otter.  camaraderie that you never want to end.  you leave the first weekend looking back at a whirlwind of fun and learning.  then you have two weeks to practice before we take you out for another weekend of rivers, campfires, food and really becoming a changeling. from what you are now to whitewater boater.  that's it really.  from there all the rivers in the world open up to you.  places before denied to land lovers are now rivers of challenge and wonder filled with all your new friends.  it's a bit overwhelming to have that much fun but so far there doesn't seem to be an overdose level.





newb:    i suppose i have to be young and look like those dudes in the videos.   hucking 100 foot waterfalls.






rapids riders:    nope!  there are all levels of paddling.  something for everyone of any age.  we have grandmas that are paddling!  and we have some people out there hucking those huge falls!





newb:    yeah...but there has to be a catch.  why would all those people do instruction and cooking and organizing all for nothing. this sounds fishy.  what's in it for you??





rapids riders:    we do have uses for the money we take in.  we give it back to the rivers in donations.  wausau whitewater park.  the vermillion river clean up.  we have winter pool session every sunday and we make sure our instructors are up to date with the best knowledge and certifications.  oh and we have a christmas party.  we can't forget to party! 







newb:    ok how much does it cost.  this has got to be crazy expensive.  those outfitter places ask about a thousand bucks or more for 5 days of instruction.





rapids riders:    we charge $270.00.  here's a link if you want more information.  canoe u information





newb:     duuuude!!  i'm excited!  i'll take this course!  oh wow!  it's starts may 3rd!  

rapids riders:    yeah!  get on it.  we have a few spots left.  

disclaimer:  with life changing events such as these be prepared to buy a boat.  then another boat and maybe even a third or fifth.  buy a paddle.  maybe a break down paddle too.  and maybe one for play.  drysuits are the bomb. color coordinate your helmets and pfd's.   travel will be upper most in your mind.  trip planning will become an obsession.  you'll learn a whole new language filled with boofs, carping, and many other new words that no one else will understand.  wet dreams take on a whole new meaning.  you will learn to curse and/or love the weather with a passion.  and you will love every minute of it.

a little more information on learning to paddle midwest whitewater can be found here.

rapids riders is a non profit organization run by people who love to teach new people to paddle whitewater.  we do it because we love it!  it's that simple!  come and join us on the rivers!

the lester river race!  








almost always


as ancient as evolution, a shiver of excitement runs through the collective souls of a united tribe of men and women.  not quite fully aware of the cause but knowing something is triggering the feeling of anticipation of something coming.   instinct?  the sun, older than time, gracing us with a little more comfort each day?  the scent of the breeze?  it may be dead of winter in minnesota, but spring is so close we can feel it with our souls.



limbo falls



  with the spring melt comes the thunderous power that is unique to the north shore of lake superior. creeking season arrives fast and furious. the tribe is alive.  frantic to catch the fleeting world class whitewater before it's gone.  each year it's a different personality but it all starts in one place. duluth!  with the lester river.  it is the beginning.








  ryan zimny had a vision a few years ago. the lester river, in the city of duluth, is the perfect venue for a class iv/v race.  this was no easy task to achieve.  it isn't dam controlled,  you get water when mother nature blesses you and only at the levels she determines.  the tribe, as malleable as the water we follow, adapts.  the race date is a guess.  racers from all over the midwest wait with their whole being  tuned to the weather.  ryan makes the call.



 race organizer, ryan zimny.



   the inaugural race was held in 2013.  the year before was the great flood of 2012.  things had changed on the river.  the pinnacle of the race was to finish after running almost always.  a class v,  25 foot narrow waterfall aptly named because it is "almost always" portaged.  a handful of young world class boaters probed the falls to see if the changes were acceptable. it wasn't pretty. a little bloody. but no serious injuries.  almost always was taken out of the race and the finish was marked just before the falls.



chris baer successfully dropping almost always.



  the level was good and as friendly as an extreme whitewater race can be.  spectators were able to line the banks all along the river due to the road and a wonderful  city trail system that follows the river.  the first race went smooth.  volunteers and safety working together like a precision machine.  john mcconville taking first place!  the lester river race was established.



jackson kayak's john mcconville.  two time winner of the lester race!



  the winter of 2014 was a very good year for snow.  it laid silently in the watersheds of the frozen creeks.  the promise of a spectacular creeking season.  the melt started like a highlander kicking in the door on a tavern.  it arrived and we went to meet it.  ryan had made the call and the race was on for the following weekend.  the week of the race the creeks were in a rage.   mother nature was a sassy lady demanding only the best from those who would try her creeks. dealing out serious injuries to some who attempted to ride. throwing a midweek snow storm at us like a snowball to the face. the great lady laid down her challenge!



midweek scouting for water.




   saturday race day came!  the water was raging.  this year four ladies considered running the race.  myself one of them.  the other three were strong beautiful paddlers.  young women who had never or rarely ran the lester river before and that is required for the race.  the men, always happy to help the women,  put together a pre race run to introduce the ladies to the river.  all three ladies walked off before the end of the run and two of the men came away with dislocated shoulders. naked man rapid was taking its due.  there was no doubt that this year was going to be epic.  some soul searching was done by all the paddlers, men and women alike, and the race roster reduced.  anticipation was high.



danielle magnuson dropping limbo falls in the pre race run.



  the second lester river race was fast! with all the pre race carnage the actual race went off good with just a couple of  dnf's and a few stitches.  congratulations to jackson kayak's john mcconville for taking first place again for the second year.  this year the river banks were lined with hundreds of spectators.  the race is firmly established as a rite of the northwoods spring.



oh shit rapid just before the finish line.



   three is the charm!  2015 is here.  the race is on every paddlers mind. the third lester river race!  who will race this year?  who will win?  the midwest is a rapidly growing community of boaters with a history unique unto itself.  there is a consensual awareness that this race, the lester river race, is going to be a huge part in our destiny.  an epic novel with a different chapter written each year by all of us and edited by mother nature.  will you be racing?  can you adapt to brutally freezing water with occasional ice chunks?  can you run the intro rapid and limbo falls? are you brave enough to face naked man?  mini octopus? oh god?  oh shit?  the conditions are far more brutal than other extreme whitewater races. this is the north shore and it's not for everyone.  is it for you?

wisps of thoughts....





day dreaming about emerald forests with unicorns and fairies.  gossamer 
lines of bubbling white and the muddled brown rhyme of an endless trace.
  summer.

about me





nora whitmore


red wing, minnesota, united states
i started sea kayaking in 2002 and quickly  progressed to whitewater. i am an aca whitewater instructor and i volunteer teach through rapids riders. between kayaking and surfing i can see why many people have spent their lives beach bumming.  if i could i'd become a river gypsy full time.  there's nothing i love more than to be on a river. i travel and love to take photos of people in their "rock star" moments. i have one really great son, shane.
  winter comes and i snow kite, cross country ski, downhill ski, telemark ski, rock and ice climb and mountain bike. always looking for the next adventure whether it's in my back yard or miles distant...when you look you will usually find one.   i'm also an agate nut!  
  my blog is a way for me to share my paddling life with my non-paddling friends and family.
