pope francis’ encyclical: dilexit nos




    click here to learn more about dilexit nos and the influence of st. francis de sales and salesian spirituality on the pope's writing.  
  

 
























salesian spirituality a lived and lively tradition inspired by st. francis de sales (1567-1622) and st. jane de chantal (1572-1641). salesian [suh-leez-juhn] spirituality emphasizes common sense and the power of doing little, ordinary, and everyday things for god and others with great passion and great love. it is a down-to-earth way of living the gospel of jesus christ.
