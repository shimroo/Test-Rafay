greetings and thanks for taking the time to check out my blog, a locking story. my name is katika and i have been wearing my hair in the sisterlocks method of locking for the past two years. prior to this, i was completely addicted to creamy crack but secretely in love with the natural texture of my hair. i’ve loved locks every since i was a little girl watching whoopi goldberg on tv. so, many years later  i made the choice to lock my hair. october 2003, alva clemons (http://www.anaturalknockout.com) welcomed me into the world of sisterlocks. i haven’t looked back since! two years later and i know the best is yet to come.



***please leave comments, i'd love to know you were here!***

lock styling on a hot, summer day





greetings,boy, it sure is hot here in the atl! temperatures have reached the mid-90s with no end in sight. of course with all the heat, the one thing i am most obsessed with is...my hair. what in the world can i do with hair this long? braidouts? nope. curls? probably not! so, my new thing is updos and ponytails. here's a few pics of my latest (messy) hair do. any suggestions for cool summer 'dos are welcome! chat later,klw

it's been a long time...





greetings sl familyand followers,its been a long time...but i'm still here ;). i'm not sure where to start as it has been over 2 years since my last post! i look forward to reconnecting and sharing a little bit about my life since then this summer. in the meantime, here's a few lock updates and pics from my recent vacation:1. october 2010 marks 7 years since i started my sisterlock journey.2. several trims and dyes later -- i still love my sisterlocks...3. my hair is still professionally maintained by my original sl consultant, alva clemons of a natural knockout. (i tried the self retightening thing, it just doesn't work for me).4. every two years or so, i get a little itch to try something new...i'm seriously thinking of cutting or starting over. i haven't made a decision yet, so stay tuned!chat soon, k

lock styling on a rainy day...





greetings all,seems like lately all of my posts have had something to do with the weather. now, i don't no if its mere coincidence or if i am more likely to blog when i'm stuck in the house. nonetheless, i just wanted to share some quick pictures of my latest style creation...my first ever (successful) lock bun. i saw a tutorial on youtube (can't remember from whom)and decided to try it. it was quick, simple and required no hair pins, just a simple elastic holder.  now, i know its a little messy and i am still working out the back (this is my first attempt afterall)...but it was so cute i wanted to share. check me out in color below!>later,katika
