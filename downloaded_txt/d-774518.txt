                                        is far from complete, but
                                        it's the next big project
                                        (tm) so it deserves a

                                        it's my homage to the

                                        strategy games that i
                                        enjoyed circa 1995.
                                        unlike them, however,
                                        empyrion lets you design
                                        your own maps, units, and
