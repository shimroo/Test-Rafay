visit the joshua tree outdoor museum. 




it is crucial to acknowledge the ancestral, cultural, and unseated territory of the serrano people. historically, these indigenous people thrived in the san bernardino mountains and the southern mojave desert of california. the noah purifoy outdoor museum of assemblage art, a testament to human creativity is situated in the san manuel band of mission indians area, known by its traditional name yuhaviatem (yu-hay-vee-a-tam) or “people of the pines”. we deeply respect and honor their elders and celebrate their current vitality and that of their future generations.
