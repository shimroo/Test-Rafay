ravinia nurtures the next generation of music lovers, makers, and leaders 
 


 
 
reach teach play several programs extend ravinia’s reach into chicago and lake county public schools that otherwise have little to no music curriculum of their own, providing 20,000 students with live performances and integrative activities that spark a love of music and invite exploration of varied genres and styles, as well as programs that teach the foundations of music and encourage children to engage in music-making and express themselves creatively.
more about reach teach play 


 
steans institutefounded in 1988 in honor of lois m. steans, the steans institute is an international destination for exceptional musical talent, cultivating the next generation of classical and jazz musicians. our world-renowned programs empower emerging professional pianists, string players, singers, composers, and jazz musicians to refine their craft, collaborate with peers, and elevate their musicianship to new heights. the steans institute provides more than artistic training—we are a community where talent meets opportunity, and passion becomes performance.
