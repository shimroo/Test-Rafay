about us

the veloteers bicycle club's mission is to promote interest, educate and encourage fun and safe bicycling in all forms. the funds we receive from memberships and our sponsors support the operations and growth of the club and the growth of cycling in wilson and surrounding counties of tennessee.in the past we have provided funds to help build and maintain eagle park, in mt. juliet, which has become a wonderful resource for beginning riders. we support the mj bpac’s annual event, ride mt. juliet and work in tandem with the mjpd and mjbpac on the annual, international ride of silence.
we are a non-profit 501(c)3 organization. established in 2003, we offer a full ride calendar april-september, and weekend rides during the off-season. our special events include rides on memorial day, july 4th, labor day, thanksgiving and new year’s day.


what is a "veloteer?"
derived from velox and volunteer: velox is a latin word meaning swift or rapid, and used by the french to describe an early bicycle called the velocipede. velo is now a common prefix for bicycle related subjects; tennesseans are referred to as volunteers, a nickname given to us by others who admired the volunteering spirit of tennesseans in such wars as the battle of 1812 and the battle of the alamo. tennesseans still proudly carry this nickname.
