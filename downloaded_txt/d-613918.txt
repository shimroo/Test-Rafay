about propane faq











what is propane?




propane is a versatile hydrocarbon gas used as a fuel source for various applications. it is a byproduct of natural gas processing and petroleum refining and is stored and transported as a pressurized liquid. propane is known for its clean-burning properties, making it a popular choice for residential, commercial, and industrial uses.
learn more about what is propane.

 








is propane the same as natural gas?




                                        propane and natural gas are both hydrocarbons, but they are not the same. propane, also known as liquefied petroleum gas (lpg), is classified as a low-carbon fuel, offering a cleaner alternative with lower carbon emissions compared to natural gas, which is primarily methane. as a cost-effective, versatile fuel, propane is widely available for various applications and stands out for its efficiency and environmental benefits. while natural gas has its advantages in specific regions and uses, propane is the preferred choice for those seeking versatile, high-performing and cost-effective energy solutions.

learn more about the differences between propane and natural gas.
                                        







does propane expire?




                                        propane does not expire, unlike some other fuels. its chemical composition allows it to be stored without deterioration over long periods so that it’s available for consumption anytime. it’s one of the reasons why propane is preferred for back-up power generators as a reliable source of power in the event of an outage or emergency. additionally, propane tanks are designed to withstand temperature changes, ensuring that these fluctuations do not affect the propane gas inside.
                                        







does propane freeze?




                                        propane and propane tanks do not freeze under normal circumstances; therefore, you do not need to worry about the tank or the propane itself even in very cold temperatures. propane systems can handle the cold, and when the propane tanks are installed, temperatures are taken into consideration to make sure the propane system works and performs as intended. visible frost outside the tanks is a common occurrence in low temperature areas and does not mean that the tank or the propane inside it are frozen.

however, it is important to keep an eye on the performance of your propane system. if performance has been affected, or new propane appliances have been added, then it's time to contact your propane supplier or a licensed technician that can evaluate your propane system and assess if you have the right tank size for your needs.
                                        







what is propane used for?




propane is used for a wide range of applications due to its cost-effectiveness, high energy output, and versatility. it's commonly employed for heating homes and businesses, as well as powering appliances such as stoves, water heaters, fireplaces, outdoor heaters, pools and power generators and more. learn more about propane uses.

propane also supports multiple commercial and industrial needs, being an efficient energy solution for businesses in hospitality and restaurant industries for heating, cooking, back up power and more. propane is also well known for its industrial applications in sectors such as mining, construction, and agriculture, where it powers tools and machinery, fuels forklifts and fleets with auto propane, and provides heating and drying for crops. additionally, propane warms large spaces and construction sites and generates power for these environments. this showcases propane's versatility and efficiency as an energy source for a wide range of uses. explore propane’s commercial applications for your business.

how long does propane last?




                                        if your tank is appropriately sized for your usage, rule of thumb is generally two propane tank refills per year for non-heating applications. you may require more frequent tank refills if you're using propane as your main heat source plus auxiliary applications like a fireplace or stove. keep in mind, the length of time may also depend on the size of your home, how many appliances run on propane, your indoor temperature setting if using as a main heat source, and outdoor temperatures to name a few factors. it’s essential to monitor usage and schedule timely refills to avoid running out of propane.

what does propane smell like?




propane is odourless, but an odorant called ethyl mercaptan is added to give it a distinct and easily detectable odour. this odour resembles "rotten eggs” to help identify propane leaks for safety reasons.

in emergency situations or if you suspect a propane leak, be sure you know how to safely shut off your propane supply. to do this, locate the service shut-off valve under the dome or lid on top of your tank. turn the valve clockwise as far as possible to turn off the supply. it's a simple step that can keep you safe during an emergency.

if you ever suspect a propane leak, characterized by a "rotten egg" smell due to the added odorant ethyl mercaptan, evacuate the area immediately and contact customer service at 1-87superior (1-877-873-7467) for immediate assistance.
