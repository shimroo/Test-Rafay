farm fresh milk



a family-owned and operated jersey farm



























taste the difference



we think you'll notice one right away.this is fresh. our milk is pasteurized and bottled right on the farm, within hours of milking. it's also rich. jersey's make the richest, creamiest tasting milk, that’s also nutritionally superior to other market milks, with up to 18% more calcium and 20% more protein. and because it’s naturally a2, it’s easier to digest. taste the difference and enjoy!




































































premium milk



our milks are all naturally creamy, rich in flavor, and higher in calcium and protein.



















































wholesome and natural



our milk doesn't contain any added preservatives, and our cows are not treated with any growth hormones. the cows live a comfortable life, and their diet consists mostly of hay and corn grown on fields surrounding their barn.





































































family farming



since 1904, our family has been farming this land. although we've made a lot of updates along the way, farm sustainability & land preservation are always on our mind.










































our quality guarantee















reassurance of knowing exactly where your food comes from is something that we want for our families. that’s why we take pride when you choose mapleline milk for yours. we take this responsibility seriously, and it goes beyond just putting quality milk in a bottle. it’s ensuring that we always employ ecologically-mindful practices throughout, and maintaining a low carbon footprint to safeguard our natural resources...for the benefit and enjoyment of our future generations, and yours.



























we’re celebrating our 120th anniversary in 2024!
