the chicago automobile trade association (cata), the chicago-area’s new-car dealer association, once again partnered with the uso to host the 11th annual bbq for the troops fundraisers. to date, 60 local new-car dealerships rallied their communities to bring in $81,267 for the uso. the barbecue-themed events, held last month, featured everything from patriotic ceremonies, classic car shows, live music, games for kids of all ages and, of course, barbecues. additionally, participating dealers donated to the cause for every test drive that took place in the month of july. 
“supporting our local communities and those in need is right within the wheelhouse of our local car dealers and what better way to make an impact than rallying together for this great cause,” said cata chairman jason roberts. “we are thrilled to once again present this check to the uso who do such crucial work supporting our service members and their families.”read full story
