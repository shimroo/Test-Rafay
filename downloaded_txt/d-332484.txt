twiki interviewed by robert scoble



twiki got interviewed by well known blogger robert scoble: "how work is changing with the open source wiki pioneers: twiki."



twiki®
is a flexible, powerful, and easy to use enterprise wiki,
enterprise collaboration platform, and web application platform. it is a
structured wiki, typically
used to run a project development space, a document management system, a
knowledge base, or any other groupware tool, on an intranet, extranet or the
internet. users without programming skills can create web applications.
developers can extend the functionality of twiki with plugins.
twiki fosters information flow within an organization, lets distributed
teams work together seamlessly and productively, and eliminates the
one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.
twiki has been downloaded over 700,000 times and is used daily by millions
of people in over 100 countries. some larger deployments have over one
million pages and over 10,000 users. twiki is developed by an active opensource 
community on twiki.org.
more details.


looking for the best wiki?
compare twiki, confluence and socialtext,
and see twiki details
on the wikimatrix web site.

what does it look like?
twiki looks and feels like a normal intranet or internet web site.
however it also has a edit link at the bottom of every topic 
(web page); everybody can change a topic or add content by just 
using a browser.
  
twiki is hosted and developed here at the twiki.org web site. 
you can surf and add/change content to get an idea of how twiki works.
start surfing at the
webhome topic, or learn
about the platform in the
welcome guest.


who is using twiki?
twiki is installed on many web sites, mainly behind corporate
firewalls. many major companies use twiki because it is very user 
friendly compared to some well established commercial groupware 
systems like lotus notes. read some
twikisuccessstories
to get an idea of how companies such as motorola
(story) or sap
(story)
use the twiki platform.
  
read also the testimonials
to see what other people say about the platform.
twikiinstallations
has a small list of twiki installations and clones. (note: in case
you installed twiki on your server, please add it to the
twikiinstallation
directory.)
how is twiki being deployed?
a wiki is a enterprise 2.0 
platform to create share and remix content. twiki as a structured wiki
goes a step further; it enables users to automate their workflow by 
creating custom tailored wiki applications.

companies are deploying twiki in different ways, and twiki is
quite flexible to adapt to different needs. here is a non- comprehensive 
list of how twiki is being used:


 to replace a static intranet. content is maintained by the 
  employees, thus eliminating the "one webmaster syndrome" of 
  outdated and insufficient intranet content.

 as a knowledge base and faq system. the
  twikisuccessstoryoftakefive
  tells you more about that.

 to design and document software projects.

 to track issues (i.e. bugs) and features. twiki itself is
  managed this way; more on that in the
  codev web.

 as a document management tool.

 to collaborate on common goals, such as the
 javapedia 
 online encyclopedia for java developers on java.net,
 or the biowiki for computational biology projects
 of uc berkeley.

 as a software archive, i.e. the 
 twiki plugins archive.

 as a company internal message board, i.e. for job listings.


what are the main features of twiki?
twiki is a mature, full featured web based collaboration system:


any web browser: edit existing pages or create new
     pages by using any web browser. there is no need for ftp or
     http put to upload pages.

edit link: to edit a page, simply click on the edit
     link at the bottom of every page.

auto links: web pages are 
     linked automatically.
     you do not need to learn html commands to link pages.

text formatting: simple, powerful and easy to learn
     text formatting rules.
     basically you write text like you would write an e-mail.

webs: pages are grouped into
     twiki webs
     (or collections). this allows you to set up separate 
     collaboration groups.

search: full text search
     with/without regular expressions. see a sample 
     search result.

e-mail notification: get automatically notified when
     something has changed in a twiki web. subscribe in 
     webnotify.

structured content: use
     twiki forms
     to classify and categorize unstructured web pages and to
     create simple workflow systems.

file attachments:
     upload
     and download any file as an attachment to a page by 
     using your browser. this is similar to file attachments
     in an e-mail, but it happens on web pages.

revision control: all changes to pages and attachments
     are tracked. retrieve previous page revisions and differences
     thereof. find out who changed what and when.

access control: define groups and impose fine grained
     read and write access restrictions based on groups and users.

variables: use 
     variables
     to dynamically compose your pages. this allows you
     for example to dynamically build a table of contents:
     include other pages; or show a search result embedded in
     a page.

twiki plugins: enhance the twiki functionality with server side
     plugin modules.
     developers can create perl plugins using the 
     twiki plugin api. 
     some example plugins:
  
autocompleteplugin:
     auto-complete input fields of html forms.
  
calendarplugin:
     show a monthly calendar with highlighted events. 
  
chartplugin:
     create charts to visualize twiki tables.
  
databaseplugin:
     get access to data in a database.
  
headlinesplugin:
     build news portals that show headline news based on rss news feeds from news sites.
  
twikidrawplugin:
     use the twikidraw java applet to create editable drawings embedded in topics.
  
slideshowplugin:
     turn twiki pages into web-based presentations.
  
spreadsheetplugin:
     add spreadsheet formulae like $sum($above()) to twiki tables.
  
xptrackerplugin:
     track extreme programming (xp) projects.
  
more...


application wiki: contributors use the twiki platform to create web
  applications. the twiki variables, plugins and sample applications offer
  a rich environment where domain-specific applications can be built
  efficiently by contributors with moderate skill sets. developers can create
  new plugins to enhance the functionality of twiki even further.
  some example applications:
  
call center status board:
     simple status board where time and person can be picked from a list.
  
change request:
     generic change request application.
  
meeting minutes:
     keep track of meeting minutes with action items.
  
search book titles:
     simple application to search a library of books.
  
simple faq:
     faq with all questions on one page and an automatic toc.
  

templates and skins: a flexible templating system
     separates program logic and presentation. skins overwrite
     template headers and footers; page content is unaffected. 

managing pages: individual pages can be renamed, 
     moved and deleted through the browser.

managing users: web based user registration and
     change of password.

what's new:
     see recent changes
     of twiki webs. the change log can also be exported in 
     xml rss format
     for news syndication.

statistics:
     create statistics
     of twiki webs. find out most popular pages and top 
     contributors.

preferences: four levels of preferences:
     twikipreferences
     for site-level; 
     webpreferences
     for each web; user level preferences; and page level preferences.

conflict resolution: content is merged automatically if more than
     one user is edit a page at the same time. in rare cases where a 
     conflict cannot be resolved automatically, users are warned and 
     guided to resolve the conflict manually.

referred-by: find out back-links to a page.

... plus many more features not listed here.
